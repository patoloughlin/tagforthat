Developers Note:
This was just a school project for CSCE 470, Information Storage and Retrieval. If you *really* want to use this software, you are welcome to, but I don't imagine anybody will be too terribly interested in it.

Note that we are not affiliated with Stack Overflow in any way. If Stack Overflow has issues with us using their data, we will remove this project at their request. We're not trying to tread on any unknown licenses, copyrights, or things of that nature.
