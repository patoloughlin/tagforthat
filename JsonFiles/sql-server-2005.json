Out of 103K customers, tt is currently generating a list of 8.5M potential matches (based on the phonetic codes) in 2.25 minutes, and then taking another 2 to score, rank and filter those down to about 3000. So I am happy with the performance, I just can't help but think there is a better way to structure this, and I need help adding the extra union condition.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I seem to have the additional union working.

Luckily transactional data volumes are rather small, however over a two year period the final partition has grown to an impressive 22GB size.  I do not wish to split or remove data from this existing partition.

I added a second database log file with unlimited growth and attempted to alter the Partition Function again.  The original database transaction log filled up as expected, but the secondary database transaction log grew to 60GB!  In addition the tempdb grew to 14GB.  The new filegroup started to increase in size when the whole process aborted again due to a different error.  This time the error was:</p>\n\n<p>('Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'table_name' with unique index 'Index_name').</p>\n\n<p>Now there are TWO things that completely puzzle me here:</p>\n\n<p>1): The index mentioned in the error from testing is a Non-Clustered, Non-Unique Index - why would I get a duplicate error?</p>\n\n<p>2): More to the point, I am adding a new datetime value as a new maximum boundary point and this value does not exist in the table yet.  Why would there be data movement???</p>\n\n<p>As said I have tested this method using a much smaller data set and it worked perfectly.  I don't understand why it will not work with the production dataset.  Am I missing something very obvious here?  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

On the project I am currently working on, the entire site is heavily integrated with the EF model. At first, the access to the EF context was being controlled using an IOC bootstrapper. For operational reasons we were not able to use IOC. I removed this and used a model of individual instances of the context object where required. I started getting the following exception:</p>\n\n<p><code>The type 'XXX' has been mapped more than once.</code></p>\n\n<p>We came to the conclusion that the different instances of the context were causing this issue. I then abstracted the context object into a single static instance which was being accessed by each thread/page. I'm now getting one of several exceptions about transactions:</p>\n\n<p><code>New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>The transaction operation cannot be performed because there are pending requests working on this transaction.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>ExecuteReader requires the command to have a transaction when the connection assigned to the command is in a pending local transaction. The Transaction property of the command has not been initialized.</code></p>\n\n<p>The last of these exceptions occurred on a load operation. I wasn't trying to save the context state back to the Db on the thread that failed. There was another thread performing such an operation however.</p>\n\n<p>These exceptions are intermittent at best, but I have managed to get the site to go into a state where new connections were refused due to a transaction lock. Unfortunately I cannot find the exception details.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my first question is, should the EF model be used from a static single instance?

At very minimum i would want the MAX value and MIN value. i cannot just do two columns because that would count the min value twice (using my example) and will not give me accurate data</p>\n\n<p>was trying to be simple with my example but its not providing enough info, here is more:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT Cast(oi.orderid AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + '.' \n                 + Cast(oi.orderitemid AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS OrderNumber,\n       Min(oici.orderitemcorrectionid)                  AS a,\n       Max(oici.orderitemcorrectionid)                  AS b\nFROM   Orderitems oi\n       LEFT JOIN orderitemcorrections oic\n         ON oic.orderid = oi.orderid\n            AND oic.orderitemid = oi.orderitemid\n       LEFT JOIN orderitemcorrectionissues oici\n         ON oici.orderitemcorrectionid = oic.orderitemcorrectionid\n       LEFT JOIN correctiontypes ct\n         ON ct.correctiontypeid = oici.correctiontypeid\nGROUP  BY Cast(oi.orderid AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + '.' \n                   + Cast(oi.orderitemid AS VARCHAR(MAX)) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>sample table data of above query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OrderNumber a   b\n1098048.1   1   2\n1098210.1   160 160\n1098222.1   78  78\n1098300.1   31  31\n1098408.1   4   4\n1098462.1   224 224\n1098468.1   602 602\n1098492.2   1457 1457\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>above is data where a and b are the same\nbelow is where they are different but i want to null any duplicates from a to b</p>\n\n<pre><code>1100268.1   181 191\n1100256.1   306 379\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>more data, not grouped to show duplicates for rows. -- sample raw data</p>\n\n<pre><code>OrderNumber orderitemcorrectionid\n1098048.1   1\n1098048.1   2\n1098210.1   160\n1098210.1   160\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server-2005","triggers"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":195,"score":1,"question_id":9195495,"title":"How do I see the NTusername in trigger?","body":"<p>SQL Server Profiler shows NtUsername.\nHow do I see the NTusername in trigger?</p>\n\n<p>I don't understand.

(it is Monday morning and for some reason this whole thing is turning out to be really hard for me to explain so I am just going to try and post a lot of my code; sorry)  Oh - the table idea has to stay.  Anything else can be changed but the idea of this table and the parsed field was not my idea but it is my responsibility to execute and make work.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Sorry the post is long.  I do suggest a few possible solutions throughout but my problem is ultimately how everything is returned in a dynamically defined table/table variable from something (sp,view,function,anything...).  Please take a minute to read the whole post... </p>\n\n<p>First, I needed a table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE TICKET_INFORMATION ( \n    TICKET_INFO_ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, \n    TICKET_TYPE INT, \n    TARGET_ID INT, \n    TARGET_NAME VARCHAR(100), \n    INFORMATION VARCHAR(MAX),   \n    TIME_STAMP DATETIME DEFAULT GETUTCDATE()\n)\n\n-- insert this row for testing...  \nINSERT INTO TICKET_INFORMATION (TICKET_TYPE, TARGET_ID, TARGET_NAME, INFORMATION) VALUES (1,1,'RT_ID','IF_ID,int=1&amp;IF_ID,int=2&amp;OTHER,varchar(10)=val,ue3&amp;OTHER,varchar(10)=val,ue4')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Information column holds data that needs to be parsed into a table.  This is where I am having problems.  In the resulting table, Target_Name needs to become a column that holds Target_ID as a value for each row in the resulting table.  </p>\n\n<p>The string that needs to be parsed is in this format:\n<code>@var_name1,@var_datatype1=@var_value1&amp;@var_name2,@var_datatype2=@var_value2&amp;@var_name3,@var_datatype3=@var_value3</code></p>\n\n<p>And what I ultimately need as a result (in a table or table variable):</p>\n\n<pre><code>RT_ID       IF_ID       OTHER\n1           1           val,ue3\n1           2           val,ue3\n1           1           val,ue4\n1           2           val,ue4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I need to be able to join on the result.  Initially, I was just going to make this a function that returns a table variable but for some reason I can't figure out how to get it into  an actual table variable.

So, the result I want and need is now in ##global_temp.  How do I put all of that into something that can be returned from a function (or something)?  Or can I get something more useful returned from the exec statement?  In the end, the results of the parsed string need to be in a table that can be joined on and used... Ideally this would have been a view but I guess it can't with all the processing that needs to be done on that information string.  </p>\n\n<p>Ideas?  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Still looking for answers to this.  I would love to have a function that returns a table variable but I don't know how to get the results into a table variable.  The result is currently in a global temporary table.  Would it work if I defined my table variable in the dynamic portion of the code and then it would just magically be there to return?  Or can I somehow select into a table variable from my global temp table, without first defining the columns of the table variable?  Or can I create the table variable when I execute the dynamic part?  The whole problem is because the columns of the end result are dynamic....... so..... I'm not sure how I could clarify the issues I'm having more.  <strong>If a function that returns a table is a good route to go - could someone please provide me with code or a link as an example for returning a table variable with a dynamic column definition from a function?

The application is running a stored procedure which has a transaction in it.  The transaction is wrapped in a TRY/CATCH block.  In the CATCH block, I am raising the error if something in the transaction fails causing it to jump to CATCH.

If that sum is greater than zero, using floating point division, I divide that sum into 100 to obtain a multiplier. If not, the multiplier = 0.</p>\n\n<p>Then I get the sum of the weight of all Items which are greater than zero and the sum of the weight of all completed Items.</p>\n\n<p>I get PercentItemComplete by dividing the sum of Item weights into 100, multiplying it by the sum of the weight of completed Items (those which have a value for DateCompleted).</p>\n\n<p>Then for each ItemCategory in use by a given Task, I calculate a value equal to PercentItemComplete divided by 100 times the CategoryWeightMultiplier times the weight of the category.</p>\n\n<p>PercentTaskComplete is the sum of each of the values in the loop.</p>\n\n<p>That's a mouthful. At any rate, the above formula applied to the inserted data yields these results:</p>\n\n<p>Task 'BRX 2012' percent complete = 50</p>\n\n<p>Task 'BRX 2013' percent complete = 50</p>\n\n<p>Those categories or items which have zero weight are discarded by the formula; whether completed or not, they do not affect the overall percent complete. They are in place only to serve as \"weightless\" reminders for the person planning the Task.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this is enough (and not too much) information.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","sql-server-2008","sql-server-2005","c#-4.0"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":137,"score":2,"question_id":12250645,"title":"asp.net displaying stored procedure results on HtmlTable from codebehind","body":"<p>what is the best way to dynamically create a table from codebehind, where data for it is retrieved from a stored procedure (SQL 2008)??\nAnd will it make difference if I use HtmlTable instead of asp.net Table?\nAppreciate the help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008","sql-server-2005","sql-server-2008-r2","sql-server-2000"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":83,"score":0,"question_id":12245034,"title":"Case not working in Exists in Sql Server","body":"<p>I have a scenario where i have to check a variable for it's default value, and if it has i have to check EXISTS part conditionally with Table2 and if it does not have the default value, i have to check EXISTS part conditionally with Table3.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a sample code:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM tbl1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT CASE WHEN @boolVar = 0 THEN (SELECT 'X' FROM tbl2 WHERE tbl1.col1 = tbl2.col1) ELSE (SELECT 'X' FROM tbl3 where tbl1.col1 = tbl3.col1) END)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Demo query with constants for testing purpose: - </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT 1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT CASE WHEN 1 = 0 THEN (SELECT 'X' WHERE 1=0) \n    ELSE (SELECT 'X' WHERE 1 = 2) END)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: - The above query always returning 1, even not a single condition is satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>I know we can use OR operator for the same and any how we can achieve it, but i really want to know that in case both the tables have no rows satisfying their particular where clause, even it's returning all the rows from Table1.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to explain the same with the demo query with constant values.</p>\n\n<p>Please help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2005","alter-table","database-partitioning"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":356,"score":1,"question_id":996277,"title":"Why would 'alter table switch partition' fail silently?","body":"<p>I have a partitioned fact table on a SQL Server 2005 (Ent, Ed., 32 bit, SP2) that I am constructing a partition for (the fact table is a snapshot type).

I don’t know if I understand it correctly, but what I except is, that index will be created per partition separately.</p>\n\n<p>Generally how my code looks like in development phase.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\nMaybe it looks like complicated, but instead of static upper bound, \nI use function to determine end of the month for the current year.\n\nSo for example (executed in year 2009)\n    SELECT DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1901)*12)+1-1,31-1)) \nreturns \n    2008-01-30 23:59:59.997\n*/\nCREATE PARTITION FUNCTION PartitionMonthlyCurrentYear(DATETIME) AS\nRANGE LEFT FOR VALUES\n(\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1901)*12)+1-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+1-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+2-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+3-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+4-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+5-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+6-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+7-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+8-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+9-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+10-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+11-1,31-1)),\n    DATEADD(ms, -2, DATEADD(month,((DATEPART(YEAR, GetDate())-1900)*12)+12-1,31-1))\n);\n\n/*\nCreate scheme on the primary file group.

If I drop index, still can’t drop scheme and function because there is still dependency on table *Log_Seiten_archiv*</li>\n<li>How can I assign table to use different partition function?

Let me know if you need any more detailed info about the tables. </p>\n\n<p>I guess im basically looking for a way to dynamically populate rather than list out each column.  Ive seen a few different ways with pivots and case statements but im not very good with pivots yet and case seemed like it would be even more inefficient.  Thanks!</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\nOrderNumber\n,Product\n,OrderDate\n,   oifd1.value as  'ADD_SUBJ_ADDRESS'\n,   oifd2.value as  'ADD_SUBJ_BATHS'\n,   oifd3.value as  'ADD_SUBJ_BEDROOMS'\n,   oifd4.value as  'ADD_SUBJ_DATE'\n,   oifd5.value as  'ADD_SUBJ_GLA'\nFROM(\nSELECT CAST(oi.orderid as VARCHAR(MAX))+'.'+CAST(oi.orderitemid as VARCHAR(MAX))     as      OrderNumber\n,p.abbreviation as product, o.orderdate\nFROM OrderItems oi\njoin products p on p.productid = oi.productid\njoin orders o on o.orderid = oi.orderid)x\nleft    join    orderitemformdatafields     oifd1   on      oifd1.orderreference    =   OrderNumber and oifd1.fieldname in  (     'SUBJ_STREET_ADDR')\nleft    join    orderitemformdatafields     oifd2   on      oifd2.orderreference    =   OrderNumber and oifd2.fieldname in  (      'ADD_SUBJ_BATHS')\n left   join    orderitemformdatafields     oifd3   on      oifd3.orderreference    =   OrderNumber and oifd3.fieldname in  (      'ADD_SUBJ_BEDROOMS')\n left   join    orderitemformdatafields     oifd4   on     oifd4.orderreference =   OrderNumber and oifd4.fieldname in  (     'ADD_SUBJ_DATE')\nleft    join    orderitemformdatafields     oifd5   on      oifd5.orderreference    =   OrderNumber and oifd5.fieldname in  (     'ADD_SUBJ_GLA')\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005","ssis"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":0,"question_id":12150974,"title":"Create Unique Column in SSIS","body":"<p>I have an SSIS package that takes a table and looks up a whole lot of other columns to end up with a dataset like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ItemID | ProductGroupCode | Product Code\n1      |  AAAA            |\n2      |  AAAA            |\n3      |  BBBB            |\n4      |  BBBB            |\n5      |  CCCC            |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ItemID is unique.

Many Bothans died.   </p>\n\n<p>So, I would like to do this the right way.  What settings or scheduling should I use for the FTS change tracking and population?  Should i set change tracking to off, and then schedule a full population after the DTS imports run?

Great. The execution plan is also very simple, it uses the created index from the two tables and did a Hash join on the receipt_id column then a Stream Aggregate to do the MAX(ph.txn_date_time). So every column in the query is covered by the two added index. </p>\n\n<p>The question is why it used a Hash join on the receipt_id column? I mean since RECEIPT_ID in both indexes are sorted the optimizer should have used a merge join. To figure out why I changed the first index to below (put RECEIPT_ID before Units_No). </p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_pto_subTypeUnitReceipt] ON [dbo].[pto] \n(\n[SUBTYPE] ASC,\n[RECEIPT_ID] ASC,\n[Units_No] ASC\n\n\n)WITH (SORT_IN_TEMPDB = OFF, DROP_EXISTING = ON, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ONLINE = OFF) ON [Indexes]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now I see the Merge join on the RECEIPT_ID column. The query also runs in 170ms. Now obviously the optimizer think the RECEIPT_ID in both indexes are sorted so a merge join is used. But I don't understand why in the first case it doesn't think so?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","sql-server-2005","tsql","optimization"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":22,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7015,"score":22,"question_id":1395275,"title":"Which is better: Bookmark/Key Lookup or Index Scan","body":"<p>I know that an index <strong>seek</strong> is better than an index <strong>scan</strong>, but which is preferable in SQL Server explain plans: Index seek or Key Lookup (Bookmark in SQL Server 2000)?</p>\n\n<p>Please tell me they didn't change the name again for SQL Server 2008...</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","tsql","sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4999,"score":1,"question_id":2927475,"title":"sql server - select top and bottom rows","body":"<p>I'm using Sql Server 2005 and i'm trying to achieve something like:\nIn the same select statement i want to get the first x rows and the last x rows.</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT TOP(5) BOTTOM(5)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course 'bottom' does not exist so i need other solution.\nI believe there is an easy and elegant solution that i'm not getting.\nDoing the select again with Group By Desc is not an option.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005","user-defined-functions"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1468,"score":1,"question_id":2833389,"title":"Finding all Stored procedures calling a function","body":"<p>How can I find out all the stored procedures that are calling a particular user defined function in SQL Server 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Or how to assign a defult value to a parameter in a user defined function so that when a stored procedure calls that function and does not pass any value to that parameter function assumes the default value.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,\nAbhishek jain</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005","identity-column"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":512,"score":0,"question_id":2847789,"title":"Identity column SQL Server 2005 inserting same value twice","body":"<p>I have a stored procedure that inserts into a table (where there is an identity column that is not the primary key- the PK is inserted initially using the date/time to generate a unique value).</p>\n\n<p>We then use SCOPEIDENTITY() to get the value inserted, then there is some logic to generate the primary key field value based on this value, which is then updated back to the table.</p>\n\n<p>In some situations the stored procedure is called simultaneously by more than one process, resulting in \"Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint...\" errors.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to indicate that the identity column is allowing the same number to be inserted for more than one record.</p>\n\n<p>First question- how is this possible?</p>\n\n<p>Second question- how to stop it...there's no error handling currently so I'm going to add some try/ catch logic- but would like to understand the problem fully to deal with properly</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":104,"score":1,"question_id":3191947,"title":"How to obtain only ALL Undocumented Stored Procs in SQL SERVER 2005","body":"<p>If I write </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM sys.all_objects\nWHERE ([type] = 'P');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will get all the SQL Stored Procedure.

I've tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT \n[Level] = \nCase \nt.[Level]\n    WHEN 0 THEN CONVERT(VARCHAR,t.[level])\n    ELSE t.[Level]\nEND\nFROM table t \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this of course still returns 0, just the character, so it's still not doing what I need. I am thinking that there is most likely a better way to do this but am not sure how to approach it. Could anyone give me some advice on how to handle this?

This method\n    seems not to work because the XML file has two nodes (columns) which\n    contains dates. Unfortunately, there is not a uniform Date datatype\n    between SQL and XML.

So something like if there were 100 rows with 8/7/2011, and then 9 rows with 8/8/2011, the final query would produce the date being as /8/7/2011</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","sql","sql-server-2005","cascading-deletes"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":136,"score":2,"question_id":11545722,"title":"SQL DELETE (Cascading DELETE vs. TRIGGERS vs. \"Manual\"-DELETE)","body":"<p>I'm currently working with SQL Server Management Studio 2005 and I'm facing a bit of a problem, but first an extract (the important one) of my DB-schema:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imghack.se/64885\" rel=\"nofollow\">imghack link to the image</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to delete from the <code>test</code> table and everything it is connected to (is composed of).</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, I can't alter the DB anymore (and really wouldn't want to, cause the program using it got too big already).</p>\n\n<p>When I try to delete an entry in the <code>test</code> table and cascading DELETE is turned on for the corresponding foreign key relation the DBMS won't let me do the delete, because it detected some kind of loop (probably caused by the <code>contr_tray</code> table).</p>\n\n<p>When trying to delete an entry manually through my program (using a <code>SqlCommandBuilder</code> or <code>cmd.ExecuteNonQuery())</code> I get this error: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same happens if I use triggers, to \"cascade\" the deletion process downwards.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help me here?

One of the things the framework does is you pass it a query and it will return the number of rows the query has in it (The framework makes heavy use of DataReaders so we need the total before hand for UI things). </p>\n\n<p>The query that the count needs to be done on can be different from project to project (SOL-injection is not a issue, the query is not from user input, just hard coded in from another programmer when they use the framework for their project.) and I was told that just having the programmers write a second query for the count is unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the solution is to do the following (I did not write this, I was just told to fix it).</p>\n\n<pre><code>//executes query and returns record count\npublic static int RecordCount(string SqlQuery, string ConnectionString, bool SuppressError = false)\n{\n\n    //SplitLeft is just myString.Substring(0, myString.IndexOf(pattern)) with some error checking. and InStr is just a wrapper for IndexOf.\n    //remove order by clause (breaks count(*))\n    if (Str.InStr(0, SqlQuery.ToLower(), \" order by \") &gt; -1)\n        SqlQuery = Str.SplitLeft(SqlQuery.ToLower(), \" order by \");\n\n    try\n    {\n        //execute query\n        using (SqlConnection cnSqlConnect = OpenConnection(ConnectionString, SuppressError))\n        using (SqlCommand SqlCmd = new SqlCommand(\"select count(*) from (\" + SqlQuery + \") as a\", cnSqlConnect))\n        {\n            SqlCmd.CommandTimeout = 120;\n            return (Int32)SqlCmd.ExecuteScalar();\n        }\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        if (SuppressError == false)\n            MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, \"Sql.RecordCount()\");\n\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However it breaks on queries like (again, not my query, I just need to make it work)</p>\n\n<pre><code>select [ClientID], [Date], [Balance] \nfrom [Ledger] \nwhere Seq = (select top 1 Seq \n             from [Ledger] as l \n             where l.[ClientID] = [Ledger].[ClientID] \n             order by [Date] desc, Seq desc) \n      and Balance &lt;&gt; 0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>as it will removes everything after the <code>order by</code> and breaks the query. I thought I may go from simple string matching to a more complicated parser, but before I do that I wanted to ask if there is a better way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The order by clause is dropped because if you include it using my method or a CTE you will get the error <code>The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Some more details:</strong> This framework is used for writing conversion applications. We write apps to pull data from a clients old database and move it in to our database format when a customer buys our <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRM</a> software. Often we are working with source tables that are poorly written and can be several Gigs in size. We do not have the resources to hold the whole table in memory so we use a DataReader to pull the data out so everything is not in memory at once. However a requirement is a progress bar with the total number of records to be processed. This RecordCount function is used to figure the max of the progress bar. It works fairly well, the only snag is if the programmer writing the conversion needs to order the data output, having a <code>order by</code> clause in the outer most query breaks <code>count(*)</code></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Partial Solution:</strong> I came up with this while trying to figure it out, it will not work 100% of the time but I think it will be better than the current solution</p>\n\n<p>If I find a order by clause, I then check to see if the first thing in the query is a select (and no Top following) I replace that beginning text with <code>select top 100 percent</code>. It works better but I am not posting this as a solution as I am hoping for a universal solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005","varchar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":11542294,"title":"Date is varchar, convert to float in order to take average date","body":"<p>My dates are varchar(50) and appear like this in my database:      </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2/15/2012</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The table looks like this: (Note: someid is not a primary key, its identifies a group) </p>\n\n<pre><code> |  someid  |   date     |  float_value  | \n |   1      | 2/15/2012  |     3.2       |   \n |   1      | 2/15/2012  |     1.4       |\n |   1      | 2/15/2012  |     2.1       |\n |   1      | 2/16/2012  |     1.8       |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How would I do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select avg(date), avg(float_value)\nwhere someid = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To return something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>|  date     |  float_value  |\n| 2/15/2012 |   2.126       |     \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer isn't average date, but like the date the occurs the most often (in terms of the someid).</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated from the sql experts.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2005","join","select-into"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":88,"score":-1,"question_id":11511843,"title":"Select into and Join Problems","body":"<p>My problem stems from this: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11420983/vba-excel-vs-sql-comparing-values-in-two-rows-loop\">VBA (Excel) vs SQL - Comparing values in two rows (loop)</a></p>\n\n<p>I've modified the script a tad and it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>;WITH data AS \n( \n   SELECT a.i, a.M, b.M as NextM, \n   CASE WHEN a.M = 65 AND b.M = 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS shouldIncreaseQ   \n   FROM MyTable a       \n   LEFT OUTER JOIN MyTable b      \n   ON a.i + 1 = b.i \n), test as\n(\n   SELECT data.M, data.NextM, \n   (SELECT COUNT(*) + 1 FROM data AS ref \n   WHERE ref.shouldIncreaseQ = 1 AND ref.i &lt;= data.i) as Q FROM data \n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now lets select * from test.

I would like to be able to get the column identifiers from the filter objects and select only those from the database so that I don't have to deal with all of the overhead, but I can't find a solution that will allow me to do this, any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Second Question is right now this is all in a view in the database, would it be faster/more efficient to move it to a function or a stored procedure?  Can Linq interact with a stored procedure?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18864,"score":5,"question_id":2523676,"title":"Alter table add multiple columns ms sql","body":"<p>Can anyone tell me where is the mistake in the following query</p>\n\n<pre><code>ALTER TABLE Countries\nADD ( \nHasPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInMaterialStorage bit,\n HasText  bit);\n\nALTER TABLE Regions\nADD ( HasPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInMaterialStorage bit\n HasText  bit);\n\nALTER TABLE Provinces\nADD ( HasPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInMaterialStorage bit\n HasText  bit);\n\n\nALTER TABLE Cities\nADD ( HasPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInMaterialStorage bit\n HasText  bit);\n\nAlter table Hotels\nAdd \n{\n HasPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasPhotoInMaterialStorage bit,\n HasHotelPhotoInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasHotelPhotoInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasHotelPhotoInMaterialStorage bit,\n HasReporterData  bit,\n HasMovieInReadyStorage  bit,\n HasMovieInWorkStorage  bit,\n HasMovieInMaterialStorage bit\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the following errors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 2\nIncorrect syntax near '('.\nMsg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 9\nIncorrect syntax near '('.\nMsg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 15\nIncorrect syntax near '('.\nMsg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 22\nIncorrect syntax near '('.\nMsg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 29\nIncorrect syntax near '{'.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server-2005","c#-2.0","nullable","dbnull"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":425,"score":1,"question_id":8985374,"title":"Why can't I insert DBNull.Value into a nullable image-field in sql server 2005?","body":"<p>Why can't I insert <code>DBNull.Value</code> into a nullable <code>image</code>-field in sql server 2005?</p>\n\n<p>I tried this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(@\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=PrescriptionTrackingSystem;Integrated Security=True\");\n\n            conn.Open();\n\n            SqlTransaction transaction = conn.BeginTransaction();\n\n            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(@\"INSERT INTO Customer(\n                               ID\n                              ,Name\n                              ,TelephoneNumber\n                              ,DateOfBirth,\n                               InsuranceProvider,\n                               PolicyNumber,Photo)\n                          VALUES(\n                               @ID\n                              ,@Name\n                              ,@TelephoneNumber\n                              ,@DateOfBirth,\n                               @InsuranceProvider,\n                               @PolicyNumber,\n                               @Photo)\", conn);\n\n            command.Transaction = transaction;\n\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@ID\", 1000);\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Name\", item.Name);\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@TelephoneNumber\", item.TelephoneNumber);\n            if (item.DateOfBirth != null)\n            {\n                command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@DateOfBirth\", item.DateOfBirth);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@DateOfBirth\", DBNull.Value);\n            }\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@InsuranceProvider\", item.InsuranceProvider);\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@PolicyNumber\", item.PolicyNumber);\n\n            if (item.Photo != null)\n            {\n                command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Photo\", item.Photo);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Photo\", DBNull.Value);\n            }\n\n            int count = command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n\n            transaction.Commit();\n\n            conn.Close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>item is of type <code>Customer</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Customer\n{        \n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public DateTime?

Looking at the logs I see the following error </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>06/06/12 15:43:20.914 [0X0000060C] SPID: 118 Seq: 50736293 [Error: 110003][State: 0][Abs Char: 233][Seq: 0] SYNTAX ERROR: String is\n  missing proper closing quote near (Char Pos: 0x139 Byte Pos: 0x272)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It then clearly shows the entry which is causing this error. While I have sent the bug to the dev team and the fix will go out in the next release, I need to use the current trace file to generate and replay the load. Thus I want to fix the particular entry in the trace file which is causing this error. </p>\n\n<p>Is it possible? I tried opening the trace file in wordpad but wordpad crashed, not surprising that given the trace file is 250MB. Trying to install Vim and see if I can open and change the trace file there, but was wondering if anyone knew of an easier method to do this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["tsql","sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":92,"score":1,"question_id":10923720,"title":"How to reverse-pivot a row into two rows?","body":"<p>Suppose I have the following table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Row_ID String1 String2    Int1 Int2\n1      'James' 'Jiao'     1    2\n2      'Jack'  'Ripper'   1    3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want it to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Row_ID String     Int\n1      'James'    1\n1      'Jiao'     2\n2      'Jack'     1\n2      'Ripper'   3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the Int1/Int2 are never the same.

I don't like this, but for now I have to make the best of it an am brainstorming the best ways to go about this.</p>\n\n<p>Basically every view I create has a similar skeleton, it has several columns that are always pulled and several joins that always happens.  Based on the users input I may add additional SELECT columns, as well as additional joins if they are necessary to access the added display columns.</p>\n\n<p>So basically right now my code looks like this...</p>\n\n<pre><code>string SQL = string.Format(@\"CREATE VIEW {0}\n                             AS\n                             SELECT\n                             Foo.A,\n                             Bar.B,\n                             {1}\n                             FROM\n                             Table\n                             INNER JOIN Foo on Foo.ID = Table.FooID\n                             INNER JOIN Bar on Bar.ID = Table.BarID\n                             {2}\", viewName, displayNames, extraJoins);\nDatabase.ExecuteNonQuery(SQL);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I really don't like this for obvious reasons.

The Sybase Database is the backend for a vendor product which our team does not have the authority to change or manage.</p>\n\n<p>In my initial stages of development, to access the Sybase database, I created a SQL Server Linked Server utilizing the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers on my destination database server.  With this linked server created, I created my SSIS package with a single Data Source - connecting to the MS SQL Server \"Destination\" Database.  Next, in my SSIS package data flow tasks, I configured the OLE DB Source to access single Data Source defined in the package, using SQL commands to access the source linked server (simply using SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM [SybaseLinkedServer].[Database].dbo.[Table]).   The OLE DB Destination within the data flow task utilizes the same connection manager as the OLE DB Source, but makes use of the Table or view - fast load Data access mode.  </p>\n\n<p>Later, in the project, I obtained the Sybase ASE OLE DB Provider (The v12.5.4 OLE DB Provider was no longer available, we had to purchase the v15.7 ASE SDK).  Thinking that removing the Linked Server from the solution would improve performance, I modified the SSIS package to include a new OLE DB Data Source utilizing the Sybase ASE OLE DB Provider to access the Sybase Database directly, and modified the OLE DB Source to use the new ASE OLE DB Data Source with the Table or View Data access mode. </p>\n\n<p>To my surprise, switching the solution from the Linked Server using the OLEDB Provider for ODBC Drivers to the direct OLEDB connection using the Sybase ASE OLEDB Provider produced significantly poorer results, far from my expectations.  <a href=\"http://i55.tinypic.com/71s2f7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">The results from test runs using each method are available at this hyperlink.</a></p>\n\n<p>Has anyone experienced this type of issue and/or is this behavior to be expected?

I have a little experience with 2008, but this is my first battle with 2005, so I'm hoping this turns out to be something simple related to my inexperience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What am I trying to do?</strong> I am developing a sales dashboard in SSRS 2005.  One of the report parameters is a multi-value parameter which I need to pass to a stored procedure.  I found a work around in some blogs, as well as here on SO, and implemented a function which splits a comma delimited varchar, and returns a table.  I need this function to return the correct values from within the procedure, since I am calling stored procedures for the SSRS datasets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Problem:</strong> When I execute the function directly from within SSMS for a given value, I receive a table with 7 rows (as expected).  When I execute a procedure that calls that function, with the same values passed, it only returns 1 row in the table.  The user executing the function and the procedure is also the owner of both objects.</p>\n\n<p>I've done a lot of homework to get to this point prior to posting the question, so I hope I've done my due diligence here.  The client hasn't given me privileges to work with SQL Profiler, so I haven't been able to dig in that direction.</p>\n\n<p>I thought perhaps this could be a permissions issue, but the fact that the function is still executed and does return 1 row instead of 7 confused me. It appears to only return the first number from the comma dilimitted string.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Question:</strong> What the heck is causing the behavior outlined below?

This web service serves up JSON content for use in mobile apps. It uses the Entity Framework on top of MS SQL 2005, and the Interface contract looks like the below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   [ServiceContract]\n    public interface MyService\n    {\n        [WebInvoke(Method = \"GET\", UriTemplate = \"/GetStuff?skip={skip}&amp;take={take}&amp;loanAmt={loanAmt}&amp;propertyVal={propertyVal}&amp;Term={Term}&amp;MonthlyRent={MonthlyRent}\", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\n        [OperationContract]\n        ProductsDTO GetProducts(int skip, int take, decimal loanAmt, decimal propertyVal, int Term, decimal MonthlyRent);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The implementation looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public ProductsDTO GetProducts(int skip, int take, decimal loanAmt, decimal propertyVal, int Term, decimal MonthlyRent)\n    {\n       //Some set up code\n      using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities()) \n        {\n              //Get our products\n        }\n\n     return ReturnedList\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the first run of this, it can take anywhere up to 15 seconds (unacceptable for a mobile app), on subsequent runs, the data comes back in under a second. After 5 minutes of inactivity, the WCF service reverts to taking 15 seconds to start. </p>\n\n<p>I initially thought the bottle neck was at IIS7 and thought my App Pool was shutting off. After setting the App Pool to never recycle and studying w3wp.exe processes on the IIS server, I realized this was not the case. It is the database session that is shutting off after those five minutes.</p>\n\n<p>This being the case, I want to hold a SQL session open to immediately serve up requests from the WCF application, however, I don't want to set the Entity Context as a singleton or leave this open in the service as I understand this is poor practise. I could pass a SQL connection object TO the context (using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities(MySQLConnection))) and hold that open? Or can someone suggest something else? </p>\n\n<p>I had seen lots of posts with scripts that touch the web service to keep it alive which gave me the creeping horrors, so have avoided going down this route. </p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong> </p>\n\n<p>As per Andomars response, I have added the following initialization code to the WCF service.</p>\n\n<pre><code>   public Service1()\n        {\n            // Blocking call that initializes\n            // the service instance\n            this.Initialize();\n        }\n\n        BackgroundWorker KeepSQLAlive = new BackgroundWorker();\n\n        private void Initialize()\n        {\n            KeepSQLAlive.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(KeepSQLAlive_DoWork);\n\n            KeepSQLAlive.RunWorkerAsync();\n        }\n\n        void KeepSQLAlive_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)\n        {\n            Timer pingback = new Timer(180000);\n\n            pingback.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(pingback_Elapsed);\n\n            pingback.Start();\n        }\n\n        void pingback_Elapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities ())\n            {\n                context.ExecuteStoreCommand(\"select @@servername\");\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This feels like a bit of a fudge, and I'm a bit worried without creating the service as a singleton the service will continue to spawn SQL sessions without ever killing any. However, if it works it is the path of least resistance as hosting this code in a windows service would take more time and I am unclear how to integrate this in with IIS security (I want to use SSL). I will report back whether the above works.

What that does is fires a stored proc in a MS sql server db - fetches rows with 14 columns and all Strings. Once we get that and extract from the resultset we directly stream it down to a csv file on teh client's machine. That way we are saving creating intermediate domain objects(equal to number of rows retuned) in memory before starting the streaming operation. Also we donot wait until the whole resultset has been loaded in memory.\nHowever say for clients who has e..g 80000 instances of such data - it is still spiking up the memory by 50 mb - then there is a fall of around 20 mb and it remains at that level for quite sometime. If I do a Perform GC on jconsole it frees the remaining 30 mb as well. Not sure what is causing that to linger for sometime. Also the 50 mb spike is unnacceptable for a application running on 1.2 gig memory. for bigger clients it shots up by 400 mb and freezes the application or OOM happens.\nAny suggestion how we can achieve this? \nPLEASE note - I have implemented teh same thing in another place and there is downloads a file of same size but different data(6 columns) in 5 secs and with a memory spike of only 5 mb. In this case it took the stored proc to run in only 4 secs though when run on Sql Mnagament studio. But the one for which i am getting a huge spike the query itself takes 45 secs to run and more based on data as it passes it through a lot of validation. Can that have an adverse effect?
