Many thanks.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array \n(\n[4791063199] =&gt; stdClass Object\n    (\n        [box_header_text_color] =&gt; 393837\n        [link_color] =&gt; EE6600\n        [box_background_color] =&gt; FFFFFF\n        [box_border_color] =&gt; D9D4D0\n        [timezone] =&gt; Europe/London\n        [organizer] =&gt; stdClass Object\n            (\n                [url] =&gt; http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2866607767\n                [description] =&gt; \n                [long_description] =&gt; \n                [id] =&gt; 2866607767\n                [name] =&gt; B&amp;Q Manifestival\n            )\n\n        [background_color] =&gt; E3DFDC\n        [id] =&gt; 4791063199\n        [category] =&gt; \n        [box_header_background_color] =&gt; F0ECE9\n        [capacity] =&gt; 20\n        [num_attendee_rows] =&gt; 0\n        [title] =&gt; Closed Event Test\n        [start_date] =&gt; 2012-11-07 19:00:00\n        [status] =&gt; Live\n        [description] =&gt; Lorem ipsum\n        [end_date] =&gt; 2012-11-07 21:00:00\n        [tags] =&gt; \n        [timezone_offset] =&gt; GMT+0000\n        [text_color] =&gt; 393837\n        [title_text_color] =&gt; \n        [password] =&gt; \n        [tickets] =&gt; Array\n            (\n                [0] =&gt; stdClass Object\n                    (\n                        [ticket] =&gt; stdClass Object\n                            (\n                                [description] =&gt; \n                                [end_date] =&gt; 2012-11-07 17:00:00\n                                [min] =&gt; 1\n                                [max] =&gt; 1\n                                [price] =&gt; 0.00\n                                [quantity_sold] =&gt; 0\n                                [visible] =&gt; true\n                                [currency] =&gt; GBP\n                                [quantity_available] =&gt; 20\n                                [type] =&gt; 0\n                                [id] =&gt; 15940001\n                                [name] =&gt; Manifestival Event\n                            )\n\n                    )\n\n            )\n\n        [created] =&gt; 2012-11-07 10:40:36\n        [url] =&gt; http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4791063199\n        [box_text_color] =&gt; 393837\n        [privacy] =&gt; Private\n        [venue] =&gt; stdClass Object\n            (\n                [city] =&gt; \n                [name] =&gt; HR Training Room\n                [country] =&gt; \n                [region] =&gt; \n                [longitude] =&gt; 0\n                [postal_code] =&gt; \n                [address_2] =&gt; \n                [address] =&gt; \n                [latitude] =&gt; 0\n                [country_code] =&gt; \n                [id] =&gt; 2619469\n                [Lat-Long] =&gt; 0.0 / 0.0\n            )\n\n        [modified] =&gt; 2012-11-07 10:47:20\n        [repeats] =&gt; no\n    )\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","sorting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13276807,"title":"Sorting Array in Java to descending order","body":"<p>I'm playing around with arrays and enums and i was wondering whats the most effect way to create a Comparator class to sort these dates in descending order.

While enums can often be translated into C-style array indices with relative ease...</p>\n\n<pre><code>enum Weekday = {\n    SUNDAY,\n    MONDAY,\n    TUESDAY,\n    WEDNESDAY,\n    THURSDAY,\n    FRIDAY,\n    SATURDAY\n}\n\n// hopefully C doesn't allow nonsequential enum values; else pray to God\n// no one does something like setting Sunday = 4 and Saturday = 4096\nint numberOfDays = Saturday-Sunday+1;\n\nint hoursWorkedPerDay[numberOfDays];\n\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)SUNDAY] = 0;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)MONDAY] = 8;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)TUESDAY] = 10;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)WEDNESDAY] = 6;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)THURSDAY] = 8;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)FRIDAY] = 8;\nhoursWorkedPerDay[(int)SATURDAY] = 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...we are still required to maintain consistency between the number of enums and the size of the array (however, this isn't an awful solution because there's not a more valid integer mapping for \"SUNDAY\" than 0), and more importantly, anything that can be cast to an int could still be dropped into the index to manipulate the array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// continued from above\nvoid resetHours (void) {\n    int i = 0;\n    int hours = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i&lt;numberOfDays; i++) {\n        hoursWorkedPerDay[hours] = i;\n        // oops, should have been: \"...[i] = hours;\"\n        // an enum-indexed implementation would have caught this\n        // during compilation\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the entire conversion from enum to int is an entire layer of complexity that seems unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone please explain whether there is validity to enum-indices, and list some pros and cons to each approach? And perhaps why a feature so seemingly useful is missing from the C standard, if such information exists?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","implementation","resizable"],"answer_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1786,"score":7,"question_id":2581972,"title":"How can I make a resizable array in Java?","body":"<p>What is the best way to do a resizable array in Java?

Below, I will list my issue, and the research I have put into it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The scenario:</strong> I was given a .csv file with 5000 rows and three columns. The three columns are defined as:</p>\n\n<p>Site ID|Site Name|Site URL</p>\n\n<p><strong>My task:</strong> To create an HTML interface for the designers of the company to rate each site on a scale of 1-5. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My plan of action:</strong> I am a new hire. I am getting accustomed to the language I was hired for, which was Objective-C. </p>\n\n<p>My algorithm for the project was to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Parse the .csv</li>\n<li>Remove the \"Site Name\" variable</li>\n<li>Create a new .csv that contains the below variables: Site ID|Site URL|Rating|Image</li>\n<li>Display the new .csv (with all aforementioned items) as an HTML page where there are toggles for \"Ratings\", which when pressed, will log the rating into the .csv which it was imported (or loaded) from. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The \"Image\" section I will be using a piece of software by the name of Paparazzi (on the Mac OS X operating system) which takes a fully formatted screenshot of the main page and saves it as a PNG file. I plan on using the file extension URL (which is stored locally) and load it into the \"Image\" column, thus when the designer clicks on the image, he is able to load the image that is stored locally. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My issue:</strong> As Objective-C is not entirely a scripting language, I am confused with some of the libraries I may need and/or methods I can implement this. I have the algorithm, but I am wholy unsure with the implementation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong> If you have done a project similar to this before with Objective-C, what tips can you provide for me? How does one load the .csv as a HTML interface where upon edit, it will save this edit into the .csv? Will I need any servers for this, or is everything executable from just a machine? How do you grab an image (stored locally), extract its file extension, and load it onto the .csv? </p>\n\n<p>The most important question: Is this achievable through Objective-C? My reasoning behind it is, I want to advance my knowledge of OC through a task like this. Yes, using Python is easier, but is it possible to do this with Objective-C?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","checkbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":1,"question_id":13237014,"title":"how to display checked or checked in edit data php?","body":"<p>i have</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\"&gt;\n    function setCheckboxes3(act) {\n        var e = document.getElementsByClassName('names');\n        var elts_cnt  = (typeof(e.length) != 'undefined') ? e.length : 0;\n        if (!elts_cnt) {\n            return;\n        }\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; elts_cnt; i++) {\n            e[i].checked = (act == 1 || act == 0) ? act : (e[i].checked ? 0 : 1);\n        }\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(1);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Semua&lt;/a&gt; |\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(0);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Tidak Satupun&lt;/a&gt; |\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(2);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Balik Pilihan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[1]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pembinaan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[2]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Intelijen&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[3]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pengawasan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[4]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidum&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[5]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidsus&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[6]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Datun&lt;br/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how to display checked or checked in edit data ???\n(make array if 0=not checked and if 1=checked)</p>\n\n<p>example 100001</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[1]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" checked=\"checked\" /&gt;Pembinaan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[2]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Intelijen&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[3]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pengawasan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[4]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidum&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[5]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidsus&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[6]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" checked=\"checked\" /&gt;Datun&lt;br/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","arrays","methods"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":44,"score":-1,"question_id":13236535,"title":"Iterating a value from inside an 'onClick'","body":"<p>I'm using the logic below to iterate through an array names[] and show a different result on button click.</p>\n\n<pre><code>i = intent.getIntExtra(MainActivity.EXTRA_INDEX, 0);\n    j = i;\n\nwhile (i==j)\n    {\n        j=j+1;\n    final TextView nameView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.vNames);\n    String vName = names[i];\n    nameView.setText(vName);\n\n    Button nextButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.nextButton);\n    nextButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            i=i+1;\n            return;\n        };\n    });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is getting out of the onClick method with the new values.

However, the return value of one of the functions is a <strong>double[] passed as a parameter</strong>, the content of which <strong>doesn't make it back to MATLAB</strong> due to how interaction with Java is implemented.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way around this problem, without modifying the way the DLL returns the data?</p>\n\n<p>Here are the ugly details:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyClass\n{\n    static\n    {\n        System.load(\"C:\\\\fullpath\\\\mydll.dll\");\n    }\npublic static native long   SetFWD(double fwd);\npublic static native long   GetFWD(double fwd[]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is visible from within MATLAB once I set the javapath correctly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt; methods MyClass -full\n\nMethods for class MyClass:\n\nstatic long GetFWD(double[])\nMyClass()\nstatic long SetFWD(double)\n[and stuff inherited from java.lang.Object]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can call the function SetFWD from within MATLAB, but I can't get GetFWD to return anything:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myobj=MyClass;\nfwd=3.0;\nmyobj.SetFWD(fwdval); % this works fine\nfwd=0.0;\nmyobj.GetFWD(fwd); % this does not give an error, but fwd stays unmodified - as one would expect in MATLAB\nfwd = javaArray ('java.lang.Double',1);\nfwd(1) = java.lang.Double(0.0);\nmyobj.GetFWD(fwd) % this gives the error \"???

The user will enter student name followed by the class title, units and grade received for each class he or she has taken.  When finished entering class information for a student, the user will just press Enter (an empty string) and to end entering more students, he or she will do the same for the student name. \n\nExample:\n\nEnter student name: Maria Gomez\n\nEnter class title: English 101\nEnter units for English 101: 3 \nEnter grade for English 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: Kevin Duran\n\nEnter class title: Poly Sci 101\nEnter units for Poly Sci 101: 3 \nEnter grade for Poly Sci 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more students]\n\nOnce all Studnets have been entered, pass each element of the array of Student structures (element by element) to a gpa function which will compute and return the gpa for each Student using the classes array within each Student structure which contains the units and grade for each class taken by the student.  Store the gpa returned by the above function in the gpa member of the Student structures.  GPA is calculated by multiplying the number of units for each class by the points received for that class, and then adding all these products together and dividing it by total number of units.  The points received for a class is based on the grade: for A, it's 4; for B, it's 3; for C, it's 2; for D it's 1; and for F it's 0.  For example, if a student has take 3 classes with 3, 4, and 3 units and has received A, B, and C for these classes, respectively, then, the GPA will be 3 x 4 + 4 x 3 + 3 x 2 / 10 = 3.0.\n\nPrint all students showing name, followed by all classes taken, the grade received and the gpa using a display function which receives the array and its size as parameters.\n\nThen, using a sort_name function, sort the student structures based on their last names and for each student, sort the classes he or she is taking based on class title.  Display the sorted list of students using the display function by calling it from main.\n\nFor example:\n\nKevn Duran\nPoly Sci 101, A\nMath 150, B\nGPA: 3.0\n\nMaria Gomez:\nEnglish 101, A\nMath 201, C\nGPA: 2.9\n\nRobert Small\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, D\nGPA: 1.9\n\nTom Wang\nComp Science 808, A\nComp Science 839, B\nGPA: 3.5\n\nThen, sort the students based on their GPA's using a sort_gpa function and print the list again using the display function. \n\nThen, ask what to search for - name or gpa.  If name is selected, read a student name from the user and, using a binary search function that takes the array, its size and the name to search for, finds the student and displays all of his or her information (name, gpa, units and list of classes taken).\n\nExample:\n\nEnter a student name:  Robert Small\n\nRobert Small:\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, B\nGPA: 2.5\n\nIf GPA is selected, read a GPA and using another binary search find the student with the given GPA by passing the students array, its size and the GPA to search for.  Display the name of the student with the specified GPA in main.  \n\nExample:\n\nEnter GPA to search for:  2.5\n\nRobert Small was found with the GPA of 2.5\n\nIf the name or GPA is not found, tell the user it was not found; e.g.: There was no student with a GPA of 2.5; or Robert Small was not found.\n\nThen, pass the array of student atructures and the size to a stats function which will return the average of the GPA's of all students and through two reference parameters will output the student structures that have the minimum and maximum GPA's.  Print the average GPA, as well as the names of the students who have the minimum and maximum GPA in main, like so:\n\nAverage GPA = 3.17\n\nRobert Small has the minimum GPA of 2.5.\n\nTom Wang has the maximum GPA of 3.5. \n\nFinally, read a maximum and minimum GPA from the user and pass the array of student structures and its size, as well as two other arrays of student structures of the same size to a function which will store all students with a GPA of above the minimum in the highGPA array and all those with a GPA below the maximum in the lowGPA array.  Display the students stored in these two arrays by passing them each from main to the display function.  In other words, the highlow function receives two uninitalized arrays of student structures and populates them based on the GPA criteria passed to it (minimum GPA and maximum GPA).  Then, upon return to main, main passes each of these arrays to the display function to display them.  For example, if the user enters 2.0 for the maximum GPA, the lowGPA array gets filled out with all those students who have a GPA of less than 2.0.  Likewise, if the minimum GPA is 3.5, the highlow function populates the highGPA array with those students who have a GPA of 3.5 or higher.\n\nExample:\n\nEnter maximum GPA:  2.0\n\nEnter minimum GPA:  3.5\n\nStudents with a GPA of lower than 2.0:\n\nRobert Small 1.9\n\nStudents with a GPA of 3.5 or higher:\n\nTom Wang 3.5\n\nWhen writing the highlow function, take advantage of the fact that the array elements are sorted based on the GPA, so to find all the students with a GPA of equal to or higher than the minimum GPA, it doesn't make sense to start from the first element in the array. Instead you can start from the midpoint. If the midpoint is lower than the minimum GPA, you can increment the index until the midpoint is no longer smaller and then all the GPA's from that point on will be larger and part of the high GPA's.  For low GPA's of course, you'd want to start from the beginning of the array and compare and store each that's lower than the maximum until they are no longer lower.\n\nFunctions you must write for this assignment (in addition to main):\n\ninitialize, read, display, sort_name, sort_gpa, search-name, search_gpa, stats, highlow.\n\nUpload your cpp and exe files using the Browse and Upload buttons below and click Finish once both have been uploaded to the site.*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is causing the struct array inside the parent struct to be reset?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","session","variables"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13203246,"title":"Search through the Sessions Variable Array and update","body":"<p>I am using this code to output all the registered session variables - </p>\n\n<pre><code> echo \"&lt;pre&gt;\";\n print_r($_SESSION);\n echo \"&lt;/pre&gt;\";\n exit();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what I get</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array\n (\n[language] =&gt; english\n[navigation] =&gt; navigationHistory Object\n    (\n        [path] =&gt; Array\n            (\n                [0] =&gt; Array\n                    (\n                        [get] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                        [post] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                    )\n\n                [1] =&gt; Array\n                    (\n\n                        [get] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                        [post] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n\n                                [cart_number] =&gt; XXXXXXXXXXXX\n                                [x] =&gt; 62\n\n                            )\n                )\n\n\n            )\n\n        )\n )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>I would like to update the <strong>cart_number</strong> variable in the Session Array from XXXXXXXX... to 555555.

However here is where my confusion occurs. </p>\n\n<p>On the \"playFile()\" event that is triggered (when the user clicks an element), I attempt to simply determine which file the user wants to play, and then call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediaFiles[item].play();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this is the ONLY place that it does not work!

Then when an onPlay() event was triggered, I would create a media object with the source of the item I wanted to play (the source per item was store in shared preferences as a key-value pair) and would play the file back flawlessly, then I would proceed to release the object either when the user stopped playing the file or when the file reached the end of playing (triggered the onSuccess callback). </p>\n\n<p>This was working fine however, sometimes if a user were to try to play and stop a file repeatedly, at times the object status callback would show that the file is in a state of \"1\", which corresponds to \"MEDIA_STARTING\" and would STAY in that state, without changing or actually proceeding to change to \"MEDIA_RUNNING\"-file state 2. This problem would occur on and off sporadically and I wasn't able to resolve it. </p>\n\n<p>Also, at times, when recording a  file it would get stuck in a state of 0, or MEDIA_NONE...</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the files would simply sometimes either get stuck in state 0 or 1 and would hang, then I would get the \"ERROR: Object [object]\"  alert...</p>\n\n<p>So i figured If i could just have 5 different media files and create them on record, never release, and play them at my own will (one at a time however)- then that would be fine. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13197702,"title":"Resize an Array while keeping current elements in Java?","body":"<p>I have searched for a way to resize an array in Java, but I could not find ways of resizing the array <em>while keeping the current elements</em>.

The user will enter student name followed by the class title, units and grade received for each class he or she has taken.  When finished entering class information for a student, the user will just press Enter (an empty string) and to end entering more students, he or she will do the same for the student name. \n\nExample:\n\nEnter student name: Maria Gomez\n\nEnter class title: English 101\nEnter units for English 101: 3 \nEnter grade for English 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: Kevin Duran\n\nEnter class title: Poly Sci 101\nEnter units for Poly Sci 101: 3 \nEnter grade for Poly Sci 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more students]\n\nOnce all Studnets have been entered, pass each element of the array of Student structures (element by element) to a gpa function which will compute and return the gpa for each Student using the classes array within each Student structure which contains the units and grade for each class taken by the student.  Store the gpa returned by the above function in the gpa member of the Student structures.  GPA is calculated by multiplying the number of units for each class by the points received for that class, and then adding all these products together and dividing it by total number of units.  The points received for a class is based on the grade: for A, it's 4; for B, it's 3; for C, it's 2; for D it's 1; and for F it's 0.  For example, if a student has take 3 classes with 3, 4, and 3 units and has received A, B, and C for these classes, respectively, then, the GPA will be 3 x 4 + 4 x 3 + 3 x 2 / 10 = 3.0.\n\nPrint all students showing name, followed by all classes taken, the grade received and the gpa using a display function which receives the array and its size as parameters.\n\nThen, using a sort_name function, sort the student structures based on their last names and for each student, sort the classes he or she is taking based on class title.  Display the sorted list of students using the display function by calling it from main.\n\nFor example:\n\nKevn Duran\nPoly Sci 101, A\nMath 150, B\nGPA: 3.0\n\nMaria Gomez:\nEnglish 101, A\nMath 201, C\nGPA: 2.9\n\nRobert Small\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, D\nGPA: 1.9\n\nTom Wang\nComp Science 808, A\nComp Science 839, B\nGPA: 3.5\n\nThen, sort the students based on their GPA's using a sort_gpa function and print the list again using the display function. \n\nThen, ask what to search for - name or gpa.  If name is selected, read a student name from the user and, using a binary search function that takes the array, its size and the name to search for, finds the student and displays all of his or her information (name, gpa, units and list of classes taken).\n\nExample:\n\nEnter a student name:  Robert Small\n\nRobert Small:\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, B\nGPA: 2.5\n\nIf GPA is selected, read a GPA and using another binary search find the student with the given GPA by passing the students array, its size and the GPA to search for.  Display the name of the student with the specified GPA in main.  \n\nExample:\n\nEnter GPA to search for:  2.5\n\nRobert Small was found with the GPA of 2.5\n\nIf the name or GPA is not found, tell the user it was not found; e.g.: There was no student with a GPA of 2.5; or Robert Small was not found.\n\nThen, pass the array of student atructures and the size to a stats function which will return the average of the GPA's of all students and through two reference parameters will output the student structures that have the minimum and maximum GPA's.  Print the average GPA, as well as the names of the students who have the minimum and maximum GPA in main, like so:\n\nAverage GPA = 3.17\n\nRobert Small has the minimum GPA of 2.5.\n\nTom Wang has the maximum GPA of 3.5. \n\nFinally, read a maximum and minimum GPA from the user and pass the array of student structures and its size, as well as two other arrays of student structures of the same size to a function which will store all students with a GPA of above the minimum in the highGPA array and all those with a GPA below the maximum in the lowGPA array.  Display the students stored in these two arrays by passing them each from main to the display function.  In other words, the highlow function receives two uninitalized arrays of student structures and populates them based on the GPA criteria passed to it (minimum GPA and maximum GPA).  Then, upon return to main, main passes each of these arrays to the display function to display them.  For example, if the user enters 2.0 for the maximum GPA, the lowGPA array gets filled out with all those students who have a GPA of less than 2.0.  Likewise, if the minimum GPA is 3.5, the highlow function populates the highGPA array with those students who have a GPA of 3.5 or higher.\n\nExample:\n\nEnter maximum GPA:  2.0\n\nEnter minimum GPA:  3.5\n\nStudents with a GPA of lower than 2.0:\n\nRobert Small 1.9\n\nStudents with a GPA of 3.5 or higher:\n\nTom Wang 3.5\n\nWhen writing the highlow function, take advantage of the fact that the array elements are sorted based on the GPA, so to find all the students with a GPA of equal to or higher than the minimum GPA, it doesn't make sense to start from the first element in the array.

It basically comes down to splitting an array of integers in two (almost) equal halves and returning the smallest possible difference between the two. I have included the problem description below. As noted in the comments this can be described as a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12781159/balanced-partition\">balanced partition problem</a>, which is a problem in the realm of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">dynamic programming</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now similar problems have been discussed a lot, but I was unable find an efficient solution for this particular one. The problem is of course that the number of possible combinations to traverse soon grows too large for a brute force search (at least when using recursion). I have a recursive solution that works fine for all but the largest problem sets. I tried to add some optimizations that stop the recursion early, but the performance is still too slow to solve some arrays of the maximum length (30) within the 5 second maximum allowed by CodeFu.

I may be completely wrong if so please correct me .</code></p>\n\n<p>My second intuition is:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose we have an array of elements as follows : 4,9,7,3,2,1,8,12</p>\n\n<p>we calculate above condition <code>i&lt;j , a[i]&gt;a[j]</code>  for element 4 ,as i=0 points to 4 ,the possible values for j are 3,4,5 .since a[0]>a[3],a[0]>a[4],a[0]>a[5] ,so my total no of (i,j) pairs for now is 3 .\n Next time when I increment i(index) to 1,the possibles values of j are 2,3,4,5,6 . But we should use the fact that when i=0 (when a[i]=4) we have computed 3 elements less than a[i=0] which is in turn less than a[i=1] , so  i will not compare 9 with 3,2,1 (To remove unnecessary computations ).If we can remove unnecessary computations then we can reduce complexity to something less than O(N^2) or else no solution less than O(N^2) exists.But if solution exists then how do we do that.I tried making graph but my efforts are futile .</p>\n\n<p>Approach 1)<code>In-order to obtain O(nlogn) complexity I think we need to tweak around quick sort or merge sort to get solution but problem here is, if we sort the array we loose the actual positions of elements.</code>  </p>\n\n<p>Approach     <code>2)In-order to get solution in O(NlogN) time I think using tree we may get the optimised sollution .

On a different page on the site, I want the users to be able to see all the emails they sent, but I want them to see the names of who they sent it to, rather than the email addresses.  This is why I need both the names and the emails.  I need emails for the mail function, and names to be displayed back to the user.

When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88.

They are working on objects that are on the page from the beginning.<br/>\nHere is what i have:<br/></p>\n\n<pre><code>$(function(){\n    for (var i=0, len=divnames.length; i&lt;len; i++) {\n        if(divnames[i]){\n            (function( ) { // anonymous function to fix closures\n                var index = i; // also needed to fix closures\n                $('#'+divnames[index]).on(\"click\", function() {\n                    objects[index].play();\n                    loadContent(divnames[index]+\".php\");\n                });\n            })( ); // direct function execution to fix closures\n        }\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As stated above, closure problem is fixed by the two commented lines, leaving them away will only ever apply the last execution of the for-loop. As it is now, that works.<br/>\nBut what doesnt work, is that the click function should also be applied to divs matching the selector, but are not yet loaded.<br/>\nBut that does work if the code with the same functionality is not iterated inside a for loop without the closure-fix, because thats expected .on() behaviour if i understand correctly.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>So how do i get both desired functionalities to work?<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time in advance.</p>\n\n<p>----edit----</p>\n\n<p>Additional information as requested:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var divnames = [];\ndivnames[0] = \"home\";\ndivnames[1] = \"about\";\ndivnames[2] = \"projects\";\n\nfunction SpriteAnim (options) {\nvar timerId = 0; \n    var i = 0;\n    this.status = 0;\nthis.init = function () {\n    var element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n    element.style.width = options.width + \"px\";\n    element.style.height = options.height + \"px\";\n    element.style.backgroundRepeat = \"no-repeat\";\n    element.style.backgroundImage = \"url(\" + options.sprite + \")\";\n};\nthis.showFrame = function (which) {\n    if (which &lt; options.frames) {\n                    i = which;\n        element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n        element.style.backgroundPosition = \"0px -\" + which * options.height + \"px\";\n    }\n};\nthis.play = function () {\n            this.status = 2;\n    timerId = setInterval(function () {\n        if (i &lt; (options.frames - 1)) {\n                            i++;\n            element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n            element.style.backgroundPosition = \"0px -\" + i * options.height + \"px\";\n                    } else {\n                        clearInterval(timerId);\n                        this.status = 1;\n                    }\n    }, 100);\n};\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you probably have already guessed, the objects[] array contains 3 SpriteAnim objects in objects[0], objects[1], objects[2].</p>\n\n<pre><code>objects[0] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim1.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim0\"\n});\nobjects[1] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim1.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim1\"\n});\nobjects[2] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim2.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim2\"\n});\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","binary-tree","binary-search-tree"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":1,"question_id":13096540,"title":"Adding an element in an array based Binary Search Tree","body":"<p>So I've stumped on this current problem I'm working on.

The mouseover-part for example is not triggered on div's that are load()ed later on, but very well match the selector</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#'+menu[f][g][h]).\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the alternative solution that i found here on SO, you would remove the comments in the beginning to get that anonymous function, replace all occurences of e.data.** with the appropriate ** only, replace all the .binds with .on and of course remove the { fr:f, gr:g, hr: h} eventData parts. Oh, and remove the comment in the end where the function is directly beeing executed })();<br/><br/>\nAny hint would be great, thanks in advance for your time.</p>\n\n<p>----edit----</p>\n\n<p>Accepted, this is a total mess. Im going to go a different way, thanks for the help.\nYet the logical problem still exists, even in simpler forms, and im really interested in the answer, just to understand what the basic logical problem behind it is.

The game will be top-down 2d and made with XNA 4.0 and C#. You will begin in a randomized area which will essentially be tile based. As such a 2 dimensional array would be one way to accomplish this by holding numerical values which would correspond to a list of textures and that would be how it would draw this randomly created map. The problem is I would kind of only like to create the area around where you start and they could venture in which ever direction they wanted to. This would mean I'd have to populate the map array with more randomized data in the direction they go. I could make a really large array and use the center of it and the rest would be in anticipation of new content to be made, but that just seems very inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose when they start a new game I could have a one time map creation process that would go through and create a large randomly generated map array, but holding all of in memory at all times seems also inefficient. Perhaps if there was a way that I'd only hold parts of that map data in memory at one time and somehow not hold the rest in memory. In the end I only need to have a chunk of the map somewhat close to them in memory so perhaps some of you might have suggestions on good ways to approach this kind of randomized map and dynamic array problem. It wouldn't need to be a dynamic array type of thing if I made it so that it pulled in map data nearby that is needed and then once off the screen and not needed it could somehow get rid of that memory that way I wouldn't have a huge array taking up a bunch of memory.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","2d"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13097149,"title":"constructing a 2D array and assigning","body":"<pre><code>package homework3;\n\npublic class DoubleMatrix\n{\n\n   private double[][] doubMatrix;\n\n   public DoubleMatrix (int row, int col)\n   {\n    if(row &gt; 0 &amp; col &gt; 0)\n    {\n        makeDoubMatrix(1,1);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        row = 1;\n        col = 1;\n    }\n\n}\npublic DoubleMatrix(double[][] tempArray)\n{   \n    int k = tempArray.length;\n    if(tempArray != null)\n    {\n\n\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; tempArray.length;i++)\n        {\n            if(k== tempArray[i].length)\n            {\n\n\n            }\n\n        }   \n     }\n    else\n    {\n        makeDoubMatrix(1,1);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what i was supposed to start my assignment with: \n Write a class called DoubleMatrix in which you declare a 2-dim. array of doubles (I'm calling it doubMatrix) as a private instance variable.

This query should be executed several (possibly tens to hundreds or even thousands) of times per second.

If this is a completely wrong way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks very much!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Taking into consideration what was answered, I was wondering if it would be plausible to use materialized views.  By this I mean having several materialized views (each one for a different parameter value, having the rows where that value is not present).  We the parameter values are, to a certain extent, predictable, so this doesn't seem too far out there as a solution.  This brings another matter into question: Would materialized views help here?  Is there some limitation (either in definition or performance) as to the number of materialized views (or tables) that I can create in a database?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks very much for your help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","arrays","table","checkbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":13079953,"title":"Displaying Checkbox Array and PHP Variable Arrays in HTML Table","body":"<p>and thanks for your interest in my question.</p>\n\n<p>I have an html table that includes 7 columns.
