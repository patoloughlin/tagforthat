From what I've read in my searches here and elsewhere this kind of problem is usually encountered when using ints, but I don't understand why it isn't working with Integers.\nAny insight on the problem would be greatly appreciated as I'm still coming to terms with the concept of generics.\nMany thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["arrays","const","pascal","freepascal","turbo-pascal"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13241106,"title":"How to make dynamic array constant?","body":"<p>There is any way of making x array constant after the data is read from user?

The three columns are defined as:</p>\n\n<p>Site ID|Site Name|Site URL</p>\n\n<p><strong>My task:</strong> To create an HTML interface for the designers of the company to rate each site on a scale of 1-5. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My plan of action:</strong> I am a new hire. I am getting accustomed to the language I was hired for, which was Objective-C. </p>\n\n<p>My algorithm for the project was to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Parse the .csv</li>\n<li>Remove the \"Site Name\" variable</li>\n<li>Create a new .csv that contains the below variables: Site ID|Site URL|Rating|Image</li>\n<li>Display the new .csv (with all aforementioned items) as an HTML page where there are toggles for \"Ratings\", which when pressed, will log the rating into the .csv which it was imported (or loaded) from. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The \"Image\" section I will be using a piece of software by the name of Paparazzi (on the Mac OS X operating system) which takes a fully formatted screenshot of the main page and saves it as a PNG file. I plan on using the file extension URL (which is stored locally) and load it into the \"Image\" column, thus when the designer clicks on the image, he is able to load the image that is stored locally. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My issue:</strong> As Objective-C is not entirely a scripting language, I am confused with some of the libraries I may need and/or methods I can implement this. I have the algorithm, but I am wholy unsure with the implementation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong> If you have done a project similar to this before with Objective-C, what tips can you provide for me? How does one load the .csv as a HTML interface where upon edit, it will save this edit into the .csv? Will I need any servers for this, or is everything executable from just a machine? How do you grab an image (stored locally), extract its file extension, and load it onto the .csv? </p>\n\n<p>The most important question: Is this achievable through Objective-C? My reasoning behind it is, I want to advance my knowledge of OC through a task like this. Yes, using Python is easier, but is it possible to do this with Objective-C?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","checkbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":1,"question_id":13237014,"title":"how to display checked or checked in edit data php?","body":"<p>i have</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\"&gt;\n    function setCheckboxes3(act) {\n        var e = document.getElementsByClassName('names');\n        var elts_cnt  = (typeof(e.length) != 'undefined') ? e.length : 0;\n        if (!elts_cnt) {\n            return;\n        }\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; elts_cnt; i++) {\n            e[i].checked = (act == 1 || act == 0) ? act : (e[i].checked ? 0 : 1);\n        }\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(1);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Semua&lt;/a&gt; |\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(0);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Tidak Satupun&lt;/a&gt; |\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:setCheckboxes3(2);\" class=\"chkmenu\"&gt;Balik Pilihan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[1]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pembinaan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[2]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Intelijen&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[3]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pengawasan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[4]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidum&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[5]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidsus&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[6]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Datun&lt;br/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how to display checked or checked in edit data ???\n(make array if 0=not checked and if 1=checked)</p>\n\n<p>example 100001</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[1]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" checked=\"checked\" /&gt;Pembinaan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[2]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Intelijen&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[3]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pengawasan&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[4]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidum&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[5]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" /&gt;Pidsus&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"listBidang[6]\" class=\"names\" value=\"1\" checked=\"checked\" /&gt;Datun&lt;br/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","arrays","methods"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":44,"score":-1,"question_id":13236535,"title":"Iterating a value from inside an 'onClick'","body":"<p>I'm using the logic below to iterate through an array names[] and show a different result on button click.</p>\n\n<pre><code>i = intent.getIntExtra(MainActivity.EXTRA_INDEX, 0);\n    j = i;\n\nwhile (i==j)\n    {\n        j=j+1;\n    final TextView nameView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.vNames);\n    String vName = names[i];\n    nameView.setText(vName);\n\n    Button nextButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.nextButton);\n    nextButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            i=i+1;\n            return;\n        };\n    });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is getting out of the onClick method with the new values.

However, the return value of one of the functions is a <strong>double[] passed as a parameter</strong>, the content of which <strong>doesn't make it back to MATLAB</strong> due to how interaction with Java is implemented.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way around this problem, without modifying the way the DLL returns the data?</p>\n\n<p>Here are the ugly details:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyClass\n{\n    static\n    {\n        System.load(\"C:\\\\fullpath\\\\mydll.dll\");\n    }\npublic static native long   SetFWD(double fwd);\npublic static native long   GetFWD(double fwd[]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is visible from within MATLAB once I set the javapath correctly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt; methods MyClass -full\n\nMethods for class MyClass:\n\nstatic long GetFWD(double[])\nMyClass()\nstatic long SetFWD(double)\n[and stuff inherited from java.lang.Object]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can call the function SetFWD from within MATLAB, but I can't get GetFWD to return anything:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myobj=MyClass;\nfwd=3.0;\nmyobj.SetFWD(fwdval); % this works fine\nfwd=0.0;\nmyobj.GetFWD(fwd); % this does not give an error, but fwd stays unmodified - as one would expect in MATLAB\nfwd = javaArray ('java.lang.Double',1);\nfwd(1) = java.lang.Double(0.0);\nmyobj.GetFWD(fwd) % this gives the error \"???

The user will enter student name followed by the class title, units and grade received for each class he or she has taken.  When finished entering class information for a student, the user will just press Enter (an empty string) and to end entering more students, he or she will do the same for the student name. \n\nExample:\n\nEnter student name: Maria Gomez\n\nEnter class title: English 101\nEnter units for English 101: 3 \nEnter grade for English 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: Kevin Duran\n\nEnter class title: Poly Sci 101\nEnter units for Poly Sci 101: 3 \nEnter grade for Poly Sci 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more students]\n\nOnce all Studnets have been entered, pass each element of the array of Student structures (element by element) to a gpa function which will compute and return the gpa for each Student using the classes array within each Student structure which contains the units and grade for each class taken by the student.  Store the gpa returned by the above function in the gpa member of the Student structures.  GPA is calculated by multiplying the number of units for each class by the points received for that class, and then adding all these products together and dividing it by total number of units.  The points received for a class is based on the grade: for A, it's 4; for B, it's 3; for C, it's 2; for D it's 1; and for F it's 0.  For example, if a student has take 3 classes with 3, 4, and 3 units and has received A, B, and C for these classes, respectively, then, the GPA will be 3 x 4 + 4 x 3 + 3 x 2 / 10 = 3.0.\n\nPrint all students showing name, followed by all classes taken, the grade received and the gpa using a display function which receives the array and its size as parameters.\n\nThen, using a sort_name function, sort the student structures based on their last names and for each student, sort the classes he or she is taking based on class title.  Display the sorted list of students using the display function by calling it from main.\n\nFor example:\n\nKevn Duran\nPoly Sci 101, A\nMath 150, B\nGPA: 3.0\n\nMaria Gomez:\nEnglish 101, A\nMath 201, C\nGPA: 2.9\n\nRobert Small\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, D\nGPA: 1.9\n\nTom Wang\nComp Science 808, A\nComp Science 839, B\nGPA: 3.5\n\nThen, sort the students based on their GPA's using a sort_gpa function and print the list again using the display function. \n\nThen, ask what to search for - name or gpa.  If name is selected, read a student name from the user and, using a binary search function that takes the array, its size and the name to search for, finds the student and displays all of his or her information (name, gpa, units and list of classes taken).\n\nExample:\n\nEnter a student name:  Robert Small\n\nRobert Small:\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, B\nGPA: 2.5\n\nIf GPA is selected, read a GPA and using another binary search find the student with the given GPA by passing the students array, its size and the GPA to search for.  Display the name of the student with the specified GPA in main.  \n\nExample:\n\nEnter GPA to search for:  2.5\n\nRobert Small was found with the GPA of 2.5\n\nIf the name or GPA is not found, tell the user it was not found; e.g.: There was no student with a GPA of 2.5; or Robert Small was not found.\n\nThen, pass the array of student atructures and the size to a stats function which will return the average of the GPA's of all students and through two reference parameters will output the student structures that have the minimum and maximum GPA's.  Print the average GPA, as well as the names of the students who have the minimum and maximum GPA in main, like so:\n\nAverage GPA = 3.17\n\nRobert Small has the minimum GPA of 2.5.\n\nTom Wang has the maximum GPA of 3.5. \n\nFinally, read a maximum and minimum GPA from the user and pass the array of student structures and its size, as well as two other arrays of student structures of the same size to a function which will store all students with a GPA of above the minimum in the highGPA array and all those with a GPA below the maximum in the lowGPA array.  Display the students stored in these two arrays by passing them each from main to the display function.  In other words, the highlow function receives two uninitalized arrays of student structures and populates them based on the GPA criteria passed to it (minimum GPA and maximum GPA).  Then, upon return to main, main passes each of these arrays to the display function to display them.  For example, if the user enters 2.0 for the maximum GPA, the lowGPA array gets filled out with all those students who have a GPA of less than 2.0.  Likewise, if the minimum GPA is 3.5, the highlow function populates the highGPA array with those students who have a GPA of 3.5 or higher.\n\nExample:\n\nEnter maximum GPA:  2.0\n\nEnter minimum GPA:  3.5\n\nStudents with a GPA of lower than 2.0:\n\nRobert Small 1.9\n\nStudents with a GPA of 3.5 or higher:\n\nTom Wang 3.5\n\nWhen writing the highlow function, take advantage of the fact that the array elements are sorted based on the GPA, so to find all the students with a GPA of equal to or higher than the minimum GPA, it doesn't make sense to start from the first element in the array. Instead you can start from the midpoint. If the midpoint is lower than the minimum GPA, you can increment the index until the midpoint is no longer smaller and then all the GPA's from that point on will be larger and part of the high GPA's.  For low GPA's of course, you'd want to start from the beginning of the array and compare and store each that's lower than the maximum until they are no longer lower.\n\nFunctions you must write for this assignment (in addition to main):\n\ninitialize, read, display, sort_name, sort_gpa, search-name, search_gpa, stats, highlow.\n\nUpload your cpp and exe files using the Browse and Upload buttons below and click Finish once both have been uploaded to the site.*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is causing the struct array inside the parent struct to be reset?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","session","variables"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13203246,"title":"Search through the Sessions Variable Array and update","body":"<p>I am using this code to output all the registered session variables - </p>\n\n<pre><code> echo \"&lt;pre&gt;\";\n print_r($_SESSION);\n echo \"&lt;/pre&gt;\";\n exit();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what I get</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array\n (\n[language] =&gt; english\n[navigation] =&gt; navigationHistory Object\n    (\n        [path] =&gt; Array\n            (\n                [0] =&gt; Array\n                    (\n                        [get] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                        [post] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                    )\n\n                [1] =&gt; Array\n                    (\n\n                        [get] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n                            )\n\n                        [post] =&gt; Array\n                            (\n\n                                [cart_number] =&gt; XXXXXXXXXXXX\n                                [x] =&gt; 62\n\n                            )\n                )\n\n\n            )\n\n        )\n )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>I would like to update the <strong>cart_number</strong> variable in the Session Array from XXXXXXXX... to 555555.

At the top of the .js file an array - mediaFiles = [];  - is initialized, and, upon each \"onRecord\" event that is triggered, I do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediaFiles[counter]= new Media (path, success, error, status) ; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then i do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediaFiles[counter].startRecord and mediaFiles[counter].stopRecord respectively. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that the media file is created successfully, because when I open it with a file manager I can play it back. However here is where my confusion occurs. </p>\n\n<p>On the \"playFile()\" event that is triggered (when the user clicks an element), I attempt to simply determine which file the user wants to play, and then call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediaFiles[item].play();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this is the ONLY place that it does not work!

Then when an onPlay() event was triggered, I would create a media object with the source of the item I wanted to play (the source per item was store in shared preferences as a key-value pair) and would play the file back flawlessly, then I would proceed to release the object either when the user stopped playing the file or when the file reached the end of playing (triggered the onSuccess callback). </p>\n\n<p>This was working fine however, sometimes if a user were to try to play and stop a file repeatedly, at times the object status callback would show that the file is in a state of \"1\", which corresponds to \"MEDIA_STARTING\" and would STAY in that state, without changing or actually proceeding to change to \"MEDIA_RUNNING\"-file state 2. This problem would occur on and off sporadically and I wasn't able to resolve it. </p>\n\n<p>Also, at times, when recording a  file it would get stuck in a state of 0, or MEDIA_NONE...</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the files would simply sometimes either get stuck in state 0 or 1 and would hang, then I would get the \"ERROR: Object [object]\"  alert...</p>\n\n<p>So i figured If i could just have 5 different media files and create them on record, never release, and play them at my own will (one at a time however)- then that would be fine. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13197702,"title":"Resize an Array while keeping current elements in Java?","body":"<p>I have searched for a way to resize an array in Java, but I could not find ways of resizing the array <em>while keeping the current elements</em>.

The user will enter student name followed by the class title, units and grade received for each class he or she has taken.  When finished entering class information for a student, the user will just press Enter (an empty string) and to end entering more students, he or she will do the same for the student name. \n\nExample:\n\nEnter student name: Maria Gomez\n\nEnter class title: English 101\nEnter units for English 101: 3 \nEnter grade for English 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: Kevin Duran\n\nEnter class title: Poly Sci 101\nEnter units for Poly Sci 101: 3 \nEnter grade for Poly Sci 101: A\n\nEnter class title: Math 201\nEnter units for Math 201: 4\nEnter grade for Math 201: B\n\nEnter class title: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more classes]\n\nEnter student name: [User enters RETURN to indicate no more students]\n\nOnce all Studnets have been entered, pass each element of the array of Student structures (element by element) to a gpa function which will compute and return the gpa for each Student using the classes array within each Student structure which contains the units and grade for each class taken by the student.  Store the gpa returned by the above function in the gpa member of the Student structures.  GPA is calculated by multiplying the number of units for each class by the points received for that class, and then adding all these products together and dividing it by total number of units.  The points received for a class is based on the grade: for A, it's 4; for B, it's 3; for C, it's 2; for D it's 1; and for F it's 0.  For example, if a student has take 3 classes with 3, 4, and 3 units and has received A, B, and C for these classes, respectively, then, the GPA will be 3 x 4 + 4 x 3 + 3 x 2 / 10 = 3.0.\n\nPrint all students showing name, followed by all classes taken, the grade received and the gpa using a display function which receives the array and its size as parameters.\n\nThen, using a sort_name function, sort the student structures based on their last names and for each student, sort the classes he or she is taking based on class title.  Display the sorted list of students using the display function by calling it from main.\n\nFor example:\n\nKevn Duran\nPoly Sci 101, A\nMath 150, B\nGPA: 3.0\n\nMaria Gomez:\nEnglish 101, A\nMath 201, C\nGPA: 2.9\n\nRobert Small\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, D\nGPA: 1.9\n\nTom Wang\nComp Science 808, A\nComp Science 839, B\nGPA: 3.5\n\nThen, sort the students based on their GPA's using a sort_gpa function and print the list again using the display function. \n\nThen, ask what to search for - name or gpa.  If name is selected, read a student name from the user and, using a binary search function that takes the array, its size and the name to search for, finds the student and displays all of his or her information (name, gpa, units and list of classes taken).\n\nExample:\n\nEnter a student name:  Robert Small\n\nRobert Small:\nComp Science 801, C\nComp Science 802, B\nGPA: 2.5\n\nIf GPA is selected, read a GPA and using another binary search find the student with the given GPA by passing the students array, its size and the GPA to search for.  Display the name of the student with the specified GPA in main.  \n\nExample:\n\nEnter GPA to search for:  2.5\n\nRobert Small was found with the GPA of 2.5\n\nIf the name or GPA is not found, tell the user it was not found; e.g.: There was no student with a GPA of 2.5; or Robert Small was not found.\n\nThen, pass the array of student atructures and the size to a stats function which will return the average of the GPA's of all students and through two reference parameters will output the student structures that have the minimum and maximum GPA's.  Print the average GPA, as well as the names of the students who have the minimum and maximum GPA in main, like so:\n\nAverage GPA = 3.17\n\nRobert Small has the minimum GPA of 2.5.\n\nTom Wang has the maximum GPA of 3.5. \n\nFinally, read a maximum and minimum GPA from the user and pass the array of student structures and its size, as well as two other arrays of student structures of the same size to a function which will store all students with a GPA of above the minimum in the highGPA array and all those with a GPA below the maximum in the lowGPA array.  Display the students stored in these two arrays by passing them each from main to the display function.  In other words, the highlow function receives two uninitalized arrays of student structures and populates them based on the GPA criteria passed to it (minimum GPA and maximum GPA).  Then, upon return to main, main passes each of these arrays to the display function to display them.  For example, if the user enters 2.0 for the maximum GPA, the lowGPA array gets filled out with all those students who have a GPA of less than 2.0.  Likewise, if the minimum GPA is 3.5, the highlow function populates the highGPA array with those students who have a GPA of 3.5 or higher.\n\nExample:\n\nEnter maximum GPA:  2.0\n\nEnter minimum GPA:  3.5\n\nStudents with a GPA of lower than 2.0:\n\nRobert Small 1.9\n\nStudents with a GPA of 3.5 or higher:\n\nTom Wang 3.5\n\nWhen writing the highlow function, take advantage of the fact that the array elements are sorted based on the GPA, so to find all the students with a GPA of equal to or higher than the minimum GPA, it doesn't make sense to start from the first element in the array.

It basically comes down to splitting an array of integers in two (almost) equal halves and returning the smallest possible difference between the two. I have included the problem description below. As noted in the comments this can be described as a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12781159/balanced-partition\">balanced partition problem</a>, which is a problem in the realm of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">dynamic programming</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now similar problems have been discussed a lot, but I was unable find an efficient solution for this particular one. The problem is of course that the number of possible combinations to traverse soon grows too large for a brute force search (at least when using recursion). I have a recursive solution that works fine for all but the largest problem sets. I tried to add some optimizations that stop the recursion early, but the performance is still too slow to solve some arrays of the maximum length (30) within the 5 second maximum allowed by CodeFu. Any suggestions for how to improve or rewrite the code would be very welcome.

Here are the two methods that I have for the major and minor array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void majorDiagonal(int[][] board)\n    {\n        byte count = 0;\n\n        for(int row = board.length - 1, offsetNumber = board.length - 1; row > 0; row--, offsetNumber--)\n    \t   for(int column = board.length - 1; column > 0; column--)\n    \t\t   if(board[row][offsetNumber] == 0) count++;\n\n        if(count == 8) System.out.println(\"All zeroes on the major diagonal\");\n    }\n\npublic static void minorDiagonal(int[][] board)\n    {\n        byte count = 0;\n\n        for(int row = board.length - 1, offsetNumber = 0; row > 0; row--, offsetNumber++)\n    \t   for(int column = board.length - 1; column > 0; column--)\n    \t\t   if(board[row][offsetNumber] == 0) count++;\n\n        if(count == 8) System.out.println(\"All zeroes on the minor diagonal\");\n    }</code></pre>\n\n<p>An interesting error that I encountered when I tried to find the major diagonal by counting up in the for loop, ie:\n<pre>for(int row = 0; row&lt; board.length; row++)\n    \tfor(int column = 0; column &lt; board.length; column++)\n    \t\tif(board[row][row] == 0) count++;</pre>The code wouldn't work, but if the diagonal had all 1's and a single 0, it would print \"All zeros on the major diagonal\" even though the variable, count, wasn't eight.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this makes sense, thanks for any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","multidimensional-array","foreach"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13172285,"title":"PHP: checking array to see if values match, display those values","body":"<p>I am generating an array from a while loop, and I would like to eventually use this array to display data.</p>\n\n<pre><code>while($row = $database-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)\n{\n\n     $value_1 = $row['value_1'];\n     $value_2 = $row['value_2'];\n\n     $data[] = array(\"value_1\"=&gt;$value_1,\"value_2\"=&gt;$value_2);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so the $data[] would display using <code>print_r</code> I get something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array\n(\n    [0] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [value_1] =&gt; Hello World\n            [value_2] =&gt; venus\n        )\n\n    [1] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [value_1] =&gt; Hello World\n            [value_2] =&gt; pluto\n        )\n\n    [2] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [value_1] =&gt; Hello Moon\n            [value_2] =&gt; Halloween\n        )\n\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is, how would I do a foreach loop or display such a way where if I wanted to get all data, but consolidate the same values?</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ex:\n\nHello World to venus pluto\nHello Moon to Halloween\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know those sentences doesn't make sense, but as you can see Hello World would be consolidated and I would need to add an \" to\" in between <code>value_1</code> and <code>value_2</code></p>\n\n<p>Hope my question is understandable.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","arrays","multidimensional-array","arraylist"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13172002,"title":"Getting the first element in a string array which is inside a arraylist.

I may be completely wrong if so please correct me .</code></p>\n\n<p>My second intuition is:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose we have an array of elements as follows : 4,9,7,3,2,1,8,12</p>\n\n<p>we calculate above condition <code>i&lt;j , a[i]&gt;a[j]</code>  for element 4 ,as i=0 points to 4 ,the possible values for j are 3,4,5 .since a[0]>a[3],a[0]>a[4],a[0]>a[5] ,so my total no of (i,j) pairs for now is 3 .\n Next time when I increment i(index) to 1,the possibles values of j are 2,3,4,5,6 . But we should use the fact that when i=0 (when a[i]=4) we have computed 3 elements less than a[i=0] which is in turn less than a[i=1] , so  i will not compare 9 with 3,2,1 (To remove unnecessary computations ).If we can remove unnecessary computations then we can reduce complexity to something less than O(N^2) or else no solution less than O(N^2) exists.But if solution exists then how do we do that.I tried making graph but my efforts are futile .</p>\n\n<p>Approach 1)<code>In-order to obtain O(nlogn) complexity I think we need to tweak around quick sort or merge sort to get solution but problem here is, if we sort the array we loose the actual positions of elements.</code>  </p>\n\n<p>Approach     <code>2)In-order to get solution in O(NlogN) time I think using tree we may get the optimised sollution .

On a different page on the site, I want the users to be able to see all the emails they sent, but I want them to see the names of who they sent it to, rather than the email addresses.  This is why I need both the names and the emails.  I need emails for the mail function, and names to be displayed back to the user.

When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88.

They are working on objects that are on the page from the beginning.<br/>\nHere is what i have:<br/></p>\n\n<pre><code>$(function(){\n    for (var i=0, len=divnames.length; i&lt;len; i++) {\n        if(divnames[i]){\n            (function( ) { // anonymous function to fix closures\n                var index = i; // also needed to fix closures\n                $('#'+divnames[index]).on(\"click\", function() {\n                    objects[index].play();\n                    loadContent(divnames[index]+\".php\");\n                });\n            })( ); // direct function execution to fix closures\n        }\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As stated above, closure problem is fixed by the two commented lines, leaving them away will only ever apply the last execution of the for-loop. As it is now, that works.<br/>\nBut what doesnt work, is that the click function should also be applied to divs matching the selector, but are not yet loaded.<br/>\nBut that does work if the code with the same functionality is not iterated inside a for loop without the closure-fix, because thats expected .on() behaviour if i understand correctly.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>So how do i get both desired functionalities to work?<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time in advance.</p>\n\n<p>----edit----</p>\n\n<p>Additional information as requested:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var divnames = [];\ndivnames[0] = \"home\";\ndivnames[1] = \"about\";\ndivnames[2] = \"projects\";\n\nfunction SpriteAnim (options) {\nvar timerId = 0; \n    var i = 0;\n    this.status = 0;\nthis.init = function () {\n    var element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n    element.style.width = options.width + \"px\";\n    element.style.height = options.height + \"px\";\n    element.style.backgroundRepeat = \"no-repeat\";\n    element.style.backgroundImage = \"url(\" + options.sprite + \")\";\n};\nthis.showFrame = function (which) {\n    if (which &lt; options.frames) {\n                    i = which;\n        element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n        element.style.backgroundPosition = \"0px -\" + which * options.height + \"px\";\n    }\n};\nthis.play = function () {\n            this.status = 2;\n    timerId = setInterval(function () {\n        if (i &lt; (options.frames - 1)) {\n                            i++;\n            element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);\n            element.style.backgroundPosition = \"0px -\" + i * options.height + \"px\";\n                    } else {\n                        clearInterval(timerId);\n                        this.status = 1;\n                    }\n    }, 100);\n};\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you probably have already guessed, the objects[] array contains 3 SpriteAnim objects in objects[0], objects[1], objects[2].</p>\n\n<pre><code>objects[0] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim1.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim0\"\n});\nobjects[1] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim1.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim1\"\n});\nobjects[2] = new SpriteAnim({\n    width: 7,\n    height: 7,\n    frames: 8,\n    sprite: \"myanim2.png\",\n    elementId: \"anim2\"\n});\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","binary-tree","binary-search-tree"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":1,"question_id":13096540,"title":"Adding an element in an array based Binary Search Tree","body":"<p>So I've stumped on this current problem I'm working on.

The mouseover-part for example is not triggered on div's that are load()ed later on, but very well match the selector</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#'+menu[f][g][h]).\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the alternative solution that i found here on SO, you would remove the comments in the beginning to get that anonymous function, replace all occurences of e.data.** with the appropriate ** only, replace all the .binds with .on and of course remove the { fr:f, gr:g, hr: h} eventData parts. Oh, and remove the comment in the end where the function is directly beeing executed })();<br/><br/>\nAny hint would be great, thanks in advance for your time.</p>\n\n<p>----edit----</p>\n\n<p>Accepted, this is a total mess. Im going to go a different way, thanks for the help.\nYet the logical problem still exists, even in simpler forms, and im really interested in the answer, just to understand what the basic logical problem behind it is.

The game will be top-down 2d and made with XNA 4.0 and C#. You will begin in a randomized area which will essentially be tile based. As such a 2 dimensional array would be one way to accomplish this by holding numerical values which would correspond to a list of textures and that would be how it would draw this randomly created map. The problem is I would kind of only like to create the area around where you start and they could venture in which ever direction they wanted to. This would mean I'd have to populate the map array with more randomized data in the direction they go. I could make a really large array and use the center of it and the rest would be in anticipation of new content to be made, but that just seems very inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose when they start a new game I could have a one time map creation process that would go through and create a large randomly generated map array, but holding all of in memory at all times seems also inefficient. Perhaps if there was a way that I'd only hold parts of that map data in memory at one time and somehow not hold the rest in memory. In the end I only need to have a chunk of the map somewhat close to them in memory so perhaps some of you might have suggestions on good ways to approach this kind of randomized map and dynamic array problem. It wouldn't need to be a dynamic array type of thing if I made it so that it pulled in map data nearby that is needed and then once off the screen and not needed it could somehow get rid of that memory that way I wouldn't have a huge array taking up a bunch of memory.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","2d"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13097149,"title":"constructing a 2D array and assigning","body":"<pre><code>package homework3;\n\npublic class DoubleMatrix\n{\n\n   private double[][] doubMatrix;\n\n   public DoubleMatrix (int row, int col)\n   {\n    if(row &gt; 0 &amp; col &gt; 0)\n    {\n        makeDoubMatrix(1,1);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        row = 1;\n        col = 1;\n    }\n\n}\npublic DoubleMatrix(double[][] tempArray)\n{   \n    int k = tempArray.length;\n    if(tempArray != null)\n    {\n\n\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; tempArray.length;i++)\n        {\n            if(k== tempArray[i].length)\n            {\n\n\n            }\n\n        }   \n     }\n    else\n    {\n        makeDoubMatrix(1,1);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what i was supposed to start my assignment with: \n Write a class called DoubleMatrix in which you declare a 2-dim. array of doubles (I'm calling it doubMatrix) as a private instance variable.

This query should be executed several (possibly tens to hundreds or even thousands) of times per second.

If this is a completely wrong way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks very much!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Taking into consideration what was answered, I was wondering if it would be plausible to use materialized views.  By this I mean having several materialized views (each one for a different parameter value, having the rows where that value is not present).  We the parameter values are, to a certain extent, predictable, so this doesn't seem too far out there as a solution.  This brings another matter into question: Would materialized views help here?  Is there some limitation (either in definition or performance) as to the number of materialized views (or tables) that I can create in a database?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks very much for your help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","arrays","table","checkbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":13079953,"title":"Displaying Checkbox Array and PHP Variable Arrays in HTML Table","body":"<p>and thanks for your interest in my question.</p>\n\n<p>I have an html table that includes 7 columns.

They have been very helpful.\nI've actually run into this situation more than once, and I'd like to give a second example that is unrelated to inheritance.  This is actually a real-world example, and though I've decided my current project is small scale enough to be safe with using vectors based on your answers,  it's a concept that I imagine I'll use on a much larger scale at some point.</p>\n\n<p>In creating an engine for my current Android game project, I found it necessary to create an Imagepoint object that is basically a set of XY coordinates that are used to track significant parts of a sprite image.  Say you have a bone character made up of several bitmaps, it's useful to know where the neck attaches to the torso, the forearm to the bicep, etc.  This xy offset data is used later to calculate the position for various purposes, such as where to position other sprites by using trigonometric functions to find the xy offset given the current angle.</p>\n\n<p>Most sprite objects will need only one image point.  The bicep needs one for the forearm, the forearm needs one for the hand, the neck needs one for the head, etc.  The torsos in my current character models are the exception, and they need several for the shoulders, the legs, the neck, and any removable decorative sprites. </p>\n\n<p>The sprite is the object that contains the imagepoint vectors, there will be no inherited classes, because each : torso, leg, etc is simply an instance of the sprite class, which is strictly a graphical object, containing a pointer to the bitmap, these imagepoints, and assorted position/orientation data, and will not be used for any specialized purposes. If I were to use this concept on a large scale game with massive numbers of instances, where most would require only a single imagepoint, with a few objects requiring several or none, and where there would be no special cases meriting the use of inheritance.

I can't change the structure of the database in any way because we would have to change the ticketsystem to cope with that change and that is not an option. </p>\n\n<p>So with that out of the way...<br>\nBecause there is no seperate field available we add a chapter number to the title of every item to have a sort of index. </p>\n\n<p>So you'd get something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 start\n1.1 some subchapter\n2 new chapter\n3 another chapter\n3.1 sub of chapter\n3.1.1 sub sub chapter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>etc.. </p>\n\n<p>Offcourse with a nifty regex it's easy to extra the chapter part from the string. But the next step would be to make it easy to find the corresponding subchapters based on the parent chapter. Easiest way to make this searchable without a database would be a multidimensional array, right? </p>\n\n<p>So you would get this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>array( 3 =&gt; array( \n              'item' =&gt; 'data', 1 =&gt; array('item', 2 = array() ) ) )  etc...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I've done now is to create an array of chapter indexes ( [3,1,1] in the case of 3.1.1  ) and because I know the there are always between 1 and 3 items in this array I made a switch based on the array length and then did this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array[$index[0]][$index[1]]['item'] = $content;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I feel this is a very dirty and unlfexible way of doing this.

So that's working. </p>\n\n<p>What I basicly build is a form that uses the array of indexes to build a list of checkboxes for each chapter or chapterpart. But I don't want to search through the array and compare keys to find subchapters. So if I'd choose 3.1 I'd check 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and because the key starts with 3.1 I'd know to print it.</p>\n\n<p>Faster would be to be able to do this: </p>\n\n<p>Choose 3.1.1  =>  return $chapters[3][1][1]['item']</p>\n\n<p>But that's only possible when I can build the initial array in that form.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","arrays","mpi"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13027607,"title":"MPI_Gather on 2D array","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9269399/sending-blocks-of-2d-array-in-c-using-mpi\">sending blocks of 2D array in C using MPI</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am learning MPI and I came across this MPI_Gather.

Java","body":"<p>I cannot figure out how to write Java code in order for it to take an input array and then do the calculations, here is the full question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Write a method <code>calculateLeadingDigitProportions</code> which takes as input\n  a <code>double[]</code> numbers and returns a <code>double[]</code>. The method should\n  analyze the array numbers and return an array representing for each\n  digit, the proportion of times it occurred as a leading digit. In the\n  produced array, the value at the 0th index should represent the\n  proportion of times that a 0 was a leading digit (only occurs when the\n  number is 0 after truncation to an int), the value at the 1st index\n  would contain the proportion of times that a 1 was a leading digit,\n  and so on, up until the 9th index. For example, if numbers contains:\n  <code>{ 100, 200.1,\n  9.3, 10}</code> then 1 occurs as a leading digit 50 % of the time, 2 occurs 25% of the time, and 9 occurs 25 % of the time, so your produced array\n  should contain: <code>{0, .5, .25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, .25}</code> You may use the\n  method <code>calculateLeadingDigit</code> to do this, but note that that method\n  expects as input an <code>int</code>, and so you will need to cast or perform a\n  conversion in some other way. Note that if the number is less than 1\n  but greater than 0 it is fine to call the leading digit 0 after a\n  truncation. </p>\n  \n  <p>Hint: This method is fairly involved. You may find it useful to write\n  a helper method called, for example, <code>countLeadingDigits</code> which\n  returns an array of counts for each digit and only then calculate the\n  percentages</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["c","arrays","types"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":13021633,"title":"Storing integer in the array of char","body":"<p>I've been reading this thread <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1522994/store-an-int-in-a-char-array\">Store an int in a char array?</a></p>\n\n<p>And I need to store the int in the array of chars.</p>\n\n<p>So I read the previous thread and I tried to make my own demo.

But I don't get why <code>c[200:][200:][200:]</code> returns this kind of answer. </p>\n\n<p>Here's two examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>In [68]: c.shape\nOut[68]: (448, 433, 446)\n\nIn [63]: c[100:][100:][100:]\nOut[63]: \narray([[[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]],\n\n       [[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]],\n\n       [[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]],\n\n       ..., \n       [[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]],\n\n       [[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]],\n\n       [[ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        ..., \n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n        [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]]])\n\nIn [67]: c[200:][200:][200:]\nOut[67]: array([], shape=(0, 433, 446), dtype=float64)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","arrays","nsmutablearray"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2994,"score":0,"question_id":4584316,"title":"NSMutableArray in AppDelegate addObject from IBAction","body":"<p>I've been trying to add a simple bookmarks facility to my app for my dissertation at uni.

I think it would be most helpful if someone could show me some well-commented code that accomplishes my goal so I can work backwards and apply it myself.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":12967267,"title":"Grouping consecutive dates in an array together in PHP","body":"<p>I have the following dates in an array (dates will not always be these dates)</p>\n\n<pre><code>[0] 2012-10-18\n[1] 2012-10-19\n[2] 2012-10-20\n[3] 2012-10-23\n[4] 2012-10-24\n[5] 2012-10-29\n[6] 2012-10-30\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to group consecutive dates together so the output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-10-18 to 2012-10-20\n2012-10-23 to 2012-10-24\n2012-10-29 to 2012-10-30\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How would I do this in PHP?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","arrays","table"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":12912582,"title":"Array data to display in table cells where col and row are given in array","body":"<p>I have a array </p>\n\n<pre><code>Array ( \n    Array ( \n        [id] =&gt; 1 ,\n        [schedule_id] =&gt; 4 ,\n        [subject] =&gt; Subject 1 ,\n        [classroom] =&gt; 1 ,\n        [time] =&gt; 08:00:00 ,\n        [col] =&gt; 1 ,\n        [row] =&gt; 1 \n    ), \n    Array ( \n        [id] =&gt; 2 ,\n        [schedule_id] =&gt; 4 ,\n        [subject] =&gt; Subject 2 ,\n        [classroom] =&gt; 1 ,\n        [time] =&gt; 08:00:00 ,\n        [col] =&gt; 2 ,\n        [row] =&gt; 1 \n    ), \n    Array ( \n        [id] =&gt; 3 ,\n        [schedule_id] =&gt; 4 ,\n        [subject] =&gt; Subject 3 ,\n        [classroom] =&gt; 2 ,\n        [time] =&gt; 09:00:00 ,\n        [col] =&gt; 1 ,\n        [row] =&gt; 2 \n    ), \n    Array ( \n        [id] =&gt; 4 ,\n        [schedule_id] =&gt; 4 ,\n        [subject] =&gt; Subject 4 ,\n        [classroom] =&gt; 2 ,\n        [time] =&gt; 09:00:00 ,\n        [col] =&gt; 2 ,\n        [row] =&gt; 2 \n    ) \n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to display it in table format according to col and row value</p>\n\n<pre><code>col 1 &amp; row 1           col 2 $ row 1   \n1st array data          2nd array data\nSubject, room, time     Subject, room, time\n1,  1,  08:00           2,  1,  08:00\n\ncol 1 $ row 2           col 2 $ row 2   \n3rd array data          4th array data\nSubject, room, time     Subject, room, time\n3,  2,  09:00           4,  2,  08:00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am new to arrays and need you support to sort this table.

I feel so dumb. I needed this though in order to finally get my answer.

The idea is simple: one block for one row (so 1D grid and the number of blocks equals the number of rows) and N threads for each row. The row number is 1920 and column number is 1088. So there are 1920 blocks.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is: when N (the number of threads in one block) is 64, 128 or 256, everything works (at least looks like working) fine. However, when N was 512 (I am using GTX570 with CUDA computation capability 2.0 and the maximum size for each dimension of one block is 1024), the errors happened.</p>\n\n<p>The errors are: The elements (each one is a 4-byte floating number) in a row in the global memory from position 256 to 287 (index starts at 0, error strip length is 32 elements, 128 bits) is 0 rather than 123. It looks like \"123 123 123 ... 0 0 0 0 0... 0 123 123 ...\". I checked the line above (1*) and those elements were 123 in \"sharedOutputArray\" and when the element (for example tid==270) was read in (1*), \"temp\" showed 0. I tried to see \"tid==255\" and \"tid==288\" and the element was 123 (corrent). This type of error happened in almost all 1920 rows.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to \"synchronize\" (maybe already over-synchronized) the threads but it did not work. What makes me confused is why 64,128 or 256 threads worked fine but 512 did not work. I know using 512 threads may not be optimized for the performance and I just would like to know where I made the mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","arrays","edittext","sharedpreferences","resource-id"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":12965375,"title":"setting edittext fields via arrays","body":"<p>I have an activity that works as an edit screen.

Why?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> In the Matlab documentation for <code>bsxfun</code>, the following example is provided:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A = magic(5);\nA = bsxfun(@minus, A, mean(A))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course we could do the same operation using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A = A - (ones(size(A, 1), 1) * mean(A));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in fact a simple speed test demonstrates the second method is about 20% faster. So why use the first method? I'm guessing there are some circumstances where using <code>bsxfun</code> will be much faster than the \"manual\" approach. I'd be really interested in seeing an example of such a situation and an explanation as to why it is faster.</p>\n\n<p>Also, one final element to this question, again from the Matlab documentation for <code>bsxfun</code>: \"C = bsxfun(fun,A,B) applies the element-by-element binary operation specified by the function handle fun to arrays A and B, with singleton expansion enabled.\". What does the phrase \"with singleton expansion enabled\" mean?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've given all 3 answers a +1 as I think each of them contributes something useful.

A user can respond to any survey any number of times. A survey can have any number of questions.</p>\n\n<p>Each set of responses is identified by a column <code>unique_uid</code>, so that the 10 rows for 10 questions all have that same <code>unique_uid</code> (an 18-24 digit string). Each response is stored as a row in table <code>scores</code>. A user might have an account in table <code>accounts</code>, or they may have completed the survey as a guest without registering.</p>\n\n<p>I have two queries built to extract:</p>\n\n<p>(first) a DISTINCT collection of <code>unique_uid</code>s and the account's <code>name_first</code> and <code>name_last</code> (if they exist). If the user responded without an account, they are <code>NULL</code>. The results are ordered ASC on <code>name_last</code>, then ASC on <code>name_first</code>. All guests (<code>NULL</code>) are ordered first, followed by all accounts with names.</p>\n\n<p>(secondly) a query to collect all responses to the survey, then pair them with their owner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> For some reason, my array data is not staying in the order that MySQL returns it. I have two or three accounts with <code>name_first</code> and <code>name_last</code> that are getting interspersed amongst the <code>NULL</code> accounts. </p>\n\n<p>Given that I ordered ascending on name_last then name_first, and the data is coming back from MySQL in that order, and the PHP array is generated in that order, I can't find out why it's losing order. Does PHP re-structure array data based on which key was touched last? </p>\n\n<p>I thought that perhaps my associative keys were being recast as indexed, so I prepended the letter \"a\" to each <code>unique_uid</code>, but that did not help.</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any insight you may have, thanks...</p>\n\n<p>*<strong>*EDIT :</strong> I was able to use <code>usort()</code> (code at the bottom of this post) to get the data back in order.

However, I do not know how to output the index numbers rather than the values as currently is the case and append them to a list or input them into an array.</p>\n\n<pre><code>for n in range(0, len(sign_slope)):\n    if sign_slope[n] &lt; 0 and sign_slope[n - 1] &gt; 0:\n        print sign_slope[n - 1]\n    else:\n        print 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks is advance,</p>\n\n<p>Kane</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","arrays","json","json-encode"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":12952814,"title":"json_encode - if only one data, then no array","body":"<p>i have a xml file, and encode it to json!</p>\n\n<p>XML</p>\n\n<p>assets id with only 1 asset</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;assets id=\"mobile-top-WS\"&gt;-\n &lt;asset&gt;\n  &lt;assetId&gt;5571&lt;/assetId&gt;\n  &lt;eventId&gt;8194&lt;/eventId&gt;\n  &lt;eventDate&gt;2012-02-01&lt;/eventDate&gt;\n  &lt;eventTime&gt;19:00:00&lt;/eventTime&gt;\n  &lt;endDate/&gt;&lt;endTime/&gt;\n &lt;/asset&gt;\n&lt;/assets&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>assets id with 2 assets</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;assets id=\"mobile-top-ES\"&gt;-\n &lt;asset&gt;\n  &lt;assetId&gt;5371&lt;/assetId&gt;\n  &lt;eventId&gt;8594&lt;/eventId&gt;\n  &lt;eventDate&gt;2012-02-01&lt;/eventDate&gt;\n  &lt;eventTime&gt;19:00:00&lt;/eventTime&gt;\n  &lt;endDate/&gt;&lt;endTime/&gt;\n &lt;/asset&gt;\n &lt;asset&gt;\n  &lt;assetId&gt;53471&lt;/assetId&gt;\n  &lt;eventId&gt;854564&lt;/eventId&gt;\n  &lt;eventDate&gt;2012-02-01&lt;/eventDate&gt;\n  &lt;eventTime&gt;19:00:00&lt;/eventTime&gt;\n  &lt;endDate/&gt;&lt;endTime/&gt;\n &lt;/asset&gt;\n&lt;/assets&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>JSON</p>\n\n<p>assets id with only 1 asset</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"@attributes\":{\"id\":\"mobile-top-WS\"},\"asset\":{\"assetId\":\"5571\",\"eventId\":\"8194\",\"eventDate\":\"2012-02-01\",\"eventTime\":\"19:00:00\",\"endDate\":{}........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>assets id with 2 assets</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"@attributes\":{\"id\":\"mobile-top-EL\"},\"asset\":[{\"assetId\":\"3434\",\"eventId\":\"5886\",\"eventDate\":\"0000-00-00\",\"eventTime\":\"00:00:00\",\"endDate\":{}..........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see in the \"assets ID with 2 assets it creates an array --> [ which is not used when only 1 data is available.

I'd be happy to chalk it up to the ajax request screwing it up somehow, but then why does the first log perform as expected?</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","arrays","enumeration"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":4,"question_id":12927951,"title":"array indexing (converting to integer) with scoped enumeration","body":"<p>C++11 scoped enumerators (<code>enum class</code> syntax) do not convert to integers so they cannot be used directly as array indexes.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way to get the benefit of scoping when using them in this fashion?</p>\n\n<p>I've provided a couple answers, but please add more ideas!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","arrays","string","file-io"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":12948777,"title":"Why does my data stream begin repeating after 20 or 30 lines?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8734116/eof-loop-not-working\">.eof() loop not working</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have a fairly simple C++ program that I'm trying to get to read text files with a few columns of data, and reformat those lines and output them into a different text file. (The reformatting basically just involves taking certain lines, leaving out others, and appending a bit of extra data to the end of each line). It seems to work perfectly well, but on several different data files it seems to get hung up on one line in particular and start outputting that one line indefinitely- I have to manually stop the process. I think it may have to do with the way that the 'fileSize' variable is stored, (if you look at the output, you can see that the fileSize that is repeated is not correct for that line, and that it corresponds with the line before it started repeating). Other than that I have no idea what to look for or fix, and I've been wrestling with this issue for several days. I'll include the code and the output of running it. Any ideas or suggestions would be very much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\n#include &lt;assert.h&gt;\n#include &lt;iomanip&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) { \n  //cout &lt;&lt; \"argc = \" &lt;&lt; argc &lt;&lt; endl; \n  //for(int i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++) \n  //  cout &lt;&lt; \"argv[\" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; \"] = \" &lt;&lt; argv[i] &lt;&lt; endl; \n\n  ifstream inFile;\n  ofstream outFile;\n\n  int numReq, fileSize;\n  string lang, dash, langBefore, langAfter;\n  string beforeDash, afterDash, beforeNumReq, afterNumReq;\n  string beforeFileSize, afterFileSize;\n\n  char fileName[60];\n  char outfileName[60];\n  char confirm[10];\n  char confirm2[10];\n  int character;\n  char year[5];\n  char month[3]; \n  char day[3];\n  char hour[3];\n\n  for (int a = 0;a &lt; 60; a++){\n    fileName[a] = argv[1][a];\n  }\n\n  //fileName = argv[1];\n\n\n  year[0] = fileName[14];\n  year[1] = fileName[15];\n  year[2] = fileName[16];\n  year[3] = fileName[17];\n  year[4] = '\\0';\n\n  month[0] = fileName[18];\n  month[1] = fileName[19];\n  month[2] = '\\0';\n\n  day[0] = fileName[20];\n  day[1] = fileName[21];\n  day[2] = '\\0';\n\n  hour[0] = fileName[23];\n  hour[1] = fileName[24];\n  hour[2] = '\\0';\n\n  //cout &lt;&lt; \"fileName = \"&lt;&lt;fileName&lt;&lt;\"?\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n  //cin &gt;&gt;confirm;\n\n\n  //cout &lt;&lt; \"So, we have: year = \"&lt;&lt;year&lt;&lt;\", month = \"&lt;&lt;month&lt;&lt;\", day = \"&lt;&lt;day\n  //     &lt;&lt;\", and hour = \"&lt;&lt;hour&lt;&lt;\"?\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n\n  inFile.open(fileName);\n  assert (!inFile.fail());\n\n  for (int i=0;i&lt;30;i++){  \n    outfileName[i] = fileName[i];\n  }\n  outfileName[29] = '_';\n  outfileName[30] = 'O';\n  outfileName[31] = 'U';\n  outfileName[32] = 'T';\n  outfileName[33] = 'P';\n  outfileName[34] = 'U';\n  outfileName[35] = 'T';\n  outfileName[36] = 'p';\n  outfileName[37] = 'r';\n  outfileName[38] = '.';\n  outfileName[39] = 't';\n  outfileName[40] = 'x';\n  outfileName[41] = 't';\n  outfileName[42] = '\\0';\n\n\n\n  outFile.open(outfileName);\n  //Now, add the commands to manipulate the data:\n\n  outFile &lt;&lt; fixed &lt;&lt; showpoint; \n  outFile &lt;&lt; setprecision(2);    \n\n  cout &lt;&lt; \"Processing data from \" &lt;&lt; fileName &lt;&lt;\" to \"&lt;&lt;outfileName&lt;&lt;\".\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n\n  inFile &gt;&gt; lang;\n\n  cout &lt;&lt; \"about to begin the 'while' statement.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\n  while (!inFile.eof() ){\n    string dot (\".\");\n    size_t found;\n    found = lang.find(dot); \n\n\n    beforeDash = dash;\n    beforeNumReq = numReq;\n    beforeFileSize = fileSize;\n\n    if (found == string::npos){ //should this be != or == ?\n\n      outFile &lt;&lt; lang &lt;&lt; \" \";\n\n      //*see footnote*\n\n      inFile &gt;&gt; dash &gt;&gt; numReq &gt;&gt; fileSize;\n      outFile &lt;&lt; numReq &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; fileSize &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; month\n          &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; hour &lt;&lt; endl;\n      cout &lt;&lt;\"Read: \"&lt;&lt;lang&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;dash&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;numReq&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;fileSize&lt;&lt;\".\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n      afterDash = dash;\n      afterNumReq = numReq;\n      afterFileSize = fileSize;      \n    }\n    else{\n      inFile &gt;&gt; dash &gt;&gt; numReq &gt;&gt; fileSize;\n\n      cout &lt;&lt;\"Read: \"&lt;&lt;lang&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;dash&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;numReq&lt;&lt;\" \"&lt;&lt;fileSize&lt;&lt;\".\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n\n      afterDash = dash;\n      afterNumReq = numReq;\n      afterFileSize = fileSize;\n\n      //      if (beforeFileSize == afterFileSize){ \n      //    cout &lt;&lt;\"Why oh why is the afterFileSize = &gt;&gt;\" &lt;&lt; \"&lt;&lt;?\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n      //    cin &gt;&gt; confirm;\n      //       }  \n    }\n\n\n    langBefore = lang;\n    inFile &gt;&gt; lang;\n    langAfter = lang;\n\n    //if (langBefore == langAfter)\n    //  cin &gt;&gt;confirm;\n\n\n  }\n\n  //cout &lt;&lt; \"after the 'while' statement\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\n  inFile.close();\n  //assert(!inFile.fail());\n  outFile.close();      \n\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...

The fact that we do not know whether function f2 has an integer array AND even if it did, we do not know whether or not that function chose to store the array on the stack, makes me assume D is the correct answer.  It is correct to assume that just because you have a function doesn't mean you will allocate space on the stack for whatever it might contain, correct?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12947855,"title":"Adding input to an array or object one-by-one using a form in Javascript","body":"<p>I want to know what code to use to create a form where the user can input something and click submit (or a button) and the data will be stored in an array (or JSON object) , then they can do it again and the previous data will be \"pushed\" hence the user can keep adding to it.

I am trying to reach an answer not have a discussion as per the spirit of this website. What I'm asking is language agnostic but you may draw on your knowledge of what arrays are/do in various languages that you've used.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ways of thinking about this question:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you're designing a new programming language and you decide to implement arrays in it; what does that mean they do? What will the properties and capabilities of those things be. If it depends on the type of language, how so?</li>\n<li>What makes an array an array?</li>\n<li>When is an array not an array? When it is, for example, a list, vector, table, map, or collection?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's possible there isn't one precise definition of what an array is, if that is the case then are there any standard or near-standard assumptions or what an array is? Are there any common areas at least? Maybe there are several definitions, if that is the case I'm looking for the most precision in each of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Language examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Correct me if I'm wrong on any of these).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>C arrays are contiguous blocks of memory of a single type that can be traversed using pointer arithmetic or accessed at a specific offset point. They have a fixed size.</li>\n<li>Arrays in JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP, have a variable size and can store an object/scalar of any type they can also grow or have elements removed from them.</li>\n<li>PHP arrays come in two types: numeric and associative. Associative arrays have elements that are stored and retrieved with string keys. Numeric arrays have elements that are stored and retrieved with integers. Interestingly if you have: <code>$eg = array('a', 'b', 'c')</code> and you <code>unset($eg[1])</code> you still retrieve <code>'c'</code> with <code>$eg[2]</code>, only now <code>$eg[1]</code> is undefined. (You can call <code>array_values()</code> to re-index the array). You can also mix string and integer keys.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this stage of sort of suspecting that C arrays are the only true array here and that strictly-speaking for an array to be an array it has to have all the characteristics I mention in that first bullet point. If that's the case then — again these are suspicions that I'm looking to have confirmed or rejected — arrays in JS and Ruby are actually vectors, and PHP arrays are probably tables of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>Final note: I've made this community wiki so if answers need to be edited a few times in lieu of comments, go ahead and do that.

Thanks again.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","database","arrays","io","rrd"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":12722818,"title":"Saving 2D Arrays (high frequency) - structure needed","body":"<p>I´m searching for a solution to store 2D (int) Arrays to local disc - doesn´t sound very hard, but the frequency and the size of the arrays keep bothering me.</p>\n\n<p>The array size is [1400][400] and at peak times, we´re getting every 50ms an array.</p>\n\n<p>How much do we need to store?
