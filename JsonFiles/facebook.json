If you are to link me to a tutorial, could you please link me directly to the final product, as I learn best being thrown in at the deep end so to speak, which is how I learnt other languages, reading through it and whatnot seeing what makes what tick so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>Best Regards,\nTim</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","class"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":11,"score":-1,"question_id":13254885,"title":"\"Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class FacebookApiException","body":"<p>I have installed the instabuilder plug in and somehow the SEO Facebook C. plugin is conflicting with it.</p>\n\n<p>Only when the <code>SEO Facebook C.</code> plugin is active accessing this page: <a href=\"http://www.jmuller777.com/blog/?mode=facebook_tab\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jmuller777.com/blog/?mode=facebook_tab</a> gives me the fallowing error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class FacebookApiException in\n  /home/denrrou/public_html/jmuller777.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/InstaBuilder/inc/facebook/base_facebook.php\n  on line 107\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have read that it should be a class issue, but i cant figure out where to fix it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","facebook-graph-api"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13257720,"title":"Testing the inviting of users to an event: event_id/invited/user_id","body":"<p>I'm working on testing some code to invite a user to an event when they click a button.

This is being phased out on November 7, by which time one needs to convert all such pages to \"real\" facebook pages following the procedure Facebook documents here:</p>\n\n<p>developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/migration/</p>\n\n<p>Our nonprofit organization operates web pages (and Facebook pages) for just over 200 breed-specific animal rescue groups, all of which have Facebook like buttons on each web page.  I've successfully migrated over about 20 of these pages using the procedure designated in the page above.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm having is that at some point recently, Facebook stopped creating the Admin pages when a page admin likes a web page.  This means, for about 80% or so of the rescue pages we have (many with 1000's of likes), I have no way to \"migrate\" them because there is no page to migrate.</p>\n\n<p>All of these pages have identical code as the pages I was able to migrate, the only difference is I never went, and as page Admin, clicked the Like button on any of these pages, so Facebook never created any page which I can use for the migration process.  (I would have done this months ago had I known Facebook was phasing out this ability, but I don't think it was ever announced.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know when Facebook discontinued creating Admin pages for web pages with Like buttons, but having discontinued it before the November 7 actual migration deadline, we have no way now to access the likes from many of our web pages to migrate them over to our actual Facebook pages.</p>\n\n<p>This might be better illustrated by examples.  We operate a page for Pit Bull Rescue here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pitbull.rescueme.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pitbull.rescueme.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>I successfully migrated the \"Likes\" from that page to our actual Facebook page here using the documentation on Facebook's migration page:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pitbull.rescueme.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.facebook.com/pitbull.rescueme.org</a></p>\n\n<p>(Note the \"Like\" count on the Facebook on the web page is higher, because Facebook counts certain shares on a page, that don't count as actual likes on a Facebook page.)</p>\n\n<p>But here's a page with the problem: australianshepherd.rescueme.org</p>\n\n<p>It has 383 Likes but there is no way for me to migrate those likes over because there is no associated page in my Facebook account to migrate.  I created a Facebook page to merge these likes into ( www.facebook.com/australianshepherd.rescueme.org ) but don't know how to get them there.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I would have just clicked the Like button on the WEB page itself, and an Admin page would have been created.  Apparently Facebook discontinued that ability at some point long before the November 7 migration deadline, so I have no idea how I can fix this.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine (or hope) there is some parameter perhaps I can switch in some app settings panel to help with this, but I can't find any way to do it.  Any suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>I've been told I need to ask someone at Facebook to manually transfer \"Likes\" from such pages over to our actual Facebook pages, but have not been able to reach someone to do this.  If this is the necessary step, can someone from Facebook please contact me privately, or post here how to get that type of assistance.</p>\n\n<p>If this was just a few hundred likes it wouldn't be a big deal, but cumulatively I believe we have well over 100,000 fans we will lose if we can't fix this. The hundreds of volunteers running all these rescue group web pages who spent many hours each week over the past year building up our fan base, aren't going to be pleased about learning all their efforts will be lost.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be very, very appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>Jeff Gold</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","facebook","ios6"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6,"score":1,"question_id":13236778,"title":"Facebook in iOS6.0 use SLRequest to upload a photo failed anyway","body":"<p>Here Comes my Objc code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ACAccountStore *facebookaccount = [[ACAccountStore alloc] init];\nACAccountType *facebookaccountType = [facebookaccount accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifier: ACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook];\n// Specify App ID and permissions\nNSDictionary *options = @{ ACFacebookAppIdKey: @\"1234567899876543\", ACFacebookPermissionsKey: @[@\"publish_stream\"], ACFacebookAudienceKey: ACFacebookAudienceFriends };\n[facebookaccount requestAccessToAccountsWithType:facebookaccountType options:options completion:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {\n    if(granted) {\n        NSArray *accountsArray = [facebookaccount accountsWithAccountType:facebookaccountType];\n        if ([accountsArray count] &gt; 0) {\n            ACAccount *facebookAccount = [accountsArray objectAtIndex:0];\n\n            NSString *sendmessage = @\"Face\";\n            NSData *myImageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(imageSource);\n\n            SLRequest *facebookRequest = [SLRequest requestForServiceType:SLServiceTypeFacebook requestMethod:SLRequestMethodPOST URL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://graph.facebook.com/me/photos\"] parameters:nil];\n\n            [facebookRequest addMultipartData:myImageData withName:@\"source\" type:@\"multipart/form-data\" filename:nil];\n            [facebookRequest addMultipartData:[sendmessage dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] withName:@\"message\" type:@\"multipart/form-data\" filename:nil];\n\n            [facebookRequest setAccount:facebookAccount];\n\n            [facebookRequest performRequestWithHandler:^(NSData* responseData, NSHTTPURLResponse* urlResponse, NSError* error) {\n                if (error == nil) {\n                    NSLog(@\"responedata:%@\", [[NSString alloc] initWithData:responseData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]);\n                }else{\n                    NSLog(@\"%@\",error.description);\n                }\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"error description : %@\",[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\", error.localizedDescription]);\n    }\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally I get these respone data:</p>\n\n<p>responedata:{\"error\":{\"message\":\"(#324) Requires upload file\",\"type\":\"OAuthException\",\"code\":324}}</p>\n\n<p>Help me please!!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","facebook"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3875,"score":0,"question_id":5799750,"title":"Share photo on Facebook for android","body":"<p>My application's objective is to take a photo using camera activity and save this photo in android internal storage and then allow the user to share this photo in Facebook as wall post, my problem is I couldn't find any source that show/explain how to share photo in FB and I am totally new with Facebook API</p>\n\n<p>Any help PLZ!</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","caching","facebook-like"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":428,"score":1,"question_id":7483935,"title":"How to refresh the cached title of a page Liked on Facebook?","body":"<p>I have a couple of embedded YouTube videos which I have added Like buttons for.

One of the core features of the application is that users can share app specific URLs to Facebook and Twitter etc so that their friends can follow the shared URLs which will open up either the HTML5 version of my app in their browser OR MOST IMPORTANTLY if they are on Android and they have my native Android app installed they are PROMPTED TO OPEN IN MY APP.</p>\n\n<p>This is a rather long complicated issue so to simplify I'll use some certain terms consistently through-out this post:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"MyApp user\" a Android device user who DOES have my native Android app installed</li>\n<li>\"non-MyApp user\" a Android device user who DOES NOT have my native Android app installed</li>\n<li>\"stock browser user\" a stock Android user who uses a stock browser </li>\n<li>\"non-stock browser user\" a Android user who uses a non-stock browser (note the Samsung Galaxy SII stock \"Internet\" app is considered non-stock)</li>\n<li>\"choose app dialog\" on Android the OS dialog that appears asking the user what application they want to open the action/intent/url/document with and if they want to default to use this application always</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My AndroidManifest.xml contains the following...</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;\n  &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /&gt;\n  &lt;data android:scheme=\"http\" android:host=\"myapp.com\" android:pathPrefix=\"/\" /&gt;\n&lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When tested this WORKS PERFECTLY in any normal scenario.

Great, I've definitely configured my AndroidManifest.xml correctly.</p>\n\n<p>However things do NOT ALWAYS WORK in the critical Facebook sharing scenerio.  It does not always work because both Facebook's native Android app and Facebook's mobile website (http://m.facebook.com) DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY to the shared URLs but instead link via a Facebook redirect page.  For example if <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a> is shared, Facebook will ultimately deliver the following URL:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://m.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.com%2Fsharedpage&amp;h=EAQGpLtuF&amp;enc=AZMXYZg7XwQ39zlWkKSGnLw62lEbtbMeWFmRwRZINoOcg0UgZe3fUVPgqQzV1nuTipSVnquV3a3ovqu7HQFUf3bb3ZJ1gYG8dEOJXzPf6RJGflf9_x8w-6CCXu8G2VZqgfD7lx6EbLTSKLnF56_o5khHybycPUlhpdfLsk6M9muer4jMOmPK6_kfjTq2gvnYNNpStcF0ilJD6nacPqx_1xsdYkUMpKYWbJfSo7qqv1S5xT5KRaLPxl8zmAkYc0FhwyTdn-tUGwRBbbdM4QCd2Z75Tb_VeJG3LvbDwFAbp6G3kH3LOSxVtTd5MST4pUW8xmhNeTUVBVXV16OD27QcsSWOlEfL72fxn11PDE5s4WWsXMnwhDJLUAWOAna7lziBnWzjZdlQK_amI9nhcegaOLDLNFCp125rZS3jxFXf7gtF9g0BsmnPZ2Gjxkc6UgQXhEYldllq9nwpShGbnZDlSg0_&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.com%2Fsharedpage&amp;h=EAQGpLtuF&amp;enc=AZMXYZg7XwQ39zlWkKSGnLw62lEbtbMeWFmRwRZINoOcg0UgZe3fUVPgqQzV1nuTipSVnquV3a3ovqu7HQFUf3bb3ZJ1gYG8dEOJXzPf6RJGflf9_x8w-6CCXu8G2VZqgfD7lx6EbLTSKLnF56_o5khHybycPUlhpdfLsk6M9muer4jMOmPK6_kfjTq2gvnYNNpStcF0ilJD6nacPqx_1xsdYkUMpKYWbJfSo7qqv1S5xT5KRaLPxl8zmAkYc0FhwyTdn-tUGwRBbbdM4QCd2Z75Tb_VeJG3LvbDwFAbp6G3kH3LOSxVtTd5MST4pUW8xmhNeTUVBVXV16OD27QcsSWOlEfL72fxn11PDE5s4WWsXMnwhDJLUAWOAna7lziBnWzjZdlQK_amI9nhcegaOLDLNFCp125rZS3jxFXf7gtF9g0BsmnPZ2Gjxkc6UgQXhEYldllq9nwpShGbnZDlSg0_&amp;s=1</a></p>\n\n<p>If a \"MyApp user\" follows one of these Facebook links one of two things might happen depending on the browser they are using...</p>\n\n<p><strong>MyApp Stock Browser User:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the user has stock Android installed and uses the stock Android browser then things work FINE because the following events occur...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intent fires for the FB l.php URL</li>\n<li>FB URL gets opened in the ANDROID STOCK BROWSER</li>\n<li>The FB l.php is loaded and initiates the REDIRECT to <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a> </li>\n<li><strong>Intent fires for the <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a> URL</strong></li>\n<li>\"choose app dialog\" prompts user to open in MY NATIVE APP or in browser</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>MyApp Non-Stock Browser User:</strong></p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER if the user...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>has installed and uses a NON-stock Android browers, e.g. Dolphin HD/mini, Opera Mobile/Mini etc, or</li>\n<li>has a manufacturer customised version of Android (e.g. on Samsung Galaxy SII, etc) and therefore has a customised browser </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>... then here's the MAJOR ISSUE because the following events occur...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intent fires for the FB l.php URL </li>\n<li>FB URL gets opened in the NON-STOCK BROWSER</li>\n<li>The FB l.php is loaded and initiates the REDIRECT to <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a> </li>\n<li><strong>Intent IS NOT FIRED by the non-stock browser, the \"choose app dialog\" DOES NOT appear, the user is NOT prompted to open URL in my app</strong></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a> URL is loaded and rendered in a tab of the non-stock browser</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Client Side Redirect</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order to confirm its the redirect that was causing the problem,  I created a very simple HTML page named \"clientSideRedirector.htm\"</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n   window.location.href = \"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\";\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If My-App/non-stock browser user opens <a href=\"http://myapp.com/clientSideRedirector.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/clientSideRedirector.htm</a> the \"app choice dialog\" does NOT appear.  FAIL.</p>\n\n<p>If My-App/stock browser user opens <a href=\"http://myapp.com/clientSideRedirector.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/clientSideRedirector.htm</a> the \"app choice dialog\" DOES appear.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to tally up with what we're seeing with the Facebook share/redirect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Server Side (302) Redirect</strong></p>\n\n<p>I also thought I'd try a server side redirect so I created a .NET dotNetRedirect.ashx page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ShareRedirect : IHttpHandler\n{\n    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)\n    {\n            context.Response.Redirect(\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\");\n    }\n    public bool IsReusable { get { return false; } }\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This has a very interesting and different result to the client redirect.<br>\nIf My-App user opens the <a href=\"http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.htm</a> the \"app choice dialog\" DOES appear REGARDLESS of the users browser.\nSo this type of redirect seems to work!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Attempted Solution A</strong> </p>\n\n<p>(Double redirect: Facebook l.php redirect to server-side redirect to app URL)</p>\n\n<p>I thought this could be the solution to my Facebook sharing problems.  If I shared <a href=\"http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.ashx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.ashx</a> URL to Facebook then maybe Facebook would redirect to the dotNetRedirect.htm page and then the server side redirect would force the \"choose app dialog\" prompt to open. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this DOES NOT work, in a non-stock browser it would appear if the first redirect doesn't trigger the intent/\"choose app dialog\" further redirects won't either. Massively gutting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Attempted Solution B</strong> </p>\n\n<p>(Using a custom scheme)</p>\n\n<p>Having exhausted the server-side idea I thought I'd investigate using a custom URI scheme to trigger the \"app choice dialog\".</p>\n\n<p>AndroidManifest.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;\n  &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /&gt;\n  &lt;data android:scheme=\"myapp\" /&gt;\n&lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>redirect.htm</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n   window.location.href = \"myapp.com://sharedpage\";\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This does actually work, the \"choose app dialog\" appears via the DB l.php URL even when using a non-stock browser.  However it isn't really a feasible solution as it stands because \"non MyApp users\" are left with a \"Webpage not available\" page when redirected to the myapp.com://sharedpage URL. ]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Does anyone else have any other bright ideas or suggestions? </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","facebook","facebook-graph-api"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":2,"question_id":8471307,"title":"fetching all the events a user has been invited to with Facebook API","body":"<p>i am trying to retrieve user's events via \"...me/events\".<br>\nas written in the documentation the response includes only events which the user respond to.<br>\nis there any way getting also the events the user was invited to and has not respond?<br>\nthanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","facebook","post","sdk","schedule"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":9,"score":-2,"question_id":13236211,"title":"FB JS SDK - Scheduling a post","body":"<p>I am currently using FB JS SDK to publish my site contents to our fan page.

In the new framework based SDK they now handle this for you, but in order to migrate users (i.e. not have them re-login) I need to provide this information to the new SDK.</p>\n\n<p>It winds up being that Facebook is storing the K-Vs in NSUserDefaults and they even tell you the root key name as well as all the keys for the nested K-Vs of the dictionary they use to store this information.</p>\n\n<p>Their token class <code>FBSessionTokenCachingStrategy</code> even has a class method to verify if an NSDictionary validates to a proper dictionary that establishes a usable Facebook session</p>\n\n<p><code>+ (BOOL)isValidTokenInformation:(NSDictionary*)tokenInformation;</code></p>\n\n<p>So I've taken my preexisting auth. token and expiration, put them in a new dictionary, stored it in the proper key'ed location and synchronized NSUserDefaults.</p>\n\n<p>So far so good right?

I cannot test the code that is fired in the event of an error, if there is no error actually being fired.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nChris</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","facebook","facebook-apps","facebook-oauth"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13169086,"title":"Facebook $_REQUEST not working","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5253830/facebook-iframe-tab-signed-request-always-empty\">Facebook iframe tab signed request always empty</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm using some simple code to make a facebook like gateway and detect for country.

As soon as they logged back in, the tab stopped displaying for them. I've got it narrowed down it being an issue with their actual account being able to view tabs (from what I gather). Are there settings that allow people to view or not view tabs? I can't seem to find them.</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>Ok, so they still can't view the tab. They gave me their login and I went in and looked at the iFrame app on my computer through their account and it displayed correctly. So it's not an issue with their account and it's not an issue with caching. I've had several people check the iFrame and it works fine (in fact, nobody else is having this problem). This problem persists with tabs I built them. I'm currently having them check the version of Google Chrome they are using (I don't know if this would affect it at all). Any other ideas?</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>I just went into 'Edit Page' from the main admin menu and clicked on 'Apps' on the left side. I found the problem apps and clicked 'Link to this Tab' and I was given this message \"Some content in this message has been reported as abusive by Facebook users.\" There is no abusive content on these tabs.
