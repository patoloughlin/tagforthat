When a user creates an account on our service (I'll call it MyApp) through SSO, we associate their account on MySite with their Facebook uid and access token.  Then, based on their actions on MyApp, we can publish actions to their timeline and get access to their information on Facebook.  When the account is created, the user can also choose a password and later sign in without using Facebook, just with email and password.  By the way, there are also users whose accounts are not Facebook connected and who only can log in with email and password.  That is all, I think, pretty typical.</p>\n\n<p>However, we would like to have ways in the MyApp iOS client for a user to send user-to-user requests and share on others' timelines, both of which appear to require using the FBDialog API.  If the user logged in with Facebook, this should work fine because we have an active session for them.  However, if they are a Facebook-connected user who did not log in via Facebook, how can we open the dialog on their behalf?  Is it kosher for the app to retrieve the Facebook access token we have stored for the user on our backend?  If not, what other recourse is there?  We can open another Facebook session then, but the user could log in as a completely different user than the one to which their MyApp account is connected, which (while not necessarily that bad) is not the desired behavior. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help!

Again, and i will re-iterate, i saw this on a perfectly valid FB page. Below is a link to one of their albums. Note that this is entirely within the facebook domain. Click on any photo in this album and in the description you will see the text '\"Like\" www.facebook.com/OxfordBeach to tag your photos in this album' which from what i can tell is, in fact, a facebook setting. i have tested by liking the page, verifying that i can then tag a photo, then unliking the page and that ability disappears. at no point am i required to authorize anything - it's just a normal page like. this is not an app, or api being used here. there is no clickjacking, code injection, fql or open graph or any other non-fb client-side code being executed, nor am i interested in using any of the above or breaking any ToS. i'm just wondering if it's a FB setting i'm missing. I've been through FB documentation and can't find any mention of it, and i have a FB forum question outstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the public album:\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.361407077282795.87068.197745466982291&amp;type=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.361407077282795.87068.197745466982291&amp;type=1</a></p>\n\n<p>SECOND EDIT: I should note that the ability to comment on the photo exists whether or not you like the page. so i wrote that in the initial question in error. it's really just the tagging of photos that is switched on or off based on whether or not you like the page.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","facebook","osx","cocoa","acaccount"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13258922,"title":"How to access the user's facebook account?

Maybe the problem is that Facebook fan page is alcohol related so its not possible to get correct token without authorization or maybe Im doing something wrong.   </p>\n\n<p>So any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","actionscript-3","flash","post"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13254453,"title":"Posting to Facebook from flash with linebreaks","body":"<p>I've been able to make the external call to facebook from flash.\nHowever, I need to make a linebreak within the code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var caption:String = \"I just got the \" + objectivename + \" achievement in the Study Break Arcade. &lt;br/&gt; Powered by Capella University!\";\nvar description:String = \"Come play with me!\";\nflash.external.ExternalInterface.call('postToFacebook', linkname, link, picture, caption, description, actionname, actionlink);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've attempted \\n and just now <br /> but neither work.\nDoes anyone know how to add a Linebreak between sentences on a facebook post?</p>\n\n<p>(Some code has been omitted for clarity)</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","facebook"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13254108,"title":"facebook PHP api stopped working","body":"<p>I'm trying to write an app that will post images the user makes to a user's wall in facebook, it was working until about an hour ago now i'm getting a catch error of \"An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.\". hopefully someone has a quick answer :)</p>\n\n<p>here is my starting PHP that gets the user and checks for the album</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    include 'src/facebook.php';\n    $facebook = new Facebook(array(\n        'appId' =&gt; ID,\n        'secret' =&gt; SECRET,\n        'cookie' =&gt; true\n        ));\n\n    $me = null;\n    $thisPhoto = null;\n    $album_name = NAME;\n    $album_message = MESSAGE;\n\n    try {\n        $me = $facebook-&gt;api('/me');\n        $facebook-&gt;setFileUploadSupport(true);      \n        // check if album with name exists...if not create it\n        $albums = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/albums');\n        foreach($albums['data'] as $album)  {\n            if($album['name'] == $album_name) {\n                $album_uid = $album['id'];\n                }\n            }\n        if (!$album_uid) {\n            $album_details = array(\n                'message'=&gt; $album_message,\n                'name'=&gt; $album_name\n                );\n            $create_album = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/albums', 'post', $album_details);\n            $album_uid = $create_album['id'] . \"MADE\";\n            }\n        //echo \"&lt;!-- $album_uid --&gt;\\n\";\n        }\n    catch (FacebookApiException $e) {\n        echo \"&lt;!-- \" . $e-&gt;getMessage() . \" --&gt;\\n\";\n        }\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my main HTML (the above is called before the doctype)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;'TITLE&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\"&gt;\n        &lt;style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\"&gt;\n            html, body { width:100%; background-color: #FFF;}\n            body {  margin:0 auto; padding:0; width:760px}\n            #flashContent { width:100%; height:100%; }\n        &lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;?php   \n    //print_r($me);\n    //echo $facebook-&gt;getUser();\n    //echo $facebook-&gt;getAccessToken();\n\n    // START\n    if($me) {\n        // true makes print_r give human readable instead of just a screen dump\n        //echo '&lt;pre&gt;' . print_r($VARIABLE, true) .

This is being phased out on November 7, by which time one needs to convert all such pages to \"real\" facebook pages following the procedure Facebook documents here:</p>\n\n<p>developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/migration/</p>\n\n<p>Our nonprofit organization operates web pages (and Facebook pages) for just over 200 breed-specific animal rescue groups, all of which have Facebook like buttons on each web page.  I've successfully migrated over about 20 of these pages using the procedure designated in the page above.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm having is that at some point recently, Facebook stopped creating the Admin pages when a page admin likes a web page.  This means, for about 80% or so of the rescue pages we have (many with 1000's of likes), I have no way to \"migrate\" them because there is no page to migrate.</p>\n\n<p>All of these pages have identical code as the pages I was able to migrate, the only difference is I never went, and as page Admin, clicked the Like button on any of these pages, so Facebook never created any page which I can use for the migration process.  (I would have done this months ago had I known Facebook was phasing out this ability, but I don't think it was ever announced.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know when Facebook discontinued creating Admin pages for web pages with Like buttons, but having discontinued it before the November 7 actual migration deadline, we have no way now to access the likes from many of our web pages to migrate them over to our actual Facebook pages.</p>\n\n<p>This might be better illustrated by examples.  We operate a page for Pit Bull Rescue here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pitbull.rescueme.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pitbull.rescueme.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>I successfully migrated the \"Likes\" from that page to our actual Facebook page here using the documentation on Facebook's migration page:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pitbull.rescueme.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.facebook.com/pitbull.rescueme.org</a></p>\n\n<p>(Note the \"Like\" count on the Facebook on the web page is higher, because Facebook counts certain shares on a page, that don't count as actual likes on a Facebook page.)</p>\n\n<p>But here's a page with the problem: australianshepherd.rescueme.org</p>\n\n<p>It has 383 Likes but there is no way for me to migrate those likes over because there is no associated page in my Facebook account to migrate.  I created a Facebook page to merge these likes into ( www.facebook.com/australianshepherd.rescueme.org ) but don't know how to get them there.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I would have just clicked the Like button on the WEB page itself, and an Admin page would have been created.  Apparently Facebook discontinued that ability at some point long before the November 7 migration deadline, so I have no idea how I can fix this.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine (or hope) there is some parameter perhaps I can switch in some app settings panel to help with this, but I can't find any way to do it.  Any suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>I've been told I need to ask someone at Facebook to manually transfer \"Likes\" from such pages over to our actual Facebook pages, but have not been able to reach someone to do this.  If this is the necessary step, can someone from Facebook please contact me privately, or post here how to get that type of assistance.</p>\n\n<p>If this was just a few hundred likes it wouldn't be a big deal, but cumulatively I believe we have well over 100,000 fans we will lose if we can't fix this. The hundreds of volunteers running all these rescue group web pages who spent many hours each week over the past year building up our fan base, aren't going to be pleased about learning all their efforts will be lost.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be very, very appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>Jeff Gold</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","facebook","ios6"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":1,"question_id":13236778,"title":"Facebook in iOS6.0 use SLRequest to upload a photo failed anyway","body":"<p>Here Comes my Objc code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ACAccountStore *facebookaccount = [[ACAccountStore alloc] init];\nACAccountType *facebookaccountType = [facebookaccount accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifier: ACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook];\n// Specify App ID and permissions\nNSDictionary *options = @{ ACFacebookAppIdKey: @\"1234567899876543\", ACFacebookPermissionsKey: @[@\"publish_stream\"], ACFacebookAudienceKey: ACFacebookAudienceFriends };\n[facebookaccount requestAccessToAccountsWithType:facebookaccountType options:options completion:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {\n    if(granted) {\n        NSArray *accountsArray = [facebookaccount accountsWithAccountType:facebookaccountType];\n        if ([accountsArray count] &gt; 0) {\n            ACAccount *facebookAccount = [accountsArray objectAtIndex:0];\n\n            NSString *sendmessage = @\"Face\";\n            NSData *myImageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(imageSource);\n\n            SLRequest *facebookRequest = [SLRequest requestForServiceType:SLServiceTypeFacebook requestMethod:SLRequestMethodPOST URL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://graph.facebook.com/me/photos\"] parameters:nil];\n\n            [facebookRequest addMultipartData:myImageData withName:@\"source\" type:@\"multipart/form-data\" filename:nil];\n            [facebookRequest addMultipartData:[sendmessage dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] withName:@\"message\" type:@\"multipart/form-data\" filename:nil];\n\n            [facebookRequest setAccount:facebookAccount];\n\n            [facebookRequest performRequestWithHandler:^(NSData* responseData, NSHTTPURLResponse* urlResponse, NSError* error) {\n                if (error == nil) {\n                    NSLog(@\"responedata:%@\", [[NSString alloc] initWithData:responseData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]);\n                }else{\n                    NSLog(@\"%@\",error.description);\n                }\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"error description : %@\",[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\", error.localizedDescription]);\n    }\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally I get these respone data:</p>\n\n<p>responedata:{\"error\":{\"message\":\"(#324) Requires upload file\",\"type\":\"OAuthException\",\"code\":324}}</p>\n\n<p>Help me please!!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","facebook"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3880,"score":0,"question_id":5799750,"title":"Share photo on Facebook for android","body":"<p>My application's objective is to take a photo using camera activity and save this photo in android internal storage and then allow the user to share this photo in Facebook as wall post, my problem is I couldn't find any source that show/explain how to share photo in FB and I am totally new with Facebook API</p>\n\n<p>Any help PLZ!</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","caching","facebook-like"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":428,"score":1,"question_id":7483935,"title":"How to refresh the cached title of a page Liked on Facebook?","body":"<p>I have a couple of embedded YouTube videos which I have added Like buttons for.

One of the core features of the application is that users can share app specific URLs to Facebook and Twitter etc so that their friends can follow the shared URLs which will open up either the HTML5 version of my app in their browser OR MOST IMPORTANTLY if they are on Android and they have my native Android app installed they are PROMPTED TO OPEN IN MY APP.</p>\n\n<p>This is a rather long complicated issue so to simplify I'll use some certain terms consistently through-out this post:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"MyApp user\" a Android device user who DOES have my native Android app installed</li>\n<li>\"non-MyApp user\" a Android device user who DOES NOT have my native Android app installed</li>\n<li>\"stock browser user\" a stock Android user who uses a stock browser </li>\n<li>\"non-stock browser user\" a Android user who uses a non-stock browser (note the Samsung Galaxy SII stock \"Internet\" app is considered non-stock)</li>\n<li>\"choose app dialog\" on Android the OS dialog that appears asking the user what application they want to open the action/intent/url/document with and if they want to default to use this application always</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My AndroidManifest.xml contains the following...</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;\n  &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /&gt;\n  &lt;data android:scheme=\"http\" android:host=\"myapp.com\" android:pathPrefix=\"/\" /&gt;\n&lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When tested this WORKS PERFECTLY in any normal scenario. For example if a \"MyApp user\" follows a direct link to <a href=\"http://myapp.com/sharedpage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/sharedpage</a>, the \"choose app dialog\" appears. Great, I've definitely configured my AndroidManifest.xml correctly.</p>\n\n<p>However things do NOT ALWAYS WORK in the critical Facebook sharing scenerio.  It does not always work because both Facebook's native Android app and Facebook's mobile website (http://m.facebook.com) DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY to the shared URLs but instead link via a Facebook redirect page.

If I shared <a href=\"http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.ashx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myapp.com/dotNetRedirect.ashx</a> URL to Facebook then maybe Facebook would redirect to the dotNetRedirect.htm page and then the server side redirect would force the \"choose app dialog\" prompt to open. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this DOES NOT work, in a non-stock browser it would appear if the first redirect doesn't trigger the intent/\"choose app dialog\" further redirects won't either. Massively gutting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Attempted Solution B</strong> </p>\n\n<p>(Using a custom scheme)</p>\n\n<p>Having exhausted the server-side idea I thought I'd investigate using a custom URI scheme to trigger the \"app choice dialog\".</p>\n\n<p>AndroidManifest.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;\n  &lt;action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /&gt;\n  &lt;category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /&gt;\n  &lt;data android:scheme=\"myapp\" /&gt;\n&lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>redirect.htm</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n   window.location.href = \"myapp.com://sharedpage\";\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This does actually work, the \"choose app dialog\" appears via the DB l.php URL even when using a non-stock browser.  However it isn't really a feasible solution as it stands because \"non MyApp users\" are left with a \"Webpage not available\" page when redirected to the myapp.com://sharedpage URL. ]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Does anyone else have any other bright ideas or suggestions? </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","facebook","facebook-graph-api"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":2,"question_id":8471307,"title":"fetching all the events a user has been invited to with Facebook API","body":"<p>i am trying to retrieve user's events via \"...me/events\".<br>\nas written in the documentation the response includes only events which the user respond to.<br>\nis there any way getting also the events the user was invited to and has not respond?<br>\nthanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","facebook","post","sdk","schedule"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":9,"score":-2,"question_id":13236211,"title":"FB JS SDK - Scheduling a post","body":"<p>I am currently using FB JS SDK to publish my site contents to our fan page.

I can't find any solution for this case(and good solution will be great).

In the new framework based SDK they now handle this for you, but in order to migrate users (i.e. not have them re-login) I need to provide this information to the new SDK.</p>\n\n<p>It winds up being that Facebook is storing the K-Vs in NSUserDefaults and they even tell you the root key name as well as all the keys for the nested K-Vs of the dictionary they use to store this information.</p>\n\n<p>Their token class <code>FBSessionTokenCachingStrategy</code> even has a class method to verify if an NSDictionary validates to a proper dictionary that establishes a usable Facebook session</p>\n\n<p><code>+ (BOOL)isValidTokenInformation:(NSDictionary*)tokenInformation;</code></p>\n\n<p>So I've taken my preexisting auth. token and expiration, put them in a new dictionary, stored it in the proper key'ed location and synchronized NSUserDefaults.</p>\n\n<p>So far so good right?

As soon as they logged back in, the tab stopped displaying for them. I've got it narrowed down it being an issue with their actual account being able to view tabs (from what I gather). Are there settings that allow people to view or not view tabs? I can't seem to find them.</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>Ok, so they still can't view the tab. They gave me their login and I went in and looked at the iFrame app on my computer through their account and it displayed correctly. So it's not an issue with their account and it's not an issue with caching. I've had several people check the iFrame and it works fine (in fact, nobody else is having this problem). This problem persists with tabs I built them. I'm currently having them check the version of Google Chrome they are using (I don't know if this would affect it at all). Any other ideas?</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>I just went into 'Edit Page' from the main admin menu and clicked on 'Apps' on the left side. I found the problem apps and clicked 'Link to this Tab' and I was given this message \"Some content in this message has been reported as abusive by Facebook users.\" There is no abusive content on these tabs.

Facebook expose the offset positioning for cropping a larger version of a user's profile thumbnail?","body":"<p>I've recently noticed that in the layouts for the new Timeline profile, Facebook is using the \"normal\" version (read: larger) of the user's profile image extensively, both on the Timeline and in the Friends List. As we all know, this image is retrieved by querying the graph with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/[userid]/picture?type=normal\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, this image isn't a guaranteed square crop. However, Facebook uses element-level CSS to position and crop it manually (see image below). The positioning is interesting in that it's seemingly generated before page render.</p>\n\n<p>See:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Efi3.png\" alt=\"http://imgur.com/lapbO\"></p>\n\n<p>Notice how there's an element-level CSS style applied. In this case it's a top offset:</p>\n\n<pre><code>style=\"top:-50%\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm assuming that this is pulling the arbitrary offset/positioning value from somewhere (the graph, a db, etc.), not using some client-side JS for facial detection, since the process of setting a new Facebook profile picture (usually) involves manually cropping your face. See it for yourself: change your profile picture and if the proportions aren't square-ish, there's an intermediate, manual cropping step.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this image is posted to /photo.php with the x, y, width, height, and other various parameters passed. I know some of that is used to generate the 50x50 square crop, but it also has to be stored somewhere else, correct?</p>\n\n<p>My question is whether or not Facebook currently exposes a method to retrieve these offset values so we can accurately square-crop the larger profile pictures without having to rely on facial recognition or client-side processing to guarantee that the subject is centered.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","facebook","storyboard"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":91,"score":2,"question_id":11498046,"title":"Facebook SDK in Storyboard?","body":"<p>Is it possible to use the Facebook SDK 3.0 with iPhone storyboard?

I've already got that part working correctly if I don't use the new native Facebook Composer (either old style dialogs, or just a direct post with no dialog). </p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm encountering is when using the new SLComposeViewController, the post will appear to come from the application \"iOS\" id \"213546525407071\" rather than the id for my application.  </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to change the attributed application so that it uses my application ID instead of iOS?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","oauth","native"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13095050,"title":"FB oauth token through native fb app (pre iOS 6)","body":"<p>I believe I've seen it done before, but how can one do the OAuth progress from one app to through the native Facebook app on iOS?

We obtain the <strong>publish_stream</strong>, <strong>offline_access</strong> and <strong>manage_pages</strong> permissions (more on that later).</p>\n\n<p>All the code is in C# but the principles apply to any language as it's the workings of the <strong>Facebook API</strong> we are concerned with. We're using <strong>OAuth 2</strong> and the <strong>Graph API</strong> to achieve all of this.</p>\n\n<p>So, we obtain an <strong>app access token</strong> using our <strong>app ID</strong> and <strong>secret</strong> and use that token to publish to the user's timeline, this works fine (because they have already authorised our app to do this). We can also query the Graph API and get their <strong>likes</strong>, <strong>friends</strong> and various other data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOW HERE IS THE PROBLEM:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of our users want to publish updates to their own timelime and also to the timelines of pages that they manage. In theory this is simple: you query the API for the pages that the user manages using this url: <a href=\"https://graph.facebook.com/%7Buserid%7D/accounts?access_token=%7Btoken%7D\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://graph.facebook.com/{userid}/accounts?access_token={token}</a></p>\n\n<p>The JSON returned from this call is said to contain the page IDs and the page access tokens for those pages. You then use the page access token to publish to the pages' timelines.</p>\n\n<p>However, when we try to call this URL with the <strong>app access token</strong> we are getting an OAuthException <strong>102</strong> \"A user access token is required to request this resource\".</p>\n\n<p>Note this is different to OAuthException <strong>104</strong> \"An access token is required to request this resource\" (which is what you'd get if you neglected to pass an access token), and also OAuthException <strong>190</strong> \"Invalid OAuth access token signature\" (which you would get if the access token was not a valid one).</p>\n\n<p>So our access token is valid, but just not valid for this particular url. It seems therefore that we need a <strong>user access token</strong> and not an <strong>app access token</strong> for this particular feed (I am long past caring why this is the case, it just seems to be the way it is).</p>\n\n<p>All the Facebook documentation on this subject (and I must have read all of it by now) leads to one place: <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/</a>, aka the \"Server-Side Authentication Flow\" page. This page describes how to get the elusive user access token by redirecting the user to the auth dialog and asking for the relevant permissions <strong>but we need to achieve this without interaction from the user and the user has already given our app all the permissions we need</strong>. All of this automated publishing happens server side in the post-processing of the audio so we cannot interact with the user at this stage anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I don't get it. Why is it we can use the app access token to get almost any data we want from the user (well, whatever they have given us permission to get) but the <strong>/accounts</strong> data we need a different (user) access token for?</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed any light on how we can get a user access token which will allow us to get the /accounts data for our users without any further interaction from the user?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","connect","friend","invite"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3484,"score":1,"question_id":7562516,"title":"Inviting Facebook friends through iPhone App","body":"<p>I've been searching this question, and I haven't been able to find anything that works.

One of the requirements is to be included in a Facebook page as a tab. This application will contain on a page a send button in order to be able to make it more engaging with specific people, users of the application would choose on their own. The reason behind this is because the Facebook page containing the application is related to alcohol, and \"liking\" the application will get more audition and potential children.

In case the user agent is Facebook crawler to serve an html empty page just with the open graph tags, otherwise redirect to the desired URL - which in our case is the facebook page www.facebook.com/mycustompage.</p>\n\n<p>The message produced contains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the title which is a link to www.mycustomdomain.com/og which when\nclicked opens a page in a new tab with the address\nwww.facebook.com/mycustompage - this is relatively ok</li>\n<li>under the title I have a \"sub-title\" readonly text containing the domain of the link: www.mycustomdomain.com  - THIS IS NOT OK since I don't want to share where I have hosted the application.</li>\n<li>the image and the desired description - this is ok.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What I want to know if there is a better way to do this rather than this workaround.</li>\n<li>If not I would like to know how I can hide for the produced message the \"sub-title\" so that the hosted domain is not visible.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","facebook-like","facebook-fql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13075507,"title":"Getting all my family likes (fan pages) using FQL","body":"<p>I'm trying to get the list of fan pages my family liked.

All assets are sent via S3, so there shouldn't be any issues there.</p>\n\n<p>FYI, here's my P3P file; I've tried absolute paths, relative paths, switching order of CP and policyref, and separated the two into separate header calls with no luck.</p>\n\n<pre><code>header('P3P: CP=\"NON DSP TAIa PSAa PSDa OUR IND UNI\", policyref=\"/w3c/p3p.xml\"');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have confirmed that the P3P Header is being sent and received by the browser.

This works OK. I store it in the Session because I want to save it to a database <em>after</em> the user is authenticated. If user was logged on to the app, I redirect him to <code>APP_URL/step3</code>; if not, I redirect him to login dialog, with <code>&amp;redirect_uri=APP_URL/step3</code> .

I am hoping to not have to sneak out and buy/borrow an iPad just to get to the bottom of this.</p>\n\n<p>Basically when we use my company's iPads (which were set up a few months back prior to me joining the company), Facebook login works just fine. User inputs username/password, hits login, they are immediately prompted to authorize our application. However, when we use the third party's iPads, almost every single time, Facebook initiates an unregistered device issue and forces the captcha + Photo Verification/ID process in order to complete the login process.</p>\n\n<p>I did a variety of tests that ensured this was in no way related to a) our ISP/IP; b) our Facebook app c) incorrect credentials being entered; d) individual account security settings. The jist of those tests centered around using the same account on one of my company's iPads, then one of the third party's iPads. I've narrowed it down to being a local device setting, I think. However, I did not have time to go through the iPad + Safari settings such as private browsing etc.</p>\n\n<p>As a QA person, I am fully aware that my next step would have been to compare the settings of our functional iPads to theirs which end up with the verification issue. That being said, all the equipment had to be packed up and sent on the road before I could complete my testing.</p>\n\n<p>So, if anyone has specific experience related to this sort of issue (Facebook login verification) I'd really appreciate any tips that you can provide to make sure users are not prompted for excessive security verifications, as it slows down our registration process in an unacceptable manner.</p>\n\n<p>Kindly, Dave</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","button","count","like"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":70,"score":1,"question_id":12853430,"title":"Two facebook like buttons on same page with different count","body":"<p>I have two facebook like buttons on the same page, however they are showing two different counts..

It's lame, but there seems to be no alternative (?).  Would this be allowed then? -> In a certain way this also tells something about being in a physical location, but without using GeoLocation. And could I perhaps use Nearby places API if I make the functionality entirely separate from the check-in functional wise (very lame for the user but it's being with the back against the wall).<br>\nAnother way I had in mind was to get bar owners to paste qr codes of their own bars on windows or make stamps on beer cards.

Searching, I came across <a href=\"http://sitecheck.sucuri.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sucuri SiteCheck</a> which showed that McAfee TrustedSource had marked the site as having malicious content. Strange considering that I just bought it, it contains nothing but WordPress and I can't find any previous history of ownership. But I got McAfee to reclassify it and it now shows up green at SiteCheck. However, now a few days later, Facebook still blocks it. Clicking the \"let us know\" link in the FB block dialog got me to a \"Blocked from Adding Content\" form that I submitted, but this just triggered a confirmation mail stating that individual issues are not processed.</p>\n\n<p>I then noticed the same behavior as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10190649/site-not-valid-but-it-is\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://facebook.stackoverflow.com/questions/11843242/site-url-blocked-as-spammy-but-also-no-data-was-scraped-in-debug\">here</a>: When I type in any iacro.dk link on my Timeline it generates a blank preview with \"(No Title)\". It doesn't matter if it's the front page, a htm document or even an image - nothing is returned. So I tried the debugger which returns the very generic \"Error Parsing URL: Error parsing input URL, no data was scraped.\". Searching on this site, a lot of people suggest that missing \"og:\" tags might cause no scraping. I installed a WP plugin for that and verified tag generation, but nothing changed. And since FB can't even scrape plain htm / jpg from the domain, I assume tags can be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8631411/open-graph-warnings-when-validating-page-with-facebook-object-debugger\">Here</a> someone suggests 301 Redirects being a problem, but I haven't set up redirection - I don't even have a .htaccess file.</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions are: Is this all because of the domain being marked as \"spammy\"? If so, how can I get the FB ban lifted? However, I have seen examples of other \"spammy\" sites where the preview is being generated just fine, e.g. <a href=\"http://dagbok.nu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dagbok.nu</a> described in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10190649/site-not-valid-but-it-is\">this question</a>.

Hence I have my own function that populates the current page URL (including any variables that might be present in the URL) in a constant called: <strong>CURRENT_URL</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So my revised code for the Like button looks like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/likebox.php?href=&lt;?php echo CURRENT_URL; ?&gt;&amp;width=292&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;show_faces=false&amp;stream=false&amp;header=false&amp;height=62\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:292px; height:62px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I use the above revised code in my website, I dont see the Like box. Instead, I see an error page in the Iframe that says: </p>\n\n<pre><code>The page you requested was not found.\nYou may have clicked an expired link or mistyped the address. Some web addresses are case sensitive.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I do a general <code>&lt;?php echo CURRENT_URL; ?</code>, it is showing the correct URL. There is no problem with the value of the constant. This makes me feel that the iframe is simply trying to load the website name without parsing the constant value. I just want a code that I can use throughout the website without having to manually change the Like button value for each of the pages of my website.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make this iframe detect the current page URL (including any variables that I may be passing via the URL) and populate the Like button URL value to the current page URL so that user can like this page.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>All help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE (Solution):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found out that theres a big confusion about all this. There are actually 2 types of Like features. One is a normal Like button and the other is Like box. Here are the links:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like Button:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Like Box:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box</a></p>\n\n<p>Use the Like <strong>Button</strong> code if you want to be people to like the individual pages of your website. The Like <strong>Box</strong> asks you for: Facebook Page URL. This means that you CANNOT use it for your users to Like your web pages. (I am still working on understanding about Facebook Page URL and how it works and when it fails)</p>\n\n<p>Hope this information helps anyone else going through the same trouble and confusion.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","facebook","facebook-graph-api","facebook-php-sdk"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":229,"score":0,"question_id":8507599,"title":"how to delete video","body":"<p>i can upload video to my facebook page via graph api. and i cant delete this video.</p>\n\n<p>i trying this but not work (php sdk)</p>\n\n<pre><code>$facebook-&gt;api(\"/VIDEO_ID\", \"DELETE\", array('access_token' =&gt; 'ACCESS_TOKEN'));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this request responsing bellow error</p>\n\n<pre><code>GraphMethodException: Unsupported delete request.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but i can deleting this way any feed post  </p>\n\n<p>i have manage_pages permission.</p>\n\n<p>im sorry for my bad english\nthank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","oauth","facebook-access-token"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":207,"score":0,"question_id":9990972,"title":"After extending an access token, does that make it valid for another 60 days?","body":"<p>If I requested and acquired an access token on, say, the 1st of March, and extended it on 30 days later, will it be valid for <em>another</em> 60 days, or does it require reauthorization from the end user? </p>\n\n<p>We are implementing an autopost functionality, which is triggered by an event inside our own application.

It gave me data for the first 40 posts, but in the 3rd batch request, only 5 posts' data was fetched, but for remaining 15 posts, there was no data returned by facebook. (This simply negates the 600 seconds and 600 requests answer.)</p>\n\n<p>Scene 4 : I kept the batches to 20 urls, but introduced a sleep timer for 5 seconds. This helped me get all the data.</p>\n\n<p>The problem lies for me when the number of posts increase to upto 1000 or more, then even after putting a 2 second sleep after every request, facebook doesn't return any data after a certain period of time.</p>\n\n<p>I hope someone knows the answer for this !!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","facebook","facebook-graph-api","facebook-fql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":1,"question_id":8524578,"title":"facebook: Value of the zip and address of current_location","body":"<p>Why can not I get the value of the zip and address of the user?

I'm trying to get my app to publish a message to the users facebook feed, and a checkin to a facebook Place after selecting a local place from the placesPicker in iOS.</p>\n\n<p>I've pretty much got everything working in testing, meaning when I just hand type string values for all the postParams for the NSMutableDictionary, it posts perfectly. ex:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.postParams =\n    [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:\n     @\"I am doing XYZ\", @\"message\",\n     @\"123456abc\",@\"tags\",\n     @\"123456xyz,@\"place\",\n     nil];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above postParams work perfectly when published to feed, it displays the message, then checks in to the \"place\" id and says you are with the userid in \"tags\".  The problem is that I am really getting the Place id from the Facebook SDK's placePicker.  I've got the picker setup and working perfectly, but I can not figure out how to replace the hardcoded @\"123456xyz\" with the id from the picked Place.</p>\n\n<p>this is currently what I have in there now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.postParams =\n        [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:\n         @\"I am doing XYZ\", @\"message\",\n         @\"123456abc\",@\"tags\",\n         self.selectedPlace.id,@\"place\",\n         nil];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>self.selectedplace.id does successfully contain the id of the Place, when i print it with debug/NSLog in console, it is holding the value accurately.  but when i try to publish this after picking a place, I get \"error: domain = com.facebook.sdk, code = 5\"</p>\n\n<p>Here is how self.selectedPlace is defined &amp; synthesized:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSObject&lt;FBGraphPlace&gt; *selectedPlace;\n\n...\n\n@synthesize selectedPlace = _selectedPlace;\n\n...\n\n[placePicker presentModallyFromViewController:self\n                                     animated:YES\n                                      handler:^(FBViewController *sender, BOOL donePressed) {\n                                          if (donePressed) {\n                                              self.selectedPlace = placePicker.selection;\n                                          }\n                                      }];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, to sum my question:  How can I successfully get this Place id that is stored in self.selectedPlace.id into the postParams dictionary, so that it can be successfully interpreted &amp; published to the user's feed?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I should warn everyone upfront... I am self taught and still learning, and although I can look at the code, understand what it does, and write it... I'm afraid I'm not great with the terminology &amp; discussing/understanding some of the language... lol so it would help me a great deal if you keep that in mind in any answers or comments :)  Thanks, and I'm looking forward to breaking out of my stackoverflow newb shell and becoming more apart of the community here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","fql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":218,"score":1,"question_id":11628740,"title":"FQL - Order photos in album by like_count","body":"<p>I'm trying to get the photos of a <em>Facebook</em> album ordered by like count in <em>FQL</em> with a this query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT like_info, object_id FROM photo WHERE aid=\"xxxxxxxxxx_xxxx\" ORDER BY like_info.like_count desc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I get an error <code>(#602) like_count is not a member of the like_info scalar.</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT like_info, object_id FROM photo WHERE aid=\"xxxxxxxxxx_xxxx\" ORDER BY like_info desc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does the trick, but I don't know why: isn't *like_info* an object?

I'm attempting to implement timeline features into my application. However, when try changing my meta tags to change the tile of my object, the changes are not reflected. When I pass my url into the debugger tool facebook offers, it displays that my OG object is still using the old data, as opposed to the new data. However, the weird thing is the raw properties show my changes. How do I get facebook to update the OG object?</p>\n\n<p>Another problem I'm having is that when I make changes to my actions, facebook isn't properly updating it. When I reopen the action, it's still referencing my old object titles. For example, if a title of one of my movie objects was \"sci fi,\" and I reference \"sci fi\" in the action \"see,\" it will still be referencing \"sci fi\" even if I try to change it to something else. I would save and it, but when I reopened the action the old settings where still there.</p>\n\n<p>I was also wondering about dynamic generation of objects. For example, if I had an app that allowed people to list movies they've watched, could I dynamically generate the OG object so that users can have the \"see a $movie\" show up in their timeline no matter what movie it was? The reason I'm wondering is because right now I'm unsure whether or not I need to keep the page with the meta tags up after I use it once. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the word blocks and if my questions seem basic to you.
