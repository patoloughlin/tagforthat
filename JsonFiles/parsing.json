Second file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>products = []\n(x_min/interval..x_max/interval).each do |x|\n  (y_min/interval..y_max/interval).each do|y|\n  products &lt;&lt; [x*interval,y*interval]\n  end\nend\n\na = products.map.with_index{|w, i| \"#{i+1} #{w[0].to_s} #{w[1].to_s} \\n\"}\n\naFile = File.new( products_file, \"w+\")\nif aFile\n    a.each{|x| aFile.write(x)}\n    else\n    puts \"Something wrong!\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The question is: How to put this thing together?

I'm having a little bit of trouble figuring out the best way to define function signatures, and determining whose responsibility it is to validate the input to those functions.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I have a simple grammar that defines the basic elements of my language.  This includes  a handful of binary operators, parentheses, numbers, identifiers, and function calls. The BNF for my grammar looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; | &lt;parenexp&gt; | &lt;binexp&gt; | &lt;fncall&gt; | &lt;identifier&gt;\n&lt;parenexp&gt;   ::= ( &lt;expression&gt; )\n&lt;fncall&gt;     ::= &lt;identifier&gt; ( &lt;argumentlist&gt; )\n&lt;binexp&gt;     ::= &lt;expression&gt; &lt;binop&gt; &lt;expression&gt;\n&lt;binop&gt;      ::= + - * / %\n... the rest of the grammar definition\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the Irony parser, I am able to validate the syntax of various input strings to make sure they conform to this grammar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x + y / z * AVG(a + b, p)   -&gt; Valid Syntax\nx +/ AVG(x                  -&gt; Invalid Syntax\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All that is well and good, but now I want to go a step further and define the available functions, along with the number of parameters that each function requires.  So for example, I want to have a function <code>FOO</code> that accepts one parameter and <code>BAR</code> that accepts two parameters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FOO(a + b) * BAR(x + y, p + q)    -&gt; Valid\nFOO(a + b, 13)                    -&gt;  Invalid\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the second statement is parsed, I'd like to be able to output an error message that is aware of the expected input for this function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Too many arguments specified for function 'FOO'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't actually need to evaluate any of these statements, only validate the syntax of the statements and determine if they are valid expressions or not.  </p>\n\n<p>How exactly should I be doing this?  I know that technically I could simply add the functions to the grammar like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;foofncall&gt; ::= FOO( &lt;expression&gt; )\n&lt;barfncall&gt; ::= BAR( &lt;expression&gt;, &lt;expression&gt; )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But something about this doesn't feel quite right.  To me it seems like the grammar should only define a generic function call, and not every function available to the language.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How is this typically accomplished in other languages?  </li>\n<li>What are the components called that should handle the responsibilities of analyzing the basic syntax of the language grammar versus the more specific elements like function definitions?  Should both responsibilities be handled by the same component?</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["xml","exception","parsing","utf-8"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2116,"score":0,"question_id":2786926,"title":"MalformedByteSequenceException while trying to pars XML","body":"<p>Hey guy, maybe someone can help:</p>\n\n<p>I have the following .gpx data from wikipedia:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\" ?&gt;\n&lt;gpx xmlns=\"http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1\" creator=\"byHand\" version=\"1.1\" \nxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \nxsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd\"&gt;\n  &lt;wpt lat=\"39.921055008\" lon=\"3.054223107\"&gt;\n    &lt;ele&gt;12.863281&lt;/ele&gt;\n    &lt;time&gt;2005-05-16T11:49:06Z&lt;/time&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Cala Sant Vicenç - Mallorca&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;sym&gt;City&lt;/sym&gt;\n  &lt;/wpt&gt;\n&lt;/gpx&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I call my parsing method, I get a exception (see below) The call looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Document tmpDoc = getParsedXML(currentGPX);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My method to parse looks like this (standart parsing code, nothing exctiting....):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static Document getParsedXML(String fileWithPath){\n    DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n    DocumentBuilder db;\n    Document doc = null;\n    try {\n        db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();\n        doc = db.parse(new File(fileWithPath));\n    } catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (SAXException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return doc;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This simple code throws following exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.io.MalformedByteSequenceException: Invalid byte 2 of 3-byte UTF-8 sequence.\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.io.UTF8Reader.invalidByte(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.io.UTF8Reader.read(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityScanner.load(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityScanner.skipChar(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl$FragmentContentDriver.next(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentScannerImpl.next(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.scanDocument(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XMLParser.parse(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.DOMParser.parse(Unknown Source)\nat com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.DocumentBuilderImpl.parse(Unknown Source)\nat javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder.parse(Unknown Source)\nat Zeugs.getParsedXML(Zeugs.java:38)\nat Zeugs.main(Zeugs.java:25)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I guess the error lies within the format of the first file, but I don't know where exactly.\nCan you please give me a hint?</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","perl","parsing","crawler"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":1,"question_id":13261330,"title":"Can't call method \"get_token\" on an undefined value","body":"<p>Whenever I run TokeParser I get this undefined error.

I have the algorithm, but I am wholy unsure with the implementation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong> If you have done a project similar to this before with Objective-C, what tips can you provide for me?

(I gather that this would correspond to the two-part problem of writing an input file for lex or flex, specifying the \"grammar\" for the lexical analyzer/tokenizer, and an input file for yacc or bison, specifying the grammar proper.  The distinction between the lexical analysis and parsing stages seems to me a bit artificial, and I gather that some parsing packages abolish it altogether, but I admit that my grasp on all this is very tenuous, so these parenthetical remarks may very well be all hogwash.)</p>\n\n<p>One more clarification: As the example I began this post with already makes clear, I am not concerned at the moment with the problem of designing a syntax (as language designer would have to do, for example) although I'm sure it is an interesting problem of its own right.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>[I originally asked this a version of this question in programmers.SE, but learned that questions that ask for a reference to the literature are frowned upon in that stack, because they don't lend themselves to extended, discursive replies, so I'm trying my luck here.]</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","xml","regex","parsing","vba"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":10,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2484,"score":12,"question_id":8798260,"title":"html parsing of cricinfo scorecards","body":"<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am looking to scrape 20/20 cricket scorecard data from the <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com\">Cricinfo wesbite</a>, ideally into <strong>CSV form</strong> for data analysis in Excel</p>\n\n<p>As an example the current <em>Australian Big Bash 2011/12 scorecards</em> are available from</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Game 1: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524915.html\">http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524915.html</a>  </li>\n<li>Last Game: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524935.html\">http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524935.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I am proficient in using VBA (either automating <code>IE</code> or using <code>XMLHTTP</code> and then using regular expressions) to scrape data from websites, ie \n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/8776484/641067\">Extract values from HTML TD and Tr</a></p>\n\n<p>In that same question a comment was posted suggesting html parsing - which I hadn't come accross before - so I have taken a look at questions such as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags\">RegEx match open tags except XHTML self-contained tags</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Query</strong></p>\n\n<p>While I could write a regex to parse the cricket data below I would like advice as to how I could efficiently retrieve these results with html parsing.</p>\n\n<p>Please bear in mind that my preference is a repeatable CSV format containing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the date/name of the match</li>\n<li>Team 1 name </li>\n<li>the output should dump up to 11 records for Team 1 (blank records where players haven't batted, ie <em>\"Did Not Bat\"</em>)</li>\n<li>Team 2 name </li>\n<li>the output should dump up to 11 records for Team 2 (blank records where players haven't batted)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nirvana for me would be a solution that I could deploy using VBA or VBscript so I could fully automate my analyis but I presume I will have to use a separate tool for the html parse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sample Site links and Data to be Extracted</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mCyrW.png\" alt=\"cricinfo scorecard\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vxIXT.png\" alt=\"source date\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":61,"score":-3,"question_id":13214112,"title":"Why html source is different when I opened it from web browser and read it in Java?","body":"<p>I have a question about parsering online html page.</p>\n\n<p>when I open html source from a web browser, I can see the data in there. </p>\n\n<p>But when I read this html page from java.

Now this is solvable as I have shown for air temperature in code example. <strong>But get this</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>When the air temperature is for example 55°F, it prints only 55. There is no decimal zero after fixed value. The same goes for wind speed. The values that can have decimal point value are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wind speed 10min average</li>\n<li>Wind speed (mph)</li>\n<li>Inside Temperature (°F)</li>\n<li>Outside Temperature (°F)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there are 4^2 = 16 combinations of different file structure.

My original thought was to use sed or similar utility with regex, but reading some of the replies here for other HTML parsing questions it seems that there might be a better solution.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I was facing with the regex was a lack of support for detecting if the string I wanted to match: <code>(src|href|action)=[\"']/</code> was in <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> tags or not, so that I could then either perform string concatenation if the match was in PHP tags, or add in new PHP tags should it not be. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(1) &lt;img id=\"icon-loader-small\" src=\"/css/images/loader-small.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle; display:none;\"/&gt;\n(2) &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"name\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;loggedInAs()?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;a href=\"/Login/logout\"&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n(3) &lt;?php echo ($watched_dir-&gt;getExistsFlag())?\"\":\"&lt;span class='ui-icon-alert'&gt;&lt;img src='/css/images/warning-icon.png'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\"?&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo $watched_dir-&gt;getDirectory();?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"ui-icon ui-icon-close\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n(EDIT: 4) &lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"/Preference/stream-setting\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" onsubmit=\"return confirm('&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;confirm_pypo_restart_text ?&gt;');\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In (1) there a <code>src=\"/css</code>, and as it is not in PHP tags I want that to become <code>src=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/css</code>. In (2), there is a PHP tag but it is not around the <code>href=\"/Login</code>, so it also becomes <code>href=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/Login</code>.\nUnfortunately, (3) has <code>src='/css</code> but <em>inside</em> the PHP tags (it is an echoed string). It is also quoted by <code>\"</code> in the PHP code, so the modification needs to pick up on that too. The final result would look something like: <code>src='\".$baseUrl.\"/css</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All the other modifications to my HTML and PHP files have been done using a regex (I know, I know...). If regexes could support matching everything except a certain pattern, like <code>[^(&lt;\\?php)(\\?&gt;)]*</code> then I would be flying through this part. Unfortunately it seems that this is Type 2 grammar territory. So - what should I use?\nIdeally it needs to be installed by default with the GNU suite, but other tools like PHP itself or other interpreters are fine too, just not preferred. Of course, if someone could structure a regex that would work on the above examples, then that would be excellent.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: (4) is the nasty match, where most regexes will fail.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","parsing","beautifulsoup"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13202087,"title":"Beautiful Soup find children for particular div","body":"<p>I have am trying to parse a webpage that looks like this with Python->Beautiful Soup:<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EYqXD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to extract the contents of the highlighted td div.

My code is below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def errors():\n\n    numExtrapolation,opExtrapolation=parse(expression)\n    if (len(numExtrapolation) == 3) and (len(opExtrapolation) !=2):\n        print(\"Bad1\")\n    if (len(numExtrapolation) ==2) and (len(opExtrapolation) !=1):\n        print(\"Bad2\")\n\n\ndef parse(expression):\n    operators= set(\"*/+-\")\n    opExtrapolate= []\n    numExtrapolate= []\n    buff=[]\n    for i in expression:\n        if i in operators:\n            numExtrapolate.append(''.join(buff))\n            buff= []\n            opExtrapolate.append(i)\n            opExtrapolation=opExtrapolate\n        else:\n            buff.append(i)\n    numExtrapolate.append(''.join(buff))\n    numExtrapolation=numExtrapolate\n    #just some debugging print statements\n    print(numExtrapolation)\n    print(\"z:\", len(opExtrapolation))\n    return numExtrapolation, opExtrapolation\n\n    errors()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated. Please don't introduce new code that is any more advanced than the code already here. I am looking for a solution to my problem... not large new code segments.

Searching the Internet hasn't really yielded much results, everyone has a different way and different process usually geared towards their own Web Service making it a one time use type of solution. Basically, below is the response that I get from a Web Service</p>\n\n<pre><code>anyType{\n schema=anyType{\n  element=anyType{\n   complexType=anyType{\n    choice=anyType{\n     element=anyType{\n      complexType=anyType{\n       sequence=anyType{\n        element=anyType{}; \n           element=anyType{}; \n            element=anyType{}; \n              element=anyType{}; }; }; }; }; }; }; };   \n      diffgram=anyType{\n         NewDataSet=anyType{\n          Rep_x0020_Information=anyType{\n            Login=CorrectLogin; Password=InCorrectPass; }; }; }; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And basically I want to be able to parse out just the two important fields (Login and Password). From what I read I tried just iterating through the SoapObject response based on the property count but that doesn't seem to work.

I need them to be able to go to a 'send email' page, where they can select a lead, or multiple leads, by name.  Then there is a subject field, and a message field so they can write the email, and then I have a 'send email' form submit button.  After they click 'send email' I want to get back the email addresses and names of the leads they selected, for later use.  I need to have the email addresses separated by commas, so that I can send them through a php mail function...  But the important thing is, I want the info from the form to be stored in a database table called 'PendingEmails', and I am going to run a cron job to run a script that finds what emails need to be sent, and sends them...  After an email is sent, I need to put the names, subject, and message from the email in a separate database, called 'SentEmails'.  On a different page on the site, I want the users to be able to see all the emails they sent, but I want them to see the names of who they sent it to, rather than the email addresses.  This is why I need both the names and the emails.  I need emails for the mail function, and names to be displayed back to the user.

Please help, thank you.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is the XML file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;allSkis&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;1&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Kastle&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;BMX 88&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;Built on a versatile 88mm platform the BMX 88 is both very quick edge to edge with the ability to rip arcs down groomers and hardpacked and wide enough to float over crud and light powder with grace and control. With a full vertical sidewall and tip to tail wood core the BMX 88 has the makings of a powerful and unruly ski but has Kastle has seemed to tame the 88 down where it prefers smooth and driving arcs with a seemingly effortless transition edge to edge. When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88. For the skier that wants off piste versatility but splits time evenly between hard and soft snow the BMX 88 is a ski that can handle the workload with a level of grace and ease you would expect from a top end small ski builder.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;2&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Line&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Blend&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;A NEW BLEND OF ALL YOUR FAVORITE FREESTYLE SKIS. The Blend is completely re-designed to be over 10% lighter thanks to our new innovative core, thinner tips, and capwall construction. The reduced swing weight feels like you don't have skis on your feet for floating pillow lines like a pro, ninja-like agility in the trees, and maching switch runs on the way to the park like you never left it. Anywhere, any day, any condition, any terrain, it's the Blend.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;3&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Rossignol&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;S3&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;The S3 is an all-mountain powder ski with an award-winning blend of versatility and float. Featuring narrower dimensions and more traditional tail-shape than the S7, the S3 delivers increased agility and all-mountain versatility. Powder Turn Rocker delivers fatigue-free manueverability, effortless steering and instant speed control, making powder skiing easier and more fun. Centered Sidecut provides the all-terrain versatility and edging power simply not found in other wide-waisted, rockered skis. Explore in-bounds and sidecountry stashes on the S3, the award-winning all-mountain powder ski. &lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Here is the .m file, but I dont have anything in it, as I can find the correct way to do it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"ViewController.h\"\n#import \"TouchXML.h\"\n\n@interface ViewController ()\n\n@end\n\n@implementation ViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n//  and we print our results\n[super viewDidLoad];\n// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\n}\n\n-(IBAction)skiRightPressed:(id)sender {\n//here is my main action (when a button is pressed)\n}\n\n- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning\n{\n[super didReceiveMemoryWarning];\n// Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n"},{"tags":["json","jsp","browser","object","parsing"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":4817,"score":0,"question_id":829643,"title":"processing json objects in jsp","body":"<p>i have a JSON object sent from the browser to the jsp page. how do i receive that object and process it in jsp. do i need any specific parsers? i have used the following piece of code. but it wouldnt work. essentially i should read the contents of the object and print them in the jsp. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%@page language=\"java\" import=\"jso.JSONObject\"%&gt;\n\n&lt;%\nJSONObject inp=request.getParameter(\"param1\");\n%&gt;\n\n&lt;% for(int i=0;i&lt;inp.size();i++)\n{%&gt;\n    &lt;%=inp.getString(i)%&gt;\n&lt;%\n}\n%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","parsing","scalability","parse.com"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":394,"score":2,"question_id":11283729,"title":"How scalable is Parse?","body":"<p>I've been considering using Parse.com's service for my backend, but I'm skeptical about its scalability.</p>\n\n<p>Can it <em>really</em> handle several thousand simultaneous users?

I'm looking to list ONLY the first h1 tags in each partial.  The methods to accomplish this task could probably be modified to grab other elements as well.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I use ruby to open each file, print out the first few characters, close file, and repeat.  My ruby file parsing skills are limiting me.  Here's the code I have at the moment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;% Dir[\"app/views/partials/show/*.html.erb\"].each do |f1| %&gt;\n        &lt;% aFile = File.open(f1, \"r\") %&gt;\n        &lt;% if aFile %&gt;\n            &lt;% content = aFile.sysread(20) %&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= content %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;% else %&gt;\n            &lt;%= \"Unable to open file!\" %&gt;\n        &lt;% end %&gt;\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also think I'm opening the entire partial in memory?

Again I'm only reading first 20 characters because I haven't yet grasped a way to search for the first h1 tag.</p>\n\n<p>I'll make edits as I work through the open, parse, piece... I appreciate any guidance and direction you can offer. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nBased on comments below there may be a far better way to accomplish my task.  So I'm providing some additional background to get direction on other solutions.</p>\n\n<p>This is for a slide show based on partials in a directory.  The slide show is controlled with a navigation element  which I would like to populate by the h1 tags in the partials.  I'm not going to manually enter these things every time a change is made!  I want the end user to simply drag and drop partials into a directory (with a certain name convention and h1 tag description for navigation) and let the slide show do everything else.</p>\n\n<p>I could impose a class on the h1 tag \"forNavigation\" and on the content \"sliderContent\" and then use jquery to create a post load <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> but that doesn't seem right.  Plus they'll all be part of the same rendered div.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I'm not clear why reading the first 50 characters of a partial, copying whats in the h1 tags, and putting it in a  isn't the most elegant solution?</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, above does everything needed except copy and print whats between the first h1 tag... With an xml parser or some regexp it'll be done.  I'm just no good with parsing files.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know other methods to approach this.  Right now I still think it's best to parse the partial (with or without rendering) and put what I need where I want it as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":13144524,"title":"sending post with Java","body":"<p>I have a bash script when I logged in a web page to then parse the html.

I understand the fundamentals of how to do this but am having trouble implementing the ParseTree class.

The actual work happens in the function <i>parseSkedTable()</i>, please concentrate on this one. Also, I would like to point out the term \"double courses\" appearing in the comments, which describes two different courses happening at the same time (the class would be split in such moments).

Since JavaScript (being especially powerful here because of the ability to use browser-rendered data) seems to be the only efficient way to retrieve reliable information from the HTML, I am now looking for a way to implement some kind of headless browser or rendering engine on my free server at x10hosting.com. Sadly, I am neither able to install software other than provided by <a href=\"http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">softaculous</a> nor allowed to use PHP's <em>exec()</em> command.<br>\nAny idea would be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of completeness, I'll post both solutions, existing until now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/3t2A8/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery parser</a> <em>by Pierre Dubois</em>: </p>\n\n<p>(function ($) {\n    $(document).ready(function() {</p>\n\n<pre><code>    var _pe = window.pe || {\n        fn : {}\n    };\n\n    var tblNumber = 0; // Just a incremental number to identify the schedule item with the table\n\n    // For each table\n    $('table').each(function () {\n\n        $('#output').append('Parsing the table number: ' + tblNumber + '&lt;br&gt;');\n        // console.log('Parsing the table number: ' + tblNumber);\n        tblNumber += 1;\n\n        var currentTable = this;\n\n\n        // Parser the complex table\n        _pe.fn.parsertable.parse($(currentTable));\n\n        // Retrieve the parsed data\n        var parsedData = $(currentTable).data().tblparser;\n\n        //\n        // Information about the column structure, nice that is consistent\n        //\n\n        // Day: Cell index position (0 based)\n        // Mo: 3\n        // Di: 7\n        // Mi: 11\n        // Do: 15\n        // Fr: 19\n        // Sa: 23\n\n        // Title Location at Row index position \"0\"\n\n        // \"i\" represent the middle column position\n        for (var i = 3; i &lt; 24; i += 4) {\n\n            var currentDay;\n\n            // Get the day\n            currentDay = $(parsedData.row[0].cell[i].elem).text();\n\n            $('#output').append('  Day: ' + currentDay + '&lt;br&gt;');\n            // console.log('Day: ' + currentDay);\n\n            // Get all the events for that day, excluding the first row and the last row\n            for (var j = 1; j &lt; parsedData.col[i].cell.length - 2; j += 1) {\n\n                // First column \n                if (parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].uid ) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Second Column\n                if (parsedData.col[i].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid &amp;&amp;\n                    parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].uid !== parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Third Column\n                if (parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].uid &amp;&amp;\n                    parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid !== parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].uid) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n            } \n\n        }\n\n    });\n\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}(jQuery));</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/W9Zhw/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JS parser using positional\n    information</a> <em>by me, realizing rambo\n    coder's idea</em>  </p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","optimization","syntax-highlighting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":1,"question_id":13051069,"title":"Live syntax-highlighting parser for large files","body":"<p>I'm familiar with parser generators and the basics of parsers processing a stream all at once from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>My question is for situations like syntax-highlighting text editors.

Since the <code>case class Var</code> class declaration is missing its closing brace you would think the compiler would tell you that the opening brace for that declaration (on line 11) is missing its closing brace. However, <code>scalac</code> reports that it \"assumes\" a missing closing brace in the middle of a previous <code>case class</code> declaration (on line 7). (The full error output is included at the bottom of the posted code.)</p>\n\n<p>Most <code>scalac</code> error messages make sense if you understand the internals of the language, but I'm at a total loss here. How does a missing closing brace in a later class declaration end up propagating to an already successfully parsed class definition earlier in the file?</p>\n\n<p>How on earth do you go about explaining this to a Scala beginner? Leaving off a closing brace is exactly the kind of mistake someone new to Scala might commonly do, but the error message here seems like it would lead the user so far astray that it would probably be more helpful to just report something like <code>error: you seem to be missing a '}' somewhere</code> instead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: I know the usual answer to questions like this is just \"use an IDE and the incremental compilation will flag it right away\" or \"syntax highlighting should make this error obvious\"—but my question is asking specifically about the <code>scalac</code> output, so please keep in mind that I know those are valid points but I really just want to understand what is going on with the compiler here.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n\n<p>Let me try a different approach to explaining my confusion. The error stems from a missing closing brace, so it's obviously a problem with brace nesting. Transforming the text (code) in the snippet I posted to a series of line-number+brace pairs we get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1{ 4}\n6{ 9}\n11{ 12{ 15}\n    19{ 22}\n    24{ 26}\n    28{ 33}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We obviously have a missing closing brace. I could understand <code>scalac</code> guessing the missing brace could go in any one of these places (each represented by an <code>x</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>1{ 4}\n6{ 9}\n11{ x 12{ x 15} x &lt;-- HERE OR HERE OR HERE\n      19{ x 22} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n      24{ x 26} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n      28{ x 33} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this is what the output from <code>scalac</code> says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   +----- I THINK YOU ARE MISSING A\n   |      CLOSING BRACE RIGHT HERE!\n1{ V 4}\n6{ x 9} \n11{ 12{ 15}\n    19{ 22}\n    24{ 26}\n    28{ 33}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That part of the input is already well-nested! How could adding another closing brace there possibly make any sense?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I feel like I should reiterate my main question again: <em>How would you go about explaining this error message (and how to find the root of the error in the source) to a newcomer to Scala?</em></p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","parsing","types","json.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":129,"score":3,"question_id":10520144,"title":"JSON.NET - Can I hint types in XML to be parsed?","body":"<p>When I parse XML using JsonConvert.SerializeXNode or JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNode the following code</p>\n\n<pre><code>XElement person = XElement.Parse(@\"\n  &lt;person&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Palle&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;true&lt;/member&gt;\n  &lt;/person&gt;\");\n\nstring json = JsonConvert.SerializeXNode(person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>give me this json result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"person\":{\"name\":\"Palle\",\"member\":\"true\"}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here member is typed as a string, I would like this to be typed as a bool.

As an exercise I'm trying to write my own JSON parser in the PARSE dialect.</p>\n\n<p>Since Douglas Crockford <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=780554\" rel=\"nofollow\">credits influence of Rebol on his discovery of JSON</a>, I thought it would be easy.  Outside of replacing braces with brackets and getting rid of all those commas, one of the barriers to merely using <code>LOAD</code> on the string is the fact that when they want to do the equivalent of a <code>SET-WORD!</code> they use something that looks like a string to Rebol's tokenizer, with an illegal stray colon after it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"key one\": {\n         \"summary\": \"This is the string content for key one's summary\",\n         \"value\": 7\n    },\n    \"key two\": {\n         \"summary\": \"Another actually string, not supposed to be a 'symbol'\",\n         \"value\": 100\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically I wanted to find all the cases that were like <code>\"foo bar\":</code> and turn them into <code>foo-bar:</code> while leaving matching quote pairs that were not followed by colons alone.</p>\n\n<p>When I tackled this in PARSE (which I understand rather well in principle but still haven't used much) a couple of questions came up.  But mainly, what are the promised conditions under which when you can escape into code and modify the series out from under the parser...specifically in Rebol 3?  More generally, is it the <em>\"right kind of tool for the job\"</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Here was the rule I tried, that appears to work for this part of the task:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>any [\n    ; require a matched pair of quotes &amp; capture series positions before\n    ; and after the first quote, and before the last quote\n\n    to {\"} beforePos: skip startPos: to {\"} endPos: skip\n\n    ; optional colon next (if not there the rest of the next rule is skipped)\n\n    opt [\n        {:}\n\n        ; if we got to this part of the optional match rule, there was a colon.\n        ; we escape to code changing spaces to dashes in the range we captured\n\n        (\n            setWordString: copy/part startPos endPos\n            replace/all setWordString space \"-\"\n            change startPos setWordString\n        )\n\n        ; break back out into the parse dialect, and instead of changing the \n        ; series length out from under the parser we jump it back to the position\n        ; before that first quote that we saw\n\n        :beforePos\n\n        ; Now do the removals through a match rule.

Is there any chance of the <code>change startPos setWordString</code> in the open code mucking up the outer parse...if not in this case, then in something subtly different?</p>\n\n<p>As always, any didactic <em>\"it's cleaner/shorter/better this other way\"</em> advice is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> why isn't there a <code>replace/all/part</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","xml","parsing","zip"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":12983365,"title":"Explain parsing xml and element trees","body":"<p>I was asked to interpret some of this code and am still very new to Python and programming.

My parser is in fact already complete, but at present is a mess of <code>switch</code>...<code>case</code> statements and the focus of my question is how I can refactor this using a nice OO approach.</p>\n\n<p>First, here's an example to illustrate what I'm doing overall.

It's awkward to use from Obj-C, and I expect it will be terribly awkward from a language that doesn't have compile-link-run as part of its standard operating procedure.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking for is something that will pass the \"inline-online-universal\" test.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>(inline) You can write the notation inline with your other code, as you would with a regex..</p></li>\n<li><p>(online) You can run the resulting parser just as you would your other code, which would mean right after input to a REPL in the case of something like Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>(universal) You can move to a different language/platform and use virtually the same code for your parser, modulo dialect differences. In reality, I'd be happy with something that works from Python, Ruby, C, Java, and Haskell.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Most tools I know of fall down at \"online\". They preprocess a grammar offline and spit out code in the target language (C, Python, Java, C++…). They're standalone tools that aren't themselves integrated into the language environment.</p>\n\n<p>I've had suggestions of PEG parsers and lex/yacc combos. Parser combinator libraries might also be a good fit. Whatever you might propose, I'd like to see demonstrated that it meets these tests. Your answer should demonstrate that the proposed solution meets the inline-online-universal requirements by providing a working demo parser in Python, C, and Haskell. The demo example is up to the author, but it should be something painful using just regexen but trivial using a proper parser.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","json","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":12965501,"title":"Parse JSON redirect to Init point Ruby","body":"<p>With this code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>result = JSON.parse(mp_data.to_json)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I got the follow JSON saved at result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"payment_methods\"=&gt;{}, \"init_point\"=&gt;\"https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/checkout/pay?pref_id=126967384-e4abf2e6-79c5-47c6-8c0d-fce045278336\", \"collector_id\"=&gt;126967384, \"back_urls\"=&gt;{\"failure\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/failure\", \"pending\"=&gt;\"https://www.site.com/pending\", \"success\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/success\"}, \"sponsor_id\"=&gt;nil, \"expiration_date_from\"=&gt;nil, \"additional_info\"=&gt;\"\", \"marketplace_fee\"=&gt;0, \"date_created\"=&gt;\"2012-10-18T19:46:13.791-04:00\", \"subscription_plan_id\"=&gt;nil, \"id\"=&gt;\"126967384-e4abf2e6-79c5-47c6-8c0d-fce045278336\", \"expiration_date_to\"=&gt;nil, \"expires\"=&gt;false, \"external_reference\"=&gt;\"OPERATION-ID-14288\", \"payer\"=&gt;{\"email\"=&gt;\"buyer@email.com\", \"name\"=&gt;\"John\", \"surname\"=&gt;\"Mikel\"}, \"items\"=&gt;[{\"id\"=&gt;\"123\", \"currency_id\"=&gt;\"ARS\", \"title\"=&gt;\"Example T-Shirt\", \"picture_url\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/image/123.png\", \"description\"=&gt;\"Red XL T-Shirt\", \"quantity\"=&gt;1, \"unit_price\"=&gt;10.5}], \"client_id\"=&gt;\"963\", \"marketplace\"=&gt;\"NONE\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I make a \"redirect_to\" call to the \"init_point\" url??</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","json","parsing","url","object"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":1,"question_id":12965203,"title":"How to get JSON from webpage into Python script","body":"<p>Got the following code in one of my scripts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#\n# url is defined above.\n#\njsonurl = urlopen(url)\n\n#\n# While trying to debug, I put this in:\n#\nprint jsonurl\n\n#\n# Was hoping text would contain the actual json crap from the URL, but seems not...\n#\ntext = json.loads(jsonurl)\nprint text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially what I want to do is get the {{.....etc.....}} stuff that I see on the URL when I load it in Firefox into my script so I can parse a value out of it.

This probably refers to growing plants in spring. April begins on the same day of week as July in all years and also January in leap years.\n\nApril's flower is the Sweet Pea. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\n\n== April in poetry ==\n\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter. For example: April showers bring May flowers.\n\n== Events in April ==\n\n[[August]]\n\nAugust is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days, the same number of days as the previous month, July, and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.\n\n== The Month ==\n\nThis month was first called Sextilis in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.\n\nAugust is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month.  The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September.\n\nAugust, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other. In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere. In a common year, no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in leap years, February starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as November.\n\nAugust's flower is the Gladiolus with the birthstone being peridot. The astrological signs for August are Leo (July 24 - August 22) and Virgo (August 23 - September 23).\n\n== August observances ==\n\n=== Fixed observances and events ===\n\n=== Moveable and Monthlong events ===\n\n== Selection of Historical Events ==\n\n== References ==\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>April and August are both wiki articles.

Depending on this information I want the parser to build objects which have simple attributes but also complex ones like a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> (space separated), for example <code>Thing</code>s:</p>\n\n<h2>Example data type</h2>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.List;\n\npublic class Thing {\n    protected int           foo;\n    protected String        bar\n    protected List&lt;String&gt;  baz;\n\n    public Thing(int foo, String bar, List&lt;String&gt; baz) {\n        this.foo = foo;\n        this.bar = bar;\n        this.baz = baz;\n    }\n\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"foo: \" + foo + \", bar: \" + bar + \", baz: \" + baz;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The parser's input will be text files with a column line (comma separated) in the first line and the data in the <code>n</code> next lines (comma separated). To simplify testing, I will use <code>Iterator&lt;String&gt;</code> for input lines. This simple test should illustrate what I want to build:</p>\n\n<h2>JUnit test</h2>\n\n<pre><code>// prepare example string iterator\nList&lt;String&gt; lines = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nlines.add(\"bar,baz,foo\");\nlines.add(\"yay,quux quuux,17\");\nlines.add(\"hey,qaax qaaax,42\");\n\n// test parsed things\nList&lt;Thing&gt; things = ThingBuilder.buildThings(lines.iterator());\nassertNotNull(things);\nassertEquals(2, things.size());\nassertEquals(\"foo: 17, bar: yay, baz: [quux, quuux]\", things.get(0).toString());\nassertEquals(\"foo: 42, bar: hey, baz: [qaax, qaaax]\", things.get(1).toString());\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Easiest approach</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>read the first line and split it in column names</li>\n<li>read all other lines and do the following with them:\n<ul>\n<li>split the line in tokens</li>\n<li>loop over them:\n<ul>\n<li>for token <code>i</code> do a big <code>switch</code>/<code>else if</code> on column name <code>i</code> to</li>\n<li>transform token <code>i</code></li>\n<li>store the extracted value somewhere</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>collect everything and build a <code>Thing</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My problem with this approach is the inner switch.

It looks like Boost.Format has really solved the output problem in a good way, but I haven't found anything similarly succinct for input.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","xml","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":12835558,"title":"I was learning xml parser following the android guide, but the sample project prompts error, what could be the reason?","body":"<p>here is the link <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/xml.html</a> , the sample code is at the right for downloading. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I am using wi-fi connection, some ppl suggest disable the LAN card, and i did so, still exceptions... and all the project related to read xml do not work on my emulator.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>it prompt me this error</strong> </p>\n\n<pre><code>10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfo{com.example.android.networkusage/com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity}: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1983)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2084)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.access$600(ActivityThread.java:130)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1195)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4745)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:786)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:553)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.findClass(BaseDexClassLoader.java:61)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:501)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:461)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.Instrumentation.newActivity(Instrumentation.java:1053)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1974)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  ... 11 more\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":201,"score":0,"question_id":9045401,"title":"JParsec bug in parsing simple String expressions","body":"<p>I need a parser for my java application, so I discovered the JParsec library and went through a tutorial on their website with a simple calculator grammar.

The raw template that the above is produced from is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Portland, Indiana\n|native_name              = \n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = \n|image_skyline            = BlueBridge.jpg\n|imagesize                = 250px\n|image_caption            = Meridian (arch) Bridge in the fog\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = \n|image_map                = Jay_County_Indiana_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Portland_Highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location in the state of [[Indiana]]\n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             = \n|coordinates_display      = inline,title\n|coordinates_region       = US-IN\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of countries|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = [[United States]]\n|subdivision_type1        = [[Political divisions of the United States|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Indiana]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Indiana|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Jay County, Indiana|Jay]]\n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Randy Geesaman ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n|leader_title1            = &lt;!-- for places with, say, both a mayor and a city manager --&gt;\n|leader_name1             = \n|leader_title2            = \n|leader_name2             = \n|leader_title3            = \n|leader_name3             = \n|established_title        = &lt;!-- Settled --&gt;\n|established_date         = \n|established_title2       = &lt;!-- Incorporated (town) --&gt;\n|established_date2        = \n|established_title3       = &lt;!-- Incorporated (city) --&gt;\n|established_date3        = \n|area_magnitude           = 1 E7\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 4.65\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 4.65\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0.00\n|area_water_percent       = 0\n|area_urban_sq_mi         = \n|area_metro_sq_mi         = \n|population_as_of         = 2010\n|population_note          = \n|population_total         = 6223\n|population_density_km2   = 604.7\n|population_density_sq_mi = 1566.8\n|population_metro         = \n|population_density_metro_km2     = \n|population_density_metro_sq_mi   = \n|population_urban                 = \n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|latd = 40 |latm = 26 |lats = 2 |latNS = N\n|longd = 84 |longm = 58 |longs = 48 |longEW = W\n|elevation_m              = 277\n|elevation_ft             = 909\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 47371\n|website                  = http://www.thecityofportland.net\n|area_code                = [[Area code 260|260]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 18-61236{{GR|2}}\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0441471{{GR|3}}\n|footnotes                = \n}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To get the results, I first get the template infomation into a dictionary with this function.

Any suggestions are welcome, like I said I'm new to python and I'm sure there are better ways to do what I'm doing.</p>\n\n<p>The results from this function is a dictionary that represents the template, the values are still a mess of free form text. I pass the dictionary to the next function. This is the one I would like most of the advice on - It's a mess and needs cleaned up. The <code>if</code>s and the <code>replace</code>s are all over the place. Before I go and clean that up I was hoping to get any advice or suggestions on other more python ways of doing things.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"\"\"Parse the Infobox settlement template\"\"\"\ndef __parseInfoboxSettlement(self):\n    values = self.__getTemplate(\"Infobox settlement\")\n    settlement = {}\n    settlement['WIKI'] = self.title\n    if values == None:\n        return settlement\n\n    # Get the settlement established date\n    if 'established_date' in values:\n        if 'established_date2' not in values:\n            settlement['ESTABLISHED_DATE'] = self.__parseDate(values['established_date'])\n        else:\n            if len(values['established_date']) &gt;

Basically, I would like to use top-down parsing everywhere except individual statements. The reason for this is order of operations- its a lot easier to implement them with a bottom up, and it is a lot easier to implement everything else with a top-down parser.</p>\n\n<p>The actual implementation of this is as follows: Start with top-down parsing, matching like normal. Then, in one of the rules, there is a rule that is marked as \"bottom-up\". <code>X</code> tokens are taken out of the input lex array, \"crunched\" with bottom-up (aka shift-reduce) into a single token, and that token is placed into the top-down match. The top-down continues on its way with the rest of its match.</p>\n\n<p>My problem/question is how to get this number <code>X</code>. How many tokens do I take out of the input token stream to shift-reduce on? My initial solution was simple- take them until a semicolon is reached. However, what about things like if statements? There is no semicolon at the ends of those expressions.</p>\n\n<p>I'll give an example to my original plan, because it probably just sounds like gibberish. Say the grammar set is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(top-down) statement ::= &lt;expression&gt; \";\"\n(bottom-up) expression =\n    multiplication ::= &lt;number&gt; \"*\" &lt;number&gt;\n    addition ::= &lt;number&gt; \"+\" &lt;number&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then it would reduce like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>3 + 4 * 2 ;\n((bottom-up) 3 + 4 * 2) ;\n    3 + 4 * 2\n    3 + multiplication\n    addition\naddition ;\nstatement\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem, again, is how do I get the number of tokens to shift-reduce?

For example, I have a file which contais a table like this (7 colums: the first two always have data, only one Complexity column has data, only one Financing column has data):</p>\n\n<pre><code>+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| AIH | Value | Complexity                     | Financing       |\n|     |       | Medium | High | Not applicable | MAC/Other | FAE |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| xyz | 12.43 | 12.34  |      |                | 12.34     |     |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| abc | 1.56  |        | 1.56 |                |           | 1.56|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I use PDFBox:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(pathToFile);\nPDFTextStripper s = new PDFTextStripper();\nString content = s.getText(document);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Those two line data would be extracted like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xyz 12.43 12.4312.43\nabc 1.56 1.561.56\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are no white spaces between the last two numbers, but this is not the biggest problem. The problem is that I don't know what the last two numbers mean: Medium, High, Not applicable? MAC/Other, FAE? I don't have the relation between the numbers and their columns.</p>\n\n<p>It is not required for me to use the PDFBox library, so a solution that uses another library is fine. What I want is to be able to parse the file and know what each number parse means.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","compiler","types","code-generation","semantic-analysis"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":1,"question_id":8184386,"title":"compilers - Instruction Selection for type declarations in AST","body":"<p>I'm learning compilers and creating a code generator for a simple language that deals with two types: characters and integers. </p>\n\n<p>After the user input has been scanned by the scanner and then parsed by the parser, I get an AST representation of the input.

I have my own simple translation script which is called like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(\"Name\"); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It would return (and echo) a string with a keyword 'Name'. The problem is, for several reasons (name: misstranslations, report, development, translation in situ), I might want to retrieve all strings' keywords that are on a page. A simple page (example.com/campus/index.php) looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(Campus); ?&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify;\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(126); ?&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify;\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(129); ?&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php $Link-&gt;create(\"campus/about\"); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=\"bodymenu\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(About); ?&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify;\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(146); ?&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php $Link-&gt;create(\"campus/learning_center\"); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=\"bodymenu\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(Learning_center); ?&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify;\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(147); ?&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php $Link-&gt;create(\"campus/residence\"); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=\"bodymenu\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(Residence); ?&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify;\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(128); ?&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I would like to obtain in some situations: <code>$Translations=array(\"Campus\",\"126\",\"129\",\"About\",\"146\",\"Learning_center\",\"147\",\"Residence\",\"128\");</code> for further processing (EDIT) <strong>from another page</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases there's much more php logic mixed in the page, in some others it's like this.

First would be to parse the php code as is using regex. Since I know the bits that I'm looking for, I thing it would be possible. Second one is that, depending on a SESSION variable, I render the html and parse it, so the <code>echo $Translate-&gt;text(Campus);</code> would return something like <code>&lt;span id=\"Translation\"&gt;Campus&lt;/span&gt;</code> and then parse only the html and retrieve all the ids. Can you think about any other way to retrieve the ids before I get on this?.</p>\n\n<p>PS, I <strong>DON'T</strong> want to hardcode all the id's in an array at the beginning or end of a page.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","parsing","csv"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12653624,"title":"Parsing a remote csv line by line ruby","body":"<p>I've got a remote CSV that updates every few hours, it has 1m+ rows and I'm trying to work out if I can download the file line by line and parse it (I'm only interested in the first 500,000 lines) rather than have to download the whole file then process it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","ios","parsing","instruments","ios-ui-automation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":91,"score":2,"question_id":12276323,"title":"How do I enable Javascript syntax check in Apple Instruments","body":"<p>We are using Apple Instruments to automate some of the Test Flows on iPhone devices.

The size of the responses seem to be reasonable (specially 9.4 KB response). It appears that the SBJsonStreamParser breaks when getting a data stream greater than a certain size. The parser succeeds when the response is small (~3KB), but fails when the response is larger (~10KB). \nI used NSLog to verify that in both cases, pulling a small &amp; large stream, the methods  are successfully receiving the full json document - because it looks like [{\"id\": .... 123}]. I'm convinced that the issue is that the data stream is too long.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if I'm using SBJson incorrectly or is this simply a limitation of the parser? Is there anything that I can configure that allows SBJsonStreamParser to not throw an error for larger (but reasonable) data streams &amp; continue to parse the full response?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","parsing","sorting","recursion"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":0,"question_id":12532670,"title":"recursing a dictionary of lists of dictionaries, etc et al (python)","body":"<p>I have a dictionary returned from a yaml configuration file with 4 levels: </p>\n\n<p>item, sections, fields, elements</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"tag\": \"test\", \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section ONE\", \n            \"tag\": \"s1\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section TWO\", \n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field ONE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f1\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field TWO\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f2\", \n                    \"elements\": [\n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e1\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e2\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e3\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e4\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field THREE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f3\", \n                    \"elements\": [\n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e5\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e6\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e7\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element ONE\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e8\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ], \n            \"tag\": \"s2\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section THREE\", \n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field FOUR\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f4\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field FIVE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f5\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field SIX\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f6\"\n                }\n            ], \n            \"tag\": \"s3\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"type_of\": \"custom\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1> </h1>\n\n<pre><code>class T():\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.sections = []\n        self.fields = []\n        self.elements = []\n\ndef rt(y):\n    t = T()\n\n    def recurse(y):\n        for k,v in y.iteritems(): \n            if isinstance(v, list):\n                getattr(t, k).append(v)\n                [recurse(i) for i in v]\n            else:\n                setattr(t, k, v)\n    recurse(y)\n    return t\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I need to recurse a dictionary of lists of dictionaries that have lists of dictionaries, et. al., sort them into their types (and then add a reference to the piece it belongs to, but one problem at a time.) and put into an instance of T.</p>\n\n<p>This works, but doesn't trim out anything, i.e. each section is captured, but all the rest (fields, elements) are captured.

extension page (or in a new tab) the users then see the \"approve app\" from Facebook</li>\n<li>The user approves the app</li>\n<li>The user is directed to a new page that thanks them for installing and processes all the needed user information  OR  the user is sent back to the google chrome extension (better way)</li>\n<li>If the user is not sent back to the google chrome extension, they should be told to do so, but at this point how to get the data to the google chrome extension?</li>\n<li>The user opens to the Google chrome extension, they should now see \"Hi John\" or similar instead of \"Login with Facebook\"</li>\n<li>The user can no post to Facebook</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My major hick-ups are logging in with Facebook, and getting the data back to the extension.</p>\n\n<p>I've created a Facebook app, done most of the coding specific to the app, I'm trying to keep the app just javascript (but I can add in php if there is no other way), tried using the standard Facebook javascript, and tried using the desktop client for Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else gone through this process of connecting Google Chrome Extensions and Facebook login before?</p>\n\n<p>As a final note, I'm trying

I know: use <a href=\"http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ply</a> or <a href=\"http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyparsing</a> and write a parser and there we go.

Here, I'm trying to enumerate <em>good</em> -- get an AST, allow only a few node types, and then verify that any calls are to one of a set of whitelisted functions. Here's a mini-implementation (and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3759435\" rel=\"nofollow\">a gist</a>):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>import ast\nimport math\n\nSAFE_FX = {\n    'exp': math.exp,\n}\n\nSAFE_NODES = set(\n    (ast.Expression,\n    ast.Num,\n    ast.Call,\n    ast.Name,\n    ast.Load,\n    ast.BinOp,\n    ast.Add,\n    ast.Sub,\n    ast.Mult,\n    ast.Div,)\n)\n\nclass CleansingNodeVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\n    def generic_visit(self, node):\n        if type(node) not in SAFE_NODES:\n            raise Exception(\"%s not in SAFE_NODES\" % type(node))\n        super(CleansingNodeVisitor, self).generic_visit(node)\n\n    def visit_Call(self, call):\n        if call.func.id not in SAFE_FX:\n            raise Exception(\"Unknown function: %s\" % call.func.id)\n\ndef my_safe_eval(s):\n    tree = ast.parse(s, mode='eval')\n    cnv = CleansingNodeVisitor()\n    cnv.visit(tree)\n    compiled = compile(tree, s, \"eval\")\n    return(eval(compiled, SAFE_FX))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, <code>my_safe_eval('2*(4+exp(1.3))')</code> works, while <code>my_safe_eval('[].__class__')</code> tricks and <code>my_safe_eval('open(\"/something/evil\")')</code> is likewise forbidden -- without forbidding <code>__builtins__</code> or <code>__locals__</code> or anything.</p>\n\n<p>I...

Now if I make the app go to the background and then click the app again to resume I call the same method to load the data but this time i send version #'s to the server to only get back objects that have changed,added or deleted since the last pull. This all maps fine but when I go to display these objects I get the same data that was in the first pull. I believe it might be a clearing of the cache problem but i dont know. Help is grateful.  </p>\n\n<p>RKObjectManager* objectManager = [RKObjectManager objectManagerWithBaseURLString:@\"http://link.com\"];\n    objectManager.client.requestQueue.showsNetworkActivityIndicatorWhenBusy = YES;\n    objectManager.objectStore = [RKManagedObjectStore objectStoreWithStoreFilename:@\"34453434.sqlite\"];\n    RKManagedObjectMapping* cliffMapping = [RKManagedObjectMapping mappingForClass:[Cliff class] inManagedObjectStore:objectManager.objectStore];</p>\n\n<pre><code>cliffMapping.primaryKeyAttribute = @\"cliffID\";\ncliffMapping.rootKeyPath = @\"cliffs\";\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"name\" toAttribute:@\"name\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"cliffId\" toAttribute:@\"cliffID\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"description\" toAttribute:@\"cliffDescription\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"notes\" toAttribute:@\"notes\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"city\" toAttribute:@\"city\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"intensity\" toAttribute:@\"intensity\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"latitude\" toAttribute:@\"latitude\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"height\" toAttribute:@\"height\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"longitude\" toAttribute:@\"longitude\"];\n[cliffMapping mapKeyPath:@\"zipcode\" toAttribute:@\"zipcode\"];\n[objectManager.mappingProvider setMapping:cliffMapping forKeyPath:@\"cliffs\"];\n[objectManager.mappingProvider addObjectMapping:cliffMapping];\n\nRKManagedObjectMapping* stateMapping = [RKManagedObjectMapping mappingForClass:[State class] inManagedObjectStore:objectManager.objectStore];\nstateMapping.rootKeyPath = @\"States\";\nstateMapping.primaryKeyAttribute = @\"stateID\";\n[stateMapping mapKeyPath:@\"stateId\" toAttribute:@\"stateID\"];\n[stateMapping mapKeyPath:@\"name\" toAttribute:@\"name\"];\n[stateMapping mapKeyPath:@\"version\" toAttribute:@\"sversion\"];\n[stateMapping mapKeyPath:@\"cliffAmount\" toAttribute:@\"cliffAmount\"];\n[stateMapping mapRelationship:@\"cliffs\" withMapping:cliffMapping];\n[objectManager.mappingProvider setMapping:stateMapping forKeyPath:@\"States\"];\n[objectManager.mappingProvider addObjectMapping:stateMapping];\n[objectManager loadObjectsAtResourcePath:@\"/Application/getEverything\" usingBlock:^(RKObjectLoader *loader){\n    loader.serializationMIMEType = RKMIMETypeJSON;\n    loader.resourcePath = @\"/Application/getEverything\";\n    loader.method = RKRequestMethodPOST;\n    loader.delegate = self;\n    loader.objectMapping = stateMapping;\n}];\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","regex","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"question_id":12468551,"title":"Regexp to find C comments","body":"<p>I need a regexp in Ruby to find the comment before a C instruction.</p>\n\n<p>For example I have this file <code>example.c</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 1\n */\nx = rb_define_class_under (foo, \"MyClassName1\", bar);\n\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 2\n */\ny = rb_define_class_under (foo, \"MyClassName2\", bar);\n\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 3\n */\nz = rb_define_class_under (foo, \"MyClassName3\", bar);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have my parser in ruby <code>parser.rb</code> like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>content = File.open('example.c').read\n\nif content =~ /((?&gt;\\/\\*.*?\\*\\/))([\\w\\.\\s]+\\s=\\s)?rb_define_class_under.*?\"(MyClassName1)\"/m\n  puts \"Comment number 1 is:\"\n  puts $1\nend\n\nif content =~ /((?&gt;\\/\\*.*?\\*\\/))([\\w\\.\\s]+\\s=\\s)?rb_define_class_under.*?\"(MyClassName2)\"/m\n  puts \"Comment number 2 is:\"\n  puts $1\nend\n\nif content =~ /((?&gt;\\/\\*.*?\\*\\/))([\\w\\.\\s]+\\s=\\s)?rb_define_class_under.*?\"(MyClassName3)\"/m\n  puts \"Comment number 3 is:\"\n  puts $1\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the output I expect is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Comment number 1 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 1\n */\nComment number 2 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 2\n */\nComment number 3 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 3\n */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Comment number 1 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 1\n */\nComment number 2 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 1\n */\nComment number 3 is:\n/*\n * COMMENT NUMBER 1\n */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea?

I am looking for languages designed to assist in the dissection/decoding of arbitrary packet formats. Idealy, the solution should be based on open standards. There are related questions on SO, but most deal with the full lifecycle of packet sniffing (I don't care so much about the capture, there are other libraries that do that well).</p>\n\n<p>In general, what I'm looking for is a language and supporting framework for the declaritive definition of packet formats and corresponding run-time decoding. Because this problem can be generalized to any non-network binary data, a solution that does this for arbitrary binary streams would also be in scope. I am a little surprised no such standard currently exists in a mature and robust state (at least that I could find) - though there seem to be a lot of interesting but not-quite-right and almost-there projects (see below). Perhaps that speaks to the difficulty of the problem, or maybe to a lack of demand.</p>\n\n<p>By way of example, I'm interested in technologies and ideas similar to the following (in no particular order):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/packetnet/index.php?title=Main_Page\">Packet.Net</a> - Does the job of converting from binary packet representations to structures, but the dissectors are all hard-coded and it doesn't appear to be able to handle more complex formats.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/dfdl-wg\">DFDL</a> - I've been following this one for a while and was even participating in teleconferences a year or so ago. The standard seems to be reaching maturity, but implementation appears to be challenging. Not that I mind getting my hands dirty, but I'm not sure I've got the resources on this project to implement such a wide-ranging standard from scratch for this purpose.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nmparsers.codeplex.com/\">Network Monitor Open Source Parsers</a> - This project describes packets using a C-like syntax for use by Microsoft Network Monitor. It has a lot of packets already defined and the language appears robust enough to support complex structures. Unfortunately, the only implemention of an execution engine is in NetMon and while the grammar for the language could probably be reverse-engineered, implementing a processing engine might be very difficult. I also worry that because of the explicit tie between the parser language and the NetMon tool there are non-general aspects to the language that would make it inappropriate for uses in other tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nbee.org/doku.php?id=netpdl%3aindex\">NetPDL</a> - This one looks very interesting, but development seems to have languished. It's also not totally clear how to make use of the execution engine outside of their own environment.</li>\n<li>Wireshark Dissectors - I've thought about wrapping/using native Wireshark Dissectors for this purpose, but they are tied pretty closely to Wireshark itself. The dissectors also use code to perform most of the decoding, which is a little counter to what I'm looking for - I'd prefer something that's a little more declaritive (though obviously there's a balance since complex packet structures often require switching and other logic to determine the final makeup).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www2002.org/CDROM/alternate/334/\">BSDL</a> - An academic language similar in concept to DFDL (see above). Interesting and in the right direction, but outside of a couple papers nothing else seems to exist.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not necessarily looking for a complete solution here (though if someone knows of one I haven't covered, that would be great). I'm more interested in comments or anecdotes about the technologies I've indicated above as well as pointers or ideas for routes I haven't thought of or covered.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","file","parsing"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":513,"score":0,"question_id":3286771,"title":"I want to parse multiple strings into variables from a .txt file in java.

This bascially means to find a valid allocation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">AST</a> nodes to grammar production rules. This is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction\">constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)</a> in general and could be solved, like parsing, by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking\">backtracking</a> in O(exp(n)). </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for parsing, this can be done in O(n³) using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLR_parser\">GLR</a> (or better restricting the grammar). Because the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">AST</a> structure is so close to the grammar production rule structure, I was really surprised seeing an implementation where the runtime is worse than parsing: <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/\">XText</a> uses <a href=\"http://www.antlr.org/\">ANTLR</a> for parsing and backtracking for unparsing. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is a context free S-attribute grammar everything a parser and unparser need to share or are there further constraints, e.g. on the parsing technique / parser implementation?</li>\n<li>I've got the feeling this problem isn't O(exp(n)) in general - could some genius help me with this?</li>\n<li>Is this basically a context-sensitive grammar?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Area    returns AnyObject   -&gt; Pedestrian | Highway\nHighway returns AnyObject   -&gt; \"Foo\" Car\nPedestrian  returns AnyObject   -&gt; \"Bar\" Bike\nCar     returns Vehicle     -&gt; anyObjectInstance.name=\"Car\"\nBike    returns Vehicle     -&gt; anyObjectInstance.name=\"Bike\" \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if I have an AST containing</p>\n\n<p><code>AnyObject  -&gt; AnyObject    -&gt; Vehicle [name=\"Car\"]</code>  and I know the root can be Area, I could resolve it to </p>\n\n<pre><code>Area    -&gt; Highway  -&gt; Car\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the (Highway | Pedestrian) decision depends on the subtree decisions. The problem get's worse when a leaf might be, at first sight, one of several types, but has to be a specific one to form a valid path later on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So if I have S-attribute rules returning untyped objects, just assigning some attributes, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>A -&gt; B C   {Obj, Obj}\nX -&gt; Y Z   {Obj, Obj}\nB -&gt; \"somekeyword\"  {0}\nY -&gt; \"otherkeyword\" {0}\nC -&gt; \"C\" {C}\nZ -&gt; \"Z\" {Z}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if an AST contains</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Obj\n  /  \\\n\"0\"  \"C\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can unparse it to </p>\n\n<pre><code>   A\n  / \\\n B   C\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>just after I could resolve \"C\" to C. </p>\n\n<p>While traversing the AST, all constraints I can generate from the grammar are satisfied for both rules, A and X,  until I hit \"C\". This means that for</p>\n\n<pre><code>A -&gt; B | C \nB -&gt; \"map\"  {MagicNumber_42}\nC -&gt; \"foreach\" {MagicNumber_42}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>both solutions for the tree</p>\n\n<pre><code>     Obj\n      |\n MagicNumber_42\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are valid and it is considered that they have equal semantics ,e.g. syntactic sugar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Information:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext//documentation.html#serialization\">unparsing in XText</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext//documentation.html#validation\">grammar constraints for unparsing, see Serializer: Concrete Syntax Validation</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","parsing","culture","countries"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":6,"question_id":12427240,"title":"Processing of mongolian names","body":"<p>There are several countries (Turkey, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan etc.) where generally men's name can be without middlename and instead of it used words like \"oglu, uulu\" etc. </p>\n\n<p>For example \"Michael oglu Bret\" which means \"Michael son of Bret\".</p>\n\n<p>I used to split this kind of words and assume them as a middlename, so for the past week I feel doubts of correctness of the way I do it.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any standardized or some set of rules of how to process this kind of names?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","performance","parsing","mysqli"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":12414990,"title":"Parse a table of analog values","body":"<p>I store the values from some analog registers (0 and 1) to the database and I would like to do the following:</p>\n\n<p>I have the following table in the database for storing the sensors values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ID   |          TIMESTAMP     |  ALIAS  |  STATUS\n 1   |    2012-09-12 12:31:01 |   AR1   |     0\n 2   |    2012-09-12 12:31:02 |   AR1   |     0\n 3   |    2012-09-12 12:31:03 |   AR1   |     0\n 4   |    2012-09-12 12:31:04 |   AR1   |     0\n 5   |    2012-09-12 12:31:05 |   AR1   |     0\n 6   |    2012-09-12 12:31:06 |   AR1   |     0\n 7   |    2012-09-12 12:31:07 |   AR1   |     1\n 8   |    2012-09-12 12:31:08 |   AR1   |     1\n 9   |    2012-09-12 12:31:09 |   AR1   |     1\n10   |    2012-09-12 12:31:10 |   AR1   |     0\n11   |    2012-09-12 12:31:11 |   AR1   |     0\n12   |    2012-09-12 12:31:12 |   AR1   |     0\n13   |    2012-09-12 12:31:13 |   AR1   |     0\n14   |    2012-09-12 12:31:14 |   AR1   |     0\n15   |    2012-09-12 12:31:15 |   AR1   |     1\n16   |    2012-09-12 12:31:16 |   AR1   |     0\n17   |    2012-09-12 12:31:17 |   AR1   |     0\n18   |    2012-09-12 12:31:01 |   AR1   |     0\n ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using an SQL query, I would like to be able to return when the register had changed status in order to create a graph without using unnecessary points.

Parsing out last statement with simple sed script by just looking for last <code>';'</code> was initially good enough for me.\nBut now project is bigger than small personal project and I need a better parser.</p>\n\n<p>Below is mini unit-test for my current SED parser. You can see SED regex which I use to do the parsing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    cat  &lt;&lt;EOF  | sed    's/$//;s/[ \\t]*$//;s/\\(.*[;}]\\)*\\([^;}]\\+$\\)/\\0    ==&gt;&gt;  \\1   PRINT(\\2);/'\n\n\n    print\n    no-print;\n    OK;  print\n    OK;  no-print;\n    OK;  no-print;  print\n    FAIL;   while(a){b;}  no-print\n    FAIL;   while(a)  no-print\n    OK;     for(a;b;c) {no-print}\n    FAIL;   for(a;b;c) no-print\n    OK;     {}\n    OK;     {no-print-code-block;}\n    FAIL;  print_rvalue_t{1}\n    FAIL;   f(int{1})\n    FAIL;   f(\";\")\n    FAIL;   f(';')\n    FAIL;   f(\"}\")\n    EOF\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First line after <code>cat</code>-line is empty line.  Second line is one space  line.\n3rd - statment not terminated with <code>';'</code> - should be printed.  4th - 2-statment\nsnippet. And so on.  If there is <code>FAIL</code> - parser will fail at this line. Output\nlooks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    print   ==&gt;&gt;     PRINT(print);\n    no-print;\n    OK;  print      ==&gt;&gt;  OK;   PRINT(  print);\n    OK;  no-print;\n    OK;  no-print;  print   ==&gt;&gt;  OK;  no-print;   PRINT(  print);\n    FAIL;     while(a){b;}  print     ==&gt;&gt;  OK;       while(a){b;}   PRINT(  no-print);\n    FAIL;   while(a)  no-print      ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;   PRINT(    while(a)  no-print);\n    OK;     for(a;b;c) {no-print}\n    FAIL;   for(a;b;c) no-print     ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;     for(a;b;   PRINT(c) no-print);\n    OK;     {}\n    OK;     {no-print-code-block;}\n    FAIL;  print_rvalue_t{1}\n    FAIL;   f(int{1})       ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;     f(int{1}   PRINT());\n    FAIL;   f(\";\")  ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;     f(\";   PRINT(\"));\n    FAIL;   f(';')  ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;     f(';   PRINT('));\n    FAIL;   f(\"}\")  ==&gt;&gt;  FAIL;     f(\"}   PRINT(\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lines without <code>==&gt;&gt;</code> marker are lines that are passed through parser without modifications.  After marker is transformed snippet, where last statement is wrapped in <code>PRINT( )</code>.\nAs you can see current SED parser is not very good.</p>\n\n<p>So am looking for something better.  I will accept the answer even if it is not\n100% correct at parsing.  Even better SED script would be good enough for me.\nRight way to do it would be probably to use real parser (from something like\nCLANG) but I am a little bit apprehensive of  complexity of this endeavor.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to write a parser in boost/xpressive -  <a href=\"http://github.com/lvv/scc/blob/master/sccpp.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/lvv/scc/blob/master/sccpp.h</a> . Of cause it's not real C++\nparser. It's just a quick hack made just for one thing: parse out last statement.  It is\nable to do all above unit tests.  But unfortunately, for longer snippets it was\nintolerably slow.</p>\n\n<p>Question is: how to make a better parser?</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","xml","parsing","dom","docx"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":2,"question_id":12404663,"title":"problems with child Appending while parsing xml file with DOM parser in Android","body":"<p>I'm trying to parse defined docx file in android to put them in the text field , image view and table layout.\nbut i'm stuck on child apending.</p>\n\n<p>The text file is defined and separated with an known style, who defined the headers from the topic.\nbut all topics are without style defined, and i trying to get them with counting what is betwen two headers and append on correct object,</p>\n\n<p>here is my code but the element is appending on the same object </p>\n\n<p>this is the object code + geters and seters</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ObjectForPassingElements {\n\n    Element name;\n    Element content;\n\n    int position;\n    int order;\n    int parrent;\n    int id;\n}\n\n\npublic List&lt;ObjectForPassingElements&gt; getElementByStyle(Document d,NodeList paragpraphList,String startTag,String tagname,String atribute,String atributeValue)\n{\n\n        Element paragraphElement;\n\n        Element empty = d.createElement(startTag);\n        Element elementWithTagName;\n        List&lt;ObjectForPassingElements&gt; objListWithOutContent = new ArrayList&lt;ObjectForPassingElements&gt;();\n        int start=0;\n        int end = 0;\n        int order = 0;\n\n            for(int i=0;i&lt;paragpraphList.getLength();i++)\n            {\n\n                paragraphElement = (Element) paragpraphList.item(i);\n                //m.compareDocumentPosition(other);\n                NodeList titleStyle = paragraphElement.getElementsByTagName(tagname);\n                ObjectForPassingElements elementWithstyle = new ObjectForPassingElements();\n                for(int j=0;j&lt;titleStyle.getLength();j++)\n                {\n                    elementWithTagName = (Element) titleStyle.item(j);\n\n                    if(elementWithTagName.getAttribute(atribute).equals(atributeValue))\n                    {\n\n                        elementWithstyle.setContent(empty);\n                        elementWithstyle.setName((Element) paragpraphList.item(i));\n                        elementWithstyle.setPosition(i);\n                        elementWithstyle.setOrder(order);\n                        objListWithOutContent.add(elementWithstyle);\n                        order++;\n                        //\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            Element n;\n            Node childBlankNode1 = d.createTextNode(\"\\n\\n\");\n\n        for(int i =0;i&lt;paragpraphList.getLength();i++)\n        {\n            Log.d(\"in\",\"inlist size\"+objListWithOutContent.size()+\"\");\n            for(int k=0;k&lt;objListWithOutContent.size();k++)\n            {\n                start = objListWithOutContent.get(k).getPosition();\n\n                if(k!=objListWithOutContent.size()-1)\n                    end=objListWithOutContent.get(k+1).getPosition();\n                else\n                    end=paragpraphList.getLength()-1;\n\n                if(i&gt;=start&amp;&amp;i&lt;end)\n                {\n                    n =(Element) paragpraphList.item(i);\n                    objListWithOutContent.get(k).getContent().appendChild(n);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        //\n\n        for(ObjectForPassingElements obj : objListWithOutContent)\n        {\n            Log.d(\"fin\",obj.getPosition()+\" --- ///name \"+obj.getName().getTextContent()+\" name/// ---- ///content\"+obj.getContent().getTextContent()+\"///content  \");\n        }\n\n        return objListWithOutContent;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>here is the close example to xml document form docx document</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;w:p&gt;\n&lt;w:pStyle w:val=\"Protocols\"/&gt;&lt;/w:pPr&gt;&lt;w:r w:rsidRPr=\"00E37EC1\"&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;HEADER 1&lt;/w:t&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;\n&lt;/w:p&gt;\n&lt;w:p&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

So the objects are components that make up a final product and have restrictions as to which components or objects can be selected for any given build.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a sample format for a line containing the dependencies that I am trying to write logic for:</p>\n\n<pre><code>objectID_y1234_y1233_n2345\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>objectID</strong> is the id of this object(component) and is a 4 digit number, there is an extremely rare case of it having one letter in the object's id like: 12a4</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>y1234</strong> means this object requires object with id 1234 to be selected to be active.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>y1233</strong> means this object requires object with id 1233 to be selected to be active.</p>\n\n<p>Since y1234 and y1233 share the same first two digits in their ID numbers this creates an or condition.</p>\n\n<p>So this object requires object 1234 or 1233 to be selected instead of both to be selected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>n2345</strong> means this object is not active when object 2345 is selected.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The the first dependency listed always starts with a \"y\" or a \"n\" so you can never have objectID_1234_n2345_y1235, but you can have objectID_y1234_1235_n2345.</p>\n\n<p>Also if the condition is an \"or\" condition you cannot have y1234_n1233, it is either both have y's or both have n's.</p>\n\n<p>Some more of the many possible formats:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><code>objectID_y1234_2345</code><br>\nThis is stating object requires object 1234 and object 2345 to be selected for this object to be active.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>objectID_n1234_2345_y3456</code><br>\nThis states objectID requires 1234 and 2345 to not be selected and 3456 to be selected for this object to be active.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>objectID_n1234_n1233</code><br>\nUnlike y1234_y1233 if n is used the condition is always \"and\" so this means 1234 and 1233 cannot be selected for this object to be active.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Feel free to ask for more information/explanation if something is unclear. I am trying to explain this as clearly as possible because the dependencies can become confusing easily. I did not list all the possible combinations for the statements as they don't have a limit to length, but just consist of longer or multiple \"or\" and \"and\" conditions with object Ids.</p>\n\n<h3>Big Picture of what is going on:</h3>\n\n<p>I have a treeview of objectIDs and when you select one object you have to de-activate the conflicting objects and activate or the ones that can be selected now.</p>\n\n<h3>Purpose of Dependencies:</h3>\n\n<p>The dependencies have to answer two questions...</p>\n\n<p>1: What objects cannot be selected for this object to be active?</p>\n\n<p>2: What objects must be selected for this object to be active?</p>\n\n<h3>My Question/Problem:</h3>\n\n<p>I find that this data is extremely fragile and sometimes objects place dependencies on eachother that de-activate both objects and neither will ever be able to be selected.</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<p>ID1234_y2345</p>\n\n<p>ID2345_y1234</p>\n\n<p>This results in neither 1234 or 2345 being active because at start both are de-activated since the requirements(dependencies) are not met.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has an idea that could change the syntax or format that represents the dependencies I can do that. I just haven't found a alternate way that fits the requirements with out causing more complexity or problems. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I am looking for a way I can approach this and come up with a solution that will work. I have been trying to implement a solution for some time now and all of my attempts have failed so far. I have tried various recursive and non-recursive solutions. I may be wrong, but I almost feel like this is something a neural network could do since I am basically trying to make a computer think for itself here.</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to start with a list of everything I need to do and then implement a solution that fulfills the list, but I end up finding more issues as I go and add to the list so I never am covering all the possibilities and there are probably more I haven't discovered yet. Overall I have been able to de-activate and activate correctly some of the time, but it is not reliable all the time and it needs to be.</p>\n\n<h3>Current Logic</h3>\n\n<p>In the tree the components of the same type share the same 2 leading characters so if 1234,1233, and 1245 are in a group and the user picks 1234 I treat the group like a radio button. So 1234 added to a list tracking the selected components and 1233,1245 are added to another list of disabled components. Then the entire tree is updated by checking each component and making sure it is disabled or enabled depending on if it's requirements are now met. However if I have to disable another component while checking, currently I check the tree all over again which is horribly inefficient because it could keep doing this for a while. I thought recursion might have worked better, but got a mess that was really hard to debug and still had too many issues.</p>\n\n<p>For checking the list of components, I still think recursion is the way because when I select a component I need to disable the other components that are not available then check the components I disabled, and then any components that are disabled because of the ones I disabled and so on...</p>\n\n<p>Example: If I disable 1234 and 1890 requires 1234, I now disable 1890. But now 1770 required 1890 so I disable 1770. Then if something requires 1770 I need to disable that and so on...</p>\n\n<p>All help and suggestions are appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","parsing","date","dateformat","simpledateformat"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":3,"question_id":12396270,"title":"Issue with java DateFormat","body":"<p>Following is a piece of code that I am running.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void testMyMehotd() {\n    String expected = \"2012-09-12T20:13:47.796327Z\";\n    DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS'Z'\");\n    //df.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"UTC\"));\n    Date d = null;\n    try {\n        d = df.parse(expected);\n    } catch (ParseException e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    String actual = df.format(d);\n\n    System.out.println(expected);\n    System.out.println(actual);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but the output is different than what I expect.</p>\n\n<pre><code>expected : 2012-09-12T20:13:47.796327Z\nactual   : 2012-09-12T20:27:03.000327Z\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can someone tell me the reason for this and what is the solution.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","parsing","decimal","nullable"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":12396294,"title":"Decimal value can not be recognized/parsed in my constructor","body":"<p>I am following an example and it has a class that goes like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Price\n{\n\nprivate decimal _sellingPrice;\nprivate decimal _rrp;\n\npublic Price(decimal RRP, decimal SellingPrice)\n{\n            _rrp = RRP;\n            _sellingPrice = SellingPrice;\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class is then constructed with values queried from a table using LINQ:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var products = from p in new ShopDataContext().Products                           \n                           select new Model.Product\n                           {\n                               Id = p.ProductId,\n                               Name = p.ProductName,\n                               Price = new Price(p.RRP, p.SellingPrice)\n                           };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the example this seems to work, however I am getting this error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Price = new Price(p.RRP, p.SellingPrice)\nThe best overload method match has some invalid arguments\nArgument 1: cannot convert from 'decimal?' to 'decimal' \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The p.RRP and p.SellingPrice values are taken from a table as System.Decimal types and apparently nullable by default hence the exception, tho in the example this seems to run ok, so Why is that?.

Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {   \n        JSONObject googleObject = StoresNearMe.getJSONfromURL(googleplacedetailapi);\n        JSONObject parsedGoogle = googleObject.getJSONObject(\"results\");\n        JSONArray  parsedevents = parsedGoogle.getJSONArray(\"events\");\n        //thing.setText(googleplacesapi);\n        if(parsedevents.equals(\"\") ){\n            Toast.makeText(FindDealer.this, \"No nearby locations\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        }else{\n            String phonenumber = parsedevents.getString(\"formatted_phone_number\");\n            thing.setText(phonenumber);   \n      }            \n  } catch (JSONException e) {\n      Log.d(\"log_tag\",\"JSON parsing error - Google Places Api:\" + e.getMessage());\n  }      \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","antlr","lexing"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":12306677,"title":"Can a lexer rule be applied in only one parser rule?","body":"<p>So the issue we're having with ANTLR is that we have a grammar that's parsing something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Hello, my name is bob.\nbob offset: 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the \"bob.\" in the first line is dynamic, and could be anything. One of those things is \"bob\". The \"bob offset\" line is not dynamic, and is in every file of the type that we are parsing.</p>\n\n<p>So, to parse this, we have a couple of rules:</p>\n\n<pre><code>greeting: 'Hello, my name is' id1=IDENT '.' NEWLINE\n    { System.out.println(\"Name: \" + $id1.text\"); }\n    ;\n\nbob_offset: 'bob offset:' id1=5 NEWLINE\n    { System.out.println(\"bob offset: \" + $id1.text); }\n    ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, the issue is that 'bob offset:' is a token that the lexer reads. Now, when the <code>greeting</code> rule goes, an error is thrown because it's trying to match 'bob' to 'bob offset:', but it can't.</p>\n\n<p>The solution that would be ideal is if ANTLR had some way to specify context- or parser rule-specific lexer rules. This way, the 'bob offset:' token wouldn't be mistaken anywhere else in the grammar.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts on this issue would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","parsing","function","content"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":0,"question_id":12305778,"title":"wordpress the_content parse outside the loop","body":"<p><code>the_content()</code> function parsed the text from the db in such a way that paragraphs for example will get <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag around them.

Are there other ways to qualify a grammar ?</p>\n\n<p>1) An ambiguous grammar is one that have several parse trees. But shouldn't the choice of a leftmost-derivation or rightmost-derivation lead to unicity of the parse tree ? </p>\n\n<p>[EDIT: Answered <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/243383/why-c-cannot-be-parsed-with-a-lr1-parser/1004737#1004737\">here</a> ]</p>\n\n<p>2.1) But still, is the ambiguity of the grammar related to k ? I mean giving a LR(2) grammar, is it ambiguous for a LR(1) parser and not ambiguous for a LR(2) one ?</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT: No it's not, a LR(2) grammar means that the parser will need two tokens of lookahead to choose the right rule to use. On the other hand, an ambiguous grammar is one that possibly leads to several parse trees. ] </p>\n\n<p>2.2) So a LR(*) parser, as long as you can imagine it, will have no ambiguous grammar at all and can then parse the entire set of context free languages ? </p>\n\n<p>[EDIT: Answered by Ira Baxter, LR(*) is less powerful than GLR, in that it can't handle multiple parse trees. ]</p>\n\n<p>3) Depending on the previous answers, what follows may be self contradictory. Considering LR parsing, do ambiguous grammars trigger shift-reduce conflict ? Can an unambiguous grammar trigger one too ? In the same way, what about reduce-reduce conflicts ?</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT: this is it, ambiguous grammars leads to shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts. By contrapositive, if there are no conflicts, the grammar is univocal. ]</p>\n\n<p>4) The ability to parse left-recursive grammar is an advantage of LR(k) parser over LL(k), is it the only difference between them ?</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT: yes. ]</p>\n\n<p>5) Giving G1 :</p>\n\n<pre><code>G1 :\nS -&gt; S + S\nS -&gt; S - S\nS -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5.1) G1 is both left-recursive, right-recursive, and ambiguous, am I right ? Is it a LR(2) grammar ? One would make it unambiguous :</p>\n\n<pre><code>G2 :\nS -&gt; S + a\nS -&gt; S - a\nS -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5.2) Is G2 still ambiguous ? Does a parser for G2 needs two lookaheads ? By factorisation we have :</p>\n\n<pre><code>G3 :\nS -&gt; S V\nV -&gt; + a\nV -&gt; - a\nS -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5.3) Now, does a parser for G3 need one lookahead only ?  What are the counter parts for doing these transformations ? Is LR(1) the minimal parser required ?</p>\n\n<p>5.4) G1 is left recursive, in order to parse it with a LL parser, one need to transform it into a right recursive grammar :</p>\n\n<pre><code>G4 :\nS -&gt; a + S\nS -&gt; a - S\nS -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then</p>\n\n<pre><code>G5 :\nS -&gt; a V\nV -&gt; - V\nV -&gt; + V\nV -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5.5) Does G4 need at least a LL(2) parser ? G5 only is parsable by a LL(1) parser, G1-G5 do define the same language, and this language is ( a (+/- a)^n ). Is it true ?</p>\n\n<p>5.6) For each grammar G1 to G5, what is the minimal set to which it belongs ?</p>\n\n<p>6) Finally, since many differents grammars may define the same language, how does one chose the grammar and the associated parser ? Is the resulting parse tree imortant ? What is the influence of the parse tree ?</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking a lot, and I don't really expect a complete answer, anyway any help would be very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thx for reading !</p>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","smalltalk","pharo","visualworks","petitparser"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":177,"score":5,"question_id":5703309,"title":"Where could I find more examples of using PetitParser?","body":"<p>I'm looking for additional examples of using PetitParser beyond PPArithmeticParser and PPLambdaParser that are provided in the tests package and a couple of blog posts by Lukas?

The parser is working now and I am implementing disambiguation rules. I am handling precedence in a way that seems to work. Now I'm a bit at loss regarding associativity.</p>\n\n<p>Say I have a grammar like this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>E &lt;- E '+' E (rule 1)\nE &lt;- E '-' E (rule 2)\nE &lt;- '0'     (rule 3)\nE &lt;- '1'     (rule 4)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where rules 1) and 2) have the same precedence and left associativity.</p>\n\n<p>Without associativity handling, the string '1-1+0' will generate two parse trees:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   1                2\n  / \\              / \\\n /   \\            /   \\\n2     3          4     1\n|  \\                   | \\\n4   4                  4  3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where numbers indicate the rule used for reduction. The correct parse tree is the first one and thus I would like to keep only this one.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering how to efficiently detect associativity infringements algorithmically.</p>\n\n<p>One approach I tried was to see that in the first tree, at the top node, rule 2 is LEFT of rule 3 in the list of children of rule 1, whereas in the second tree rule 1 is RIGHT of rule 4 and thus since rules 2 and 1 are LEFT associative I keep only the first tree.</p>\n\n<p>This, however, did not get me very far in more complicated examples. A limitation of this solution is that I can only discard trees based on a comparison with another tree.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think I can find a solution using a refined version of this approach?

I first tried using C++ streams, but it took almost 3 seconds to parse a 800Kb file. So i tried to do the same with C I/O functions and now it takes about 120 milliseconds.\nThe problem is that loading the same file with the DX API takes the same or almost same time, but it also loads everything and not only the geometry. So i think that there's something inefficient with my parser, that is only loading the geometry. With a profiler i noticed most of the time is spent on fscanf(), that i use to parse the vertices and indices. i also tried getting every line on a buffer and then using sscanf, but the time was the same. I'm not using STL.\nAny suggestions for how to do a faster parsing avoiding the use of fscanf? Please don't say \"use another library like Assimp\" because i'd like to do that myself.\nThanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","performance","parsing","enums","switch-statement"],"answer_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":726,"score":6,"question_id":7497148,"title":"Enum.Parse() or Switch","body":"<p>For converting a string to an enum, which of the following ways is better?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>colorEnum color = (colorEnum)Enum.Parse(typeof(colorEnum), \"Green\");\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>or this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string colorString = ...\ncolorEnum color;        \nswitch (colorString)\n{\n    case \"Green\":\n        color = colorEnum.Green;\n        break;\n    case \"Red\":\n        color = colorEnum.Red;\n        break;\n    case \"Orange\":\n        color = colorEnum.Orange;\n        break;\n    ....\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","parsing"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":145,"score":2,"question_id":12220018,"title":"Parse an online xml in java","body":"<p>I am trying to parse the xml from </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://free.worldweatheronline.com/feed/weather.ashx?key=14d7241962022903123108&amp;q=Pittsburgh,pa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://free.worldweatheronline.com/feed/weather.ashx?key=14d7241962022903123108&amp;q=Pittsburgh,pa</a></p>\n\n<p>All I need is a string of the weather description from the tag \"weatherDesc\"</p>\n\n<p>I have tried</p>\n\n<pre><code>    URL url = new URL(\"http://free.worldweatheronline.com/feed/weather.ashx?key=14d7241962022903123108&amp;q=Pittsburgh,pa.xml\");\n    URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();\n\n    DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n    DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n    Document doc = builder.parse(conn.getInputStream());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>what do i need to add to pick out the weatherDesc?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linq","parsing","linq-to-sql"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":2,"question_id":12219999,"title":"How do I filter in linq query when field needs parsing first?","body":"<p>I have a data table containing multiple columns and one column that stores somewhat complex text patterns - I need to parse the field to determine if a particular sub strings exist in specific positions within the larger string pattern and then if the record should be filtered out as a result.</p>\n\n<p>I can't see a way to perform the parse other than by writing a C# parsing function with String.Split method calls, foreach, etc. But if I try to parse like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myFilteredTable = _db.MyTable.Where(t =&gt; t.Column1 == 'Filter1' \n                                        &amp;&amp; ParseIsMyItemInColumn2(t) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get \"has no supported translation to SQL\" errors.</p>\n\n<p>The other option I thought of was to build the initial result without the Parse:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myFilteredTable = _db.MyTable.Where(t =&gt; t.Column1 == 'Filter1' );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and iterate through the IQueryable resultset, testing each row with the parse function, to filter out the unwanted rows, but IQueryable does not have Remove function to strip out unwanted rows nor Add function to allow me to build  up a new resultset.</p>\n\n<p>So how can I filter in linq when I also need to write a Parse function?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","string","parsing","lexer"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":131,"score":0,"question_id":12184765,"title":"C#: Converting String to Sequence of Known Operations","body":"<p>I want to convert a string of playing cards given as in A into a form B such that I can produce a result C.</p>\n\n<pre><code>A: \"(AK,AQ,(A2:*h*h)):*s*s!AsQs,(JJ:*s*h)\"\nB: (((AsKs union AsQs union (A2 intersect hand with two hearts)) intersect hand with two spades) less AsQs) union (JJ intersect hand with one spade one heart)\nC: AsKs,JsJh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The precedence of operations is</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) parentheses, '()'</li>\n<li>2) intersect and less (left associative), ':!'</li>\n<li>3) union, ','</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have the functionality to perform the operations in B, for example Intersect(\"AA\", \"*s*s\") == \"AsAs\", but I need a way to get from the form A into the form B of inputs and associated operations that I can perform in sequence to arrive at C.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked at <a href=\"http://irony.codeplex.com/releases/view/8499\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Irony\">Irony</a> and some other lexer/parser solutions, but they seem a bit overkill for this problem.

My parser method for a function declaration can relate to exactly one EmitLn(<em>C++ code here</em>) call. But what about parser methods that aren't that easy, such as expressions. Expressions are broken down to possibly many more calls, so that alludes to the need of a Emit() function that allows me to break down the output code for an expression piece by piece. <strong>Is there any boiler plate code for outputting code,</strong> such as the EmitLn function in Jack Crenshaw's Lets Build a Compiler?

My thinking behind seperating the two parts is that downloading the feeds may be quite intensive and slow if there are many of them and they are large. Similarly parsing the feeds into the database will most likley generate a lot of sql queries, updating current odds and inserting new matches etc. I plan on using stored procedures for the queries.</p>\n\n<p>My second question would be what is the best way to normalise things like the different team names as mentioned above. Would a synonym table in a database be the best way? The down side of this is that it would have to be manually checked as far as i can see to ensure the synonyms are corrent. It could also get quite large with multiple sports, teams, events etc.</p>\n\n<p>Another method could be using something like soundex or fuzzy matching to try and find the matches, i only have limited experience with this but im thinking that it would work well on things like Man Utd vs Man City.

UI looks something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VX59o.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The protocols being used are customized ones that we are using for our electrical equipments so there is a very specific parsing rule I need to use to make the application display the interpreted information. For the example, it is parsing 02 03 20 0f 30 30 31 24 64 31 30 31 03 5e and displaying interpreted information on the treeview based on the parsing rule given by the user.</p>\n\n<p>The parsing rule is given in an XML format. Below is an example of a parsing rule applied to interpret the above packet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;function_type size_total=\"14\" key=\"24 64 31\" key_index=\"7\" key_index_length=\"3\" name =\"Monitor Load\" id=\"select_d1\" transmission=\"tx\"&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"1\"&gt;STX&lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"3\"&gt;Type\n      &lt;convert index=\"0\"&gt;20,Control&lt;/convert&gt;\n      &lt;convert index=\"0\"&gt;40,Monitor&lt;/convert&gt;\n    &lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"3\" decimal=\"true\"&gt;Serial&lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"3\"&gt;Function Code\n      &lt;convert index=\"0\"&gt;24,Control&lt;/convert&gt;\n      &lt;convert index=\"0\"&gt;23,Respond&lt;/convert&gt;\n    &lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"2\" address=\"true\"&gt;LIU&lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"1\"&gt;ETX&lt;/data_type&gt;\n    &lt;data_type size=\"1\"&gt;LRC&lt;/data_type&gt;\n  &lt;/function_type&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It basically reads the byte from left to right sequentially and displays the corresponding byte. Key attribute in the function type refers to the sequence of bytes that best distinguishes the packets that need to be parsed. (I.E: if there is any byte that starts from key_index, has a length of key_index_length, and is equal to key, then parse that packet) Convert tag with index refers to what information to display on the treeview based on the byte received (For example, under FunctionCode datatype, it is going to be displaying 3 bytes. It will check the first byte (index=0) and if it is equal to the value that is to the left side of the comma in the convert tag, then the string to the right side of the comma is displayed. In this example, from 3 bytes of FunctionCode (24 64 31), since the first byte is equal to Control, treeview will display that as a result.</p>\n\n<p>There's another protocol called MODBUS that I need to parse and the parsing rule is the following:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xjdx9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PZ6MG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Query is very straight forward.

Currently, regexes are fine for this, however, I'm starting to get to the point where a real parser is going to be needed in order to deal with nested structures so I'm investigating ocamllex/ocamlyacc.  I'd like to first duplicate what I've got in my regex implementation and then slowly add more to the grammar.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I'm mainly interested in pulling out module declarations and instantiations.  To keep this question a bit more brief, let's look at module declarations only.</p>\n\n<p>In Verilog a module declaration looks like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>module modmame ( ...other statements ) endmodule;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My current regex implementation simply checks that there is a module declared with a particular name ( checking against a list of names that I'm interested in - I don't need to find all module declarations just ones with certain names).  So basically, I get each line of the Verilog file I want to parse and do a match like this (pseudo-OCaml with Pythonish and Rubyish elements ):</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach file in list_of_files:\n  let found_mods = Hashtbl.create 17;\n  open file \n  foreach line in file:\n    foreach modname in modlist\n    let mod_patt=  Str.regexp (\"module\"^space^\"+\"^modname^\"\\\\(\"^space^\"+\\\\|(\\\\)\") in \n    try\n      Str.search_forward (mod_patt) line 0\n      found_mods[file] = modname; (* map filename to modname *)\n    with Not_found -&gt; ()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That works great.  The module declaration can occur anywhere in the Verilog file; I'm just wanting to find out if the file contains that particular declaration, I don't care about what else may be in that file.  </p>\n\n<p>My first attempt at converting this over to ocamllex/ocamlyacc:</p>\n\n<p>verLexer.mll:</p>\n\n<pre><code>rule lex = parse\n  | [' ' '\\n' '\\t']               { lex lexbuf }\n  | ['0'-'9']+ as s               { INT(int_of_string s) }\n  | '('                           { LPAREN }\n  | ')'                           { RPAREN }\n  | \"module\"                      { MODULE }\n  | ['A'-'Z''a'-'z''0'-'9''_']+ as s  { IDENT(s) }\n  | _                             { lex lexbuf }\n  | eof \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>verParser.mly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>%{ type expr =  Module of expr | Ident of string | Int of int %}\n\n%token &lt;int&gt; INT\n%token &lt;string&gt; IDENT\n%token  LPAREN RPAREN MODULE EOF\n\n%start expr1\n%type &lt;expr&gt; expr1\n\n%%\n\nexpr:   \n| MODULE IDENT LPAREN    { Module( Ident $2) };\n\nexpr1:   \n| expr EOF { $1 };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then trying it out in the REPL:</p>\n\n<pre><code># #use \"verLexer.ml\" ;; \n# #use \"verParser.ml\" ;; \n# expr1 lex (Lexing.from_string \"module foo (\" ) ;;\n- : expr = Module (Ident \"foo\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's great, it works!</p>\n\n<p>However, a real Verilog file will have more than a module declaration in it:</p>\n\n<pre><code># expr1 lex (Lexing.from_string \"//comment\\nmodule foo ( \\nstuff\" ) ;;\nException: Failure \"lexing: empty token\".\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't really care about what appeared before or after that module definition, is there a way to just extract that part of the grammar to determine that the Verilog files contains the 'module foo (' statement?  Yes, I realize that regexes are working fine for this, however, as stated above, I am planning to grow this grammar slowly and add more elements to it and regexes will start to break down.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I added a match any char to the lex rule: </p>\n\n<pre><code>      | _                             { lex lexbuf }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thinking that it would skip any characters that weren't matched so far, but that didn't seem to work:</p>\n\n<pre><code> # expr1 lex (Lexing.from_string \"fof\\n module foo (\\n\" ) ;;\n Exception: Parsing.Parse_error.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","html-parsing","html-agility-pack"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":12072028,"title":"parse html table - htmlagilitypack","body":"<p>I have an html table with this syntax :\ntable class=\\\"res\\\">\\n\\ thead>\\n\\ tr>\\n\\ th>\\n\\Тур/th>\\n\\ th class=\\\"c\\\">text ...........</p>\n\n<p>and my problem to parse this, is the class structrure : class=\\\"res\\\".</p>\n\n<p>my code is the following :</p>\n\n<pre><code>HtmlWeb hw = new HtmlWeb();\nHtmlDocument doc = hw.Load(\"http://localhost:38800/table.aspx\");\nHtmlNodeCollection tables = doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\"//table[@class='res']\"); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>what am i do wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","parsing","dom","mechanize","relative-path"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":196,"score":0,"question_id":6065736,"title":"Dom-Processing with Perl-Mechanize: finalizing a little programme","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a little harvester, using <a href=\"http://www.edi.admin.ch/esv/00475/00698/index.html?lang=de&amp;webgrab_path=http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/d/entry.asp?Id=1308\" rel=\"nofollow\">this dataset of 2700 foundations</a>.

Basically the URL query looks for links that have the webgrap_path to Id pattern, which is unique for each database entry.

For the <strong>semantic extraction</strong> of the entry information,we could parse the content of the actual entries with XML:LibXML's html parser (which works fine on this page), because it gives you some powerful DOM selection (using XPath) methods.\nWell the actual looping through the pages should be doable in a few lines of Perl (max. 20 lines &#8212; likely less).</p>\n\n<p><strong>But wait</strong>: the processing of the entry pages will then be the most complex part \nof the script. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Approaches</strong>: In principle we could do the same algorithm with a single while loop\nif we use the back() function smartly. </p>\n\n<p>Can you give me a hint for the beginning &#8212; the processing of the entry pages &#8212; doing this in Perl:: Mechanize?</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I have: </p>\n\n<pre><code> GetThePage(\n    starting url \n);\nsub GetThePage {\n    my $mech ...\n    my @pages = ...\n    while(@pages) {\n       my $page = shift @pages;\n       $mech-&gt;get( $page );\n       push @pages, GetMorePages( $mech );\n       SomethingImportant( $mech );\n       SomethingXPATH( $mech );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The question is how to find the DOM-paths.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","parsing","csv"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":100,"score":0,"question_id":12078689,"title":"C reading csv file","body":"<p>I'm running into a problem I haven't encountered before and am baffled... for some reason when I try to read a CSV file char by char but it seems like spaces are somehow getting placed there... and what's weirder is the fact that no space chars exist anywhere.

It's probably not a performance issue, but I'm curious to know if there's a more efficient method to do this, or possibly even an existing method within the framework?
