I have researched for about 2 days now before posting this question but could not find anything helpful :( I am genuinely stuck and would appreciate ANY help. This is most likely a very <strong>simple</strong>/basic question:</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I am trying to get this data (<a href=\"http://countdown.api.tfl.gov.uk/interfaces/ura/instant_V1?StopCode1=59581&amp;DirectionID=1&amp;VisitNumber=1&amp;ReturnList=StopCode1,StopPointName,LineName,DestinationText,EstimatedTime,MessageUUID,MessageText,MessagePriority,MessageType,ExpireTime\" rel=\"nofollow\">LINK</a>) which is apparrently in UTF-8 JSON and display it on a simple label on Xcode. However, I do not know how to get that data and parse it at all. I've followed a <a href=\"http://www.raywenderlich.com/5492/working-with-json-in-ios-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">tutorial online</a> with success, but that deals with JSON objects rather than arrays (which I think I am dealing with).</p>\n\n<p>I would HIGHLY appreciate it if someone could extract/parse the data from the first link given into a basic label on Xcode in code format.Preferably with commentary on what most lines of code are doing for my own benefit, as this would really help me understand how it works. Hopefully from there, I would be able to make good progress.</p>\n\n<p>Once again this is highly appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Thank YOu.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a sample of the JSON URL for convenience if you don't want to click the link:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[4,\"1.0\",1343920773538]\n[1,\"Spring Gardens\",\"59581\",\"275\",\"Barkingside\",1343920940000,1343920940000]\n[1,\"Spring Gardens\",\"59581\",\"275\",\"Barkingside\",1343921717000,1343921717000]\n[1,\"Spring Gardens\",\"59581\",\"549\",\"Loughton\",1343921858000,1343921858000]\n[1,\"Spring Gardens\",\"59581\",\"275\",\"Barkingside\",1343922204000,1343922204000]\n[2,\"Spring Gardens\",\"59581\",\"8a56a0ab37b72b400137cb7cfd954038_29222\",0,3,\"Bus routes serving this stop are subject to change during the Olympics and Paralympics games.

I have a DOM element that serves as a container, and two buttons.

I'm assuming that the parsing is somehow done to the new content and not to the whole content(?), so is there a way to re-parse the element without resulting to the use of an iframe and reload, or am I out of luck here. Maybe I'm focusing this issue the wrong way, please feel free to point me in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/anHPy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">second fiddle</a> to illustrate, although I believe this example while similar, fails because leaving an open <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag will wrap all other elements in closed <code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code> tags, ergo when closing the one I originally left open, the others still have their own (I'm guessing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've developed a code <em>recorder</em> you could say, where you type your code, this code is stored as a JSON object and can be <em>played</em> back to the user, one character at a time (now it makes more sense), but of course I want the code to be parsed while it's being played if it's valid.</p>\n\n<p>I had this working as and Iframe since I can simply reload the contents and it will be parsed again, but I wanted to try a different approach (had some free time) and was struggling getting the HTML parsed if it wasn't added at once. </p>\n\n<p>I'm doing it with an interval and taking into consideration the time between ketstrokes, but thought it would be cleared to do it in a loop for this question, since the important part was the end result.

I'm having a little bit of trouble figuring out the best way to define function signatures, and determining whose responsibility it is to validate the input to those functions.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I have a simple grammar that defines the basic elements of my language.  This includes  a handful of binary operators, parentheses, numbers, identifiers, and function calls. The BNF for my grammar looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; | &lt;parenexp&gt; | &lt;binexp&gt; | &lt;fncall&gt; | &lt;identifier&gt;\n&lt;parenexp&gt;   ::= ( &lt;expression&gt; )\n&lt;fncall&gt;     ::= &lt;identifier&gt; ( &lt;argumentlist&gt; )\n&lt;binexp&gt;     ::= &lt;expression&gt; &lt;binop&gt; &lt;expression&gt;\n&lt;binop&gt;      ::= + - * / %\n... the rest of the grammar definition\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the Irony parser, I am able to validate the syntax of various input strings to make sure they conform to this grammar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x + y / z * AVG(a + b, p)   -&gt; Valid Syntax\nx +/ AVG(x                  -&gt; Invalid Syntax\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All that is well and good, but now I want to go a step further and define the available functions, along with the number of parameters that each function requires.  So for example, I want to have a function <code>FOO</code> that accepts one parameter and <code>BAR</code> that accepts two parameters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FOO(a + b) * BAR(x + y, p + q)    -&gt; Valid\nFOO(a + b, 13)                    -&gt;  Invalid\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the second statement is parsed, I'd like to be able to output an error message that is aware of the expected input for this function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Too many arguments specified for function 'FOO'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't actually need to evaluate any of these statements, only validate the syntax of the statements and determine if they are valid expressions or not.  </p>\n\n<p>How exactly should I be doing this?  I know that technically I could simply add the functions to the grammar like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;foofncall&gt; ::= FOO( &lt;expression&gt; )\n&lt;barfncall&gt; ::= BAR( &lt;expression&gt;, &lt;expression&gt; )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But something about this doesn't feel quite right.

However, as you can see, My requirements are that it go in one layer further.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody else use this library and have you run into similar issues?\nIf not, what do you use for CodeIgniter template parsing?

I'm interested in the problem immediately before: how to specify the grammar in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using the term grammar somewhat loosely to include not only the grammar, but also the corresponding specification for the lexical analyzer.  In other word, the \"grammar\" I'm thinking of is one whose \"atoms\" are not tokens, but rather characters (or unicode characters if you prefer).  (I gather that this would correspond to the two-part problem of writing an input file for lex or flex, specifying the \"grammar\" for the lexical analyzer/tokenizer, and an input file for yacc or bison, specifying the grammar proper.  The distinction between the lexical analysis and parsing stages seems to me a bit artificial, and I gather that some parsing packages abolish it altogether, but I admit that my grasp on all this is very tenuous, so these parenthetical remarks may very well be all hogwash.)</p>\n\n<p>One more clarification: As the example I began this post with already makes clear, I am not concerned at the moment with the problem of designing a syntax (as language designer would have to do, for example) although I'm sure it is an interesting problem of its own right.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>[I originally asked this a version of this question in programmers.SE, but learned that questions that ask for a reference to the literature are frowned upon in that stack, because they don't lend themselves to extended, discursive replies, so I'm trying my luck here.]</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","xml","regex","parsing","vba"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":10,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2476,"score":12,"question_id":8798260,"title":"html parsing of cricinfo scorecards","body":"<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am looking to scrape 20/20 cricket scorecard data from the <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com\">Cricinfo wesbite</a>, ideally into <strong>CSV form</strong> for data analysis in Excel</p>\n\n<p>As an example the current <em>Australian Big Bash 2011/12 scorecards</em> are available from</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Game 1: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524915.html\">http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524915.html</a>  </li>\n<li>Last Game: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524935.html\">http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2011/engine/match/524935.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I am proficient in using VBA (either automating <code>IE</code> or using <code>XMLHTTP</code> and then using regular expressions) to scrape data from websites, ie \n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/8776484/641067\">Extract values from HTML TD and Tr</a></p>\n\n<p>In that same question a comment was posted suggesting html parsing - which I hadn't come accross before - so I have taken a look at questions such as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags\">RegEx match open tags except XHTML self-contained tags</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Query</strong></p>\n\n<p>While I could write a regex to parse the cricket data below I would like advice as to how I could efficiently retrieve these results with html parsing.</p>\n\n<p>Please bear in mind that my preference is a repeatable CSV format containing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the date/name of the match</li>\n<li>Team 1 name </li>\n<li>the output should dump up to 11 records for Team 1 (blank records where players haven't batted, ie <em>\"Did Not Bat\"</em>)</li>\n<li>Team 2 name </li>\n<li>the output should dump up to 11 records for Team 2 (blank records where players haven't batted)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nirvana for me would be a solution that I could deploy using VBA or VBscript so I could fully automate my analyis but I presume I will have to use a separate tool for the html parse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sample Site links and Data to be Extracted</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mCyrW.png\" alt=\"cricinfo scorecard\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vxIXT.png\" alt=\"source date\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":60,"score":-3,"question_id":13214112,"title":"Why html source is different when I opened it from web browser and read it in Java?","body":"<p>I have a question about parsering online html page.</p>\n\n<p>when I open html source from a web browser, I can see the data in there. </p>\n\n<p>But when I read this html page from java.

Now this is solvable as I have shown for air temperature in code example. <strong>But get this</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>When the air temperature is for example 55°F, it prints only 55. There is no decimal zero after fixed value. The same goes for wind speed. The values that can have decimal point value are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wind speed 10min average</li>\n<li>Wind speed (mph)</li>\n<li>Inside Temperature (°F)</li>\n<li>Outside Temperature (°F)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there are 4^2 = 16 combinations of different file structure.

My original thought was to use sed or similar utility with regex, but reading some of the replies here for other HTML parsing questions it seems that there might be a better solution.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I was facing with the regex was a lack of support for detecting if the string I wanted to match: <code>(src|href|action)=[\"']/</code> was in <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> tags or not, so that I could then either perform string concatenation if the match was in PHP tags, or add in new PHP tags should it not be. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(1) &lt;img id=\"icon-loader-small\" src=\"/css/images/loader-small.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle; display:none;\"/&gt;\n(2) &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"name\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;loggedInAs()?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;a href=\"/Login/logout\"&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n(3) &lt;?php echo ($watched_dir-&gt;getExistsFlag())?\"\":\"&lt;span class='ui-icon-alert'&gt;&lt;img src='/css/images/warning-icon.png'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\"?&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo $watched_dir-&gt;getDirectory();?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"ui-icon ui-icon-close\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n(EDIT: 4) &lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"/Preference/stream-setting\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" onsubmit=\"return confirm('&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;confirm_pypo_restart_text ?&gt;');\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In (1) there a <code>src=\"/css</code>, and as it is not in PHP tags I want that to become <code>src=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/css</code>. In (2), there is a PHP tag but it is not around the <code>href=\"/Login</code>, so it also becomes <code>href=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/Login</code>.\nUnfortunately, (3) has <code>src='/css</code> but <em>inside</em> the PHP tags (it is an echoed string). It is also quoted by <code>\"</code> in the PHP code, so the modification needs to pick up on that too. The final result would look something like: <code>src='\".$baseUrl.\"/css</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All the other modifications to my HTML and PHP files have been done using a regex (I know, I know...). If regexes could support matching everything except a certain pattern, like <code>[^(&lt;\\?php)(\\?&gt;)]*</code> then I would be flying through this part. Unfortunately it seems that this is Type 2 grammar territory. So - what should I use?\nIdeally it needs to be installed by default with the GNU suite, but other tools like PHP itself or other interpreters are fine too, just not preferred. Of course, if someone could structure a regex that would work on the above examples, then that would be excellent.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: (4) is the nasty match, where most regexes will fail.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","parsing","beautifulsoup"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13202087,"title":"Beautiful Soup find children for particular div","body":"<p>I have am trying to parse a webpage that looks like this with Python->Beautiful Soup:<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EYqXD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to extract the contents of the highlighted td div.

Searching the Internet hasn't really yielded much results, everyone has a different way and different process usually geared towards their own Web Service making it a one time use type of solution. Basically, below is the response that I get from a Web Service</p>\n\n<pre><code>anyType{\n schema=anyType{\n  element=anyType{\n   complexType=anyType{\n    choice=anyType{\n     element=anyType{\n      complexType=anyType{\n       sequence=anyType{\n        element=anyType{}; \n           element=anyType{}; \n            element=anyType{}; \n              element=anyType{}; }; }; }; }; }; }; };   \n      diffgram=anyType{\n         NewDataSet=anyType{\n          Rep_x0020_Information=anyType{\n            Login=CorrectLogin; Password=InCorrectPass; }; }; }; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And basically I want to be able to parse out just the two important fields (Login and Password). From what I read I tried just iterating through the SoapObject response based on the property count but that doesn't seem to work.

I need them to be able to go to a 'send email' page, where they can select a lead, or multiple leads, by name.  Then there is a subject field, and a message field so they can write the email, and then I have a 'send email' form submit button.  After they click 'send email' I want to get back the email addresses and names of the leads they selected, for later use.  I need to have the email addresses separated by commas, so that I can send them through a php mail function...  But the important thing is, I want the info from the form to be stored in a database table called 'PendingEmails', and I am going to run a cron job to run a script that finds what emails need to be sent, and sends them...  After an email is sent, I need to put the names, subject, and message from the email in a separate database, called 'SentEmails'.  On a different page on the site, I want the users to be able to see all the emails they sent, but I want them to see the names of who they sent it to, rather than the email addresses.  This is why I need both the names and the emails.  I need emails for the mail function, and names to be displayed back to the user.

Please help, thank you.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is the XML file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;allSkis&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;1&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Kastle&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;BMX 88&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;Built on a versatile 88mm platform the BMX 88 is both very quick edge to edge with the ability to rip arcs down groomers and hardpacked and wide enough to float over crud and light powder with grace and control. With a full vertical sidewall and tip to tail wood core the BMX 88 has the makings of a powerful and unruly ski but has Kastle has seemed to tame the 88 down where it prefers smooth and driving arcs with a seemingly effortless transition edge to edge. When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88. For the skier that wants off piste versatility but splits time evenly between hard and soft snow the BMX 88 is a ski that can handle the workload with a level of grace and ease you would expect from a top end small ski builder.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;2&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Line&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Blend&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;A NEW BLEND OF ALL YOUR FAVORITE FREESTYLE SKIS. The Blend is completely re-designed to be over 10% lighter thanks to our new innovative core, thinner tips, and capwall construction. The reduced swing weight feels like you don't have skis on your feet for floating pillow lines like a pro, ninja-like agility in the trees, and maching switch runs on the way to the park like you never left it. Anywhere, any day, any condition, any terrain, it's the Blend.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;3&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Rossignol&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;S3&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;The S3 is an all-mountain powder ski with an award-winning blend of versatility and float. Featuring narrower dimensions and more traditional tail-shape than the S7, the S3 delivers increased agility and all-mountain versatility. Powder Turn Rocker delivers fatigue-free manueverability, effortless steering and instant speed control, making powder skiing easier and more fun. Centered Sidecut provides the all-terrain versatility and edging power simply not found in other wide-waisted, rockered skis. Explore in-bounds and sidecountry stashes on the S3, the award-winning all-mountain powder ski. &lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Here is the .m file, but I dont have anything in it, as I can find the correct way to do it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"ViewController.h\"\n#import \"TouchXML.h\"\n\n@interface ViewController ()\n\n@end\n\n@implementation ViewController\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n//  and we print our results\n[super viewDidLoad];\n// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\n}\n\n-(IBAction)skiRightPressed:(id)sender {\n//here is my main action (when a button is pressed)\n}\n\n- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning\n{\n[super didReceiveMemoryWarning];\n// Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n"},{"tags":["json","jsp","browser","object","parsing"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":4805,"score":0,"question_id":829643,"title":"processing json objects in jsp","body":"<p>i have a JSON object sent from the browser to the jsp page. how do i receive that object and process it in jsp. do i need any specific parsers? i have used the following piece of code. but it wouldnt work. essentially i should read the contents of the object and print them in the jsp. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%@page language=\"java\" import=\"jso.JSONObject\"%&gt;\n\n&lt;%\nJSONObject inp=request.getParameter(\"param1\");\n%&gt;\n\n&lt;% for(int i=0;i&lt;inp.size();i++)\n{%&gt;\n    &lt;%=inp.getString(i)%&gt;\n&lt;%\n}\n%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","parsing","scalability","parse.com"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":390,"score":2,"question_id":11283729,"title":"How scalable is Parse?","body":"<p>I've been considering using Parse.com's service for my backend, but I'm skeptical about its scalability.</p>\n\n<p>Can it <em>really</em> handle several thousand simultaneous users?

I'm looking to list ONLY the first h1 tags in each partial.  The methods to accomplish this task could probably be modified to grab other elements as well.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I use ruby to open each file, print out the first few characters, close file, and repeat.  My ruby file parsing skills are limiting me.

Again I'm only reading first 20 characters because I haven't yet grasped a way to search for the first h1 tag.</p>\n\n<p>I'll make edits as I work through the open, parse, piece... I appreciate any guidance and direction you can offer. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nBased on comments below there may be a far better way to accomplish my task.  So I'm providing some additional background to get direction on other solutions.</p>\n\n<p>This is for a slide show based on partials in a directory.  The slide show is controlled with a navigation element  which I would like to populate by the h1 tags in the partials.  I'm not going to manually enter these things every time a change is made!  I want the end user to simply drag and drop partials into a directory (with a certain name convention and h1 tag description for navigation) and let the slide show do everything else.</p>\n\n<p>I could impose a class on the h1 tag \"forNavigation\" and on the content \"sliderContent\" and then use jquery to create a post load <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> but that doesn't seem right.  Plus they'll all be part of the same rendered div.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I'm not clear why reading the first 50 characters of a partial, copying whats in the h1 tags, and putting it in a  isn't the most elegant solution?</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, above does everything needed except copy and print whats between the first h1 tag... With an xml parser or some regexp it'll be done.  I'm just no good with parsing files.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know other methods to approach this.  Right now I still think it's best to parse the partial (with or without rendering) and put what I need where I want it as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":13144524,"title":"sending post with Java","body":"<p>I have a bash script when I logged in a web page to then parse the html.

I understand the fundamentals of how to do this but am having trouble implementing the ParseTree class.

The actual work happens in the function <i>parseSkedTable()</i>, please concentrate on this one. Also, I would like to point out the term \"double courses\" appearing in the comments, which describes two different courses happening at the same time (the class would be split in such moments).

Since JavaScript (being especially powerful here because of the ability to use browser-rendered data) seems to be the only efficient way to retrieve reliable information from the HTML, I am now looking for a way to implement some kind of headless browser or rendering engine on my free server at x10hosting.com. Sadly, I am neither able to install software other than provided by <a href=\"http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">softaculous</a> nor allowed to use PHP's <em>exec()</em> command.<br>\nAny idea would be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of completeness, I'll post both solutions, existing until now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/3t2A8/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery parser</a> <em>by Pierre Dubois</em>: </p>\n\n<p>(function ($) {\n    $(document).ready(function() {</p>\n\n<pre><code>    var _pe = window.pe || {\n        fn : {}\n    };\n\n    var tblNumber = 0; // Just a incremental number to identify the schedule item with the table\n\n    // For each table\n    $('table').each(function () {\n\n        $('#output').append('Parsing the table number: ' + tblNumber + '&lt;br&gt;');\n        // console.log('Parsing the table number: ' + tblNumber);\n        tblNumber += 1;\n\n        var currentTable = this;\n\n\n        // Parser the complex table\n        _pe.fn.parsertable.parse($(currentTable));\n\n        // Retrieve the parsed data\n        var parsedData = $(currentTable).data().tblparser;\n\n        //\n        // Information about the column structure, nice that is consistent\n        //\n\n        // Day: Cell index position (0 based)\n        // Mo: 3\n        // Di: 7\n        // Mi: 11\n        // Do: 15\n        // Fr: 19\n        // Sa: 23\n\n        // Title Location at Row index position \"0\"\n\n        // \"i\" represent the middle column position\n        for (var i = 3; i &lt; 24; i += 4) {\n\n            var currentDay;\n\n            // Get the day\n            currentDay = $(parsedData.row[0].cell[i].elem).text();\n\n            $('#output').append('  Day: ' + currentDay + '&lt;br&gt;');\n            // console.log('Day: ' + currentDay);\n\n            // Get all the events for that day, excluding the first row and the last row\n            for (var j = 1; j &lt; parsedData.col[i].cell.length - 2; j += 1) {\n\n                // First column \n                if (parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].uid ) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Second Column\n                if (parsedData.col[i].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid &amp;&amp;\n                    parsedData.col[i - 1].cell[j].uid !== parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Third Column\n                if (parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j - 1].uid !== parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].uid &amp;&amp;\n                    parsedData.col[i].cell[j].uid !== parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].uid) {\n\n                    // Get the content of that cell and remove ending space\n                    var event = $(parsedData.col[i + 1].cell[j].elem).text().trim();\n\n                    if (event.length &gt; 0) {\n                        $('#output').append('  + Event: ' + event + '&lt;br&gt;');\n                        // console.log('Event: ' + event);\n                    }\n                }\n            } \n\n        }\n\n    });\n\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}(jQuery));</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/W9Zhw/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JS parser using positional\n    information</a> <em>by me, realizing rambo\n    coder's idea</em>  </p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","optimization","syntax-highlighting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":1,"question_id":13051069,"title":"Live syntax-highlighting parser for large files","body":"<p>I'm familiar with parser generators and the basics of parsers processing a stream all at once from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>My question is for situations like syntax-highlighting text editors.

Since the <code>case class Var</code> class declaration is missing its closing brace you would think the compiler would tell you that the opening brace for that declaration (on line 11) is missing its closing brace. However, <code>scalac</code> reports that it \"assumes\" a missing closing brace in the middle of a previous <code>case class</code> declaration (on line 7). (The full error output is included at the bottom of the posted code.)</p>\n\n<p>Most <code>scalac</code> error messages make sense if you understand the internals of the language, but I'm at a total loss here. How does a missing closing brace in a later class declaration end up propagating to an already successfully parsed class definition earlier in the file?</p>\n\n<p>How on earth do you go about explaining this to a Scala beginner? Leaving off a closing brace is exactly the kind of mistake someone new to Scala might commonly do, but the error message here seems like it would lead the user so far astray that it would probably be more helpful to just report something like <code>error: you seem to be missing a '}' somewhere</code> instead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: I know the usual answer to questions like this is just \"use an IDE and the incremental compilation will flag it right away\" or \"syntax highlighting should make this error obvious\"—but my question is asking specifically about the <code>scalac</code> output, so please keep in mind that I know those are valid points but I really just want to understand what is going on with the compiler here.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n\n<p>Let me try a different approach to explaining my confusion. The error stems from a missing closing brace, so it's obviously a problem with brace nesting. Transforming the text (code) in the snippet I posted to a series of line-number+brace pairs we get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1{ 4}\n6{ 9}\n11{ 12{ 15}\n    19{ 22}\n    24{ 26}\n    28{ 33}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We obviously have a missing closing brace. I could understand <code>scalac</code> guessing the missing brace could go in any one of these places (each represented by an <code>x</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>1{ 4}\n6{ 9}\n11{ x 12{ x 15} x &lt;-- HERE OR HERE OR HERE\n      19{ x 22} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n      24{ x 26} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n      28{ x 33} x &lt;-- OR HERE OR HERE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this is what the output from <code>scalac</code> says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   +----- I THINK YOU ARE MISSING A\n   |      CLOSING BRACE RIGHT HERE!\n1{ V 4}\n6{ x 9} \n11{ 12{ 15}\n    19{ 22}\n    24{ 26}\n    28{ 33}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That part of the input is already well-nested! How could adding another closing brace there possibly make any sense?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I feel like I should reiterate my main question again: <em>How would you go about explaining this error message (and how to find the root of the error in the source) to a newcomer to Scala?</em></p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","parsing","types","json.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":129,"score":3,"question_id":10520144,"title":"JSON.NET - Can I hint types in XML to be parsed?","body":"<p>When I parse XML using JsonConvert.SerializeXNode or JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNode the following code</p>\n\n<pre><code>XElement person = XElement.Parse(@\"\n  &lt;person&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Palle&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;true&lt;/member&gt;\n  &lt;/person&gt;\");\n\nstring json = JsonConvert.SerializeXNode(person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>give me this json result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"person\":{\"name\":\"Palle\",\"member\":\"true\"}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here member is typed as a string, I would like this to be typed as a bool.

As an exercise I'm trying to write my own JSON parser in the PARSE dialect.</p>\n\n<p>Since Douglas Crockford <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=780554\" rel=\"nofollow\">credits influence of Rebol on his discovery of JSON</a>, I thought it would be easy.  Outside of replacing braces with brackets and getting rid of all those commas, one of the barriers to merely using <code>LOAD</code> on the string is the fact that when they want to do the equivalent of a <code>SET-WORD!</code> they use something that looks like a string to Rebol's tokenizer, with an illegal stray colon after it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"key one\": {\n         \"summary\": \"This is the string content for key one's summary\",\n         \"value\": 7\n    },\n    \"key two\": {\n         \"summary\": \"Another actually string, not supposed to be a 'symbol'\",\n         \"value\": 100\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically I wanted to find all the cases that were like <code>\"foo bar\":</code> and turn them into <code>foo-bar:</code> while leaving matching quote pairs that were not followed by colons alone.</p>\n\n<p>When I tackled this in PARSE (which I understand rather well in principle but still haven't used much) a couple of questions came up.  But mainly, what are the promised conditions under which when you can escape into code and modify the series out from under the parser...specifically in Rebol 3?  More generally, is it the <em>\"right kind of tool for the job\"</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Here was the rule I tried, that appears to work for this part of the task:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>any [\n    ; require a matched pair of quotes &amp; capture series positions before\n    ; and after the first quote, and before the last quote\n\n    to {\"} beforePos: skip startPos: to {\"} endPos: skip\n\n    ; optional colon next (if not there the rest of the next rule is skipped)\n\n    opt [\n        {:}\n\n        ; if we got to this part of the optional match rule, there was a colon.\n        ; we escape to code changing spaces to dashes in the range we captured\n\n        (\n            setWordString: copy/part startPos endPos\n            replace/all setWordString space \"-\"\n            change startPos setWordString\n        )\n\n        ; break back out into the parse dialect, and instead of changing the \n        ; series length out from under the parser we jump it back to the position\n        ; before that first quote that we saw\n\n        :beforePos\n\n        ; Now do the removals through a match rule.

Is there any chance of the <code>change startPos setWordString</code> in the open code mucking up the outer parse...if not in this case, then in something subtly different?</p>\n\n<p>As always, any didactic <em>\"it's cleaner/shorter/better this other way\"</em> advice is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> why isn't there a <code>replace/all/part</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","xml","parsing","zip"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":12983365,"title":"Explain parsing xml and element trees","body":"<p>I was asked to interpret some of this code and am still very new to Python and programming.

My parser is in fact already complete, but at present is a mess of <code>switch</code>...<code>case</code> statements and the focus of my question is how I can refactor this using a nice OO approach.</p>\n\n<p>First, here's an example to illustrate what I'm doing overall.

It's awkward to use from Obj-C, and I expect it will be terribly awkward from a language that doesn't have compile-link-run as part of its standard operating procedure.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking for is something that will pass the \"inline-online-universal\" test.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>(inline) You can write the notation inline with your other code, as you would with a regex..</p></li>\n<li><p>(online) You can run the resulting parser just as you would your other code, which would mean right after input to a REPL in the case of something like Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>(universal) You can move to a different language/platform and use virtually the same code for your parser, modulo dialect differences. In reality, I'd be happy with something that works from Python, Ruby, C, Java, and Haskell.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Most tools I know of fall down at \"online\". They preprocess a grammar offline and spit out code in the target language (C, Python, Java, C++…). They're standalone tools that aren't themselves integrated into the language environment.</p>\n\n<p>I've had suggestions of PEG parsers and lex/yacc combos. Parser combinator libraries might also be a good fit. Whatever you might propose, I'd like to see demonstrated that it meets these tests. Your answer should demonstrate that the proposed solution meets the inline-online-universal requirements by providing a working demo parser in Python, C, and Haskell. The demo example is up to the author, but it should be something painful using just regexen but trivial using a proper parser.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","json","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":12965501,"title":"Parse JSON redirect to Init point Ruby","body":"<p>With this code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>result = JSON.parse(mp_data.to_json)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I got the follow JSON saved at result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"payment_methods\"=&gt;{}, \"init_point\"=&gt;\"https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/checkout/pay?pref_id=126967384-e4abf2e6-79c5-47c6-8c0d-fce045278336\", \"collector_id\"=&gt;126967384, \"back_urls\"=&gt;{\"failure\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/failure\", \"pending\"=&gt;\"https://www.site.com/pending\", \"success\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/success\"}, \"sponsor_id\"=&gt;nil, \"expiration_date_from\"=&gt;nil, \"additional_info\"=&gt;\"\", \"marketplace_fee\"=&gt;0, \"date_created\"=&gt;\"2012-10-18T19:46:13.791-04:00\", \"subscription_plan_id\"=&gt;nil, \"id\"=&gt;\"126967384-e4abf2e6-79c5-47c6-8c0d-fce045278336\", \"expiration_date_to\"=&gt;nil, \"expires\"=&gt;false, \"external_reference\"=&gt;\"OPERATION-ID-14288\", \"payer\"=&gt;{\"email\"=&gt;\"buyer@email.com\", \"name\"=&gt;\"John\", \"surname\"=&gt;\"Mikel\"}, \"items\"=&gt;[{\"id\"=&gt;\"123\", \"currency_id\"=&gt;\"ARS\", \"title\"=&gt;\"Example T-Shirt\", \"picture_url\"=&gt;\"http://www.site.com/image/123.png\", \"description\"=&gt;\"Red XL T-Shirt\", \"quantity\"=&gt;1, \"unit_price\"=&gt;10.5}], \"client_id\"=&gt;\"963\", \"marketplace\"=&gt;\"NONE\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I make a \"redirect_to\" call to the \"init_point\" url??</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","json","parsing","url","object"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":1,"question_id":12965203,"title":"How to get JSON from webpage into Python script","body":"<p>Got the following code in one of my scripts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#\n# url is defined above.\n#\njsonurl = urlopen(url)\n\n#\n# While trying to debug, I put this in:\n#\nprint jsonurl\n\n#\n# Was hoping text would contain the actual json crap from the URL, but seems not...\n#\ntext = json.loads(jsonurl)\nprint text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially what I want to do is get the {{.....etc.....}} stuff that I see on the URL when I load it in Firefox into my script so I can parse a value out of it.

This probably refers to growing plants in spring. April begins on the same day of week as July in all years and also January in leap years.\n\nApril's flower is the Sweet Pea. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\n\n== April in poetry ==\n\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter. For example: April showers bring May flowers.\n\n== Events in April ==\n\n[[August]]\n\nAugust is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days, the same number of days as the previous month, July, and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.\n\n== The Month ==\n\nThis month was first called Sextilis in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.\n\nAugust is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month.  The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September.\n\nAugust, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other. In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere. In a common year, no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in leap years, February starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as November.\n\nAugust's flower is the Gladiolus with the birthstone being peridot. The astrological signs for August are Leo (July 24 - August 22) and Virgo (August 23 - September 23).\n\n== August observances ==\n\n=== Fixed observances and events ===\n\n=== Moveable and Monthlong events ===\n\n== Selection of Historical Events ==\n\n== References ==\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>April and August are both wiki articles.

Depending on this information I want the parser to build objects which have simple attributes but also complex ones like a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> (space separated), for example <code>Thing</code>s:</p>\n\n<h2>Example data type</h2>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.List;\n\npublic class Thing {\n    protected int           foo;\n    protected String        bar\n    protected List&lt;String&gt;  baz;\n\n    public Thing(int foo, String bar, List&lt;String&gt; baz) {\n        this.foo = foo;\n        this.bar = bar;\n        this.baz = baz;\n    }\n\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"foo: \" + foo + \", bar: \" + bar + \", baz: \" + baz;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The parser's input will be text files with a column line (comma separated) in the first line and the data in the <code>n</code> next lines (comma separated). To simplify testing, I will use <code>Iterator&lt;String&gt;</code> for input lines. This simple test should illustrate what I want to build:</p>\n\n<h2>JUnit test</h2>\n\n<pre><code>// prepare example string iterator\nList&lt;String&gt; lines = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nlines.add(\"bar,baz,foo\");\nlines.add(\"yay,quux quuux,17\");\nlines.add(\"hey,qaax qaaax,42\");\n\n// test parsed things\nList&lt;Thing&gt; things = ThingBuilder.buildThings(lines.iterator());\nassertNotNull(things);\nassertEquals(2, things.size());\nassertEquals(\"foo: 17, bar: yay, baz: [quux, quuux]\", things.get(0).toString());\nassertEquals(\"foo: 42, bar: hey, baz: [qaax, qaaax]\", things.get(1).toString());\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Easiest approach</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>read the first line and split it in column names</li>\n<li>read all other lines and do the following with them:\n<ul>\n<li>split the line in tokens</li>\n<li>loop over them:\n<ul>\n<li>for token <code>i</code> do a big <code>switch</code>/<code>else if</code> on column name <code>i</code> to</li>\n<li>transform token <code>i</code></li>\n<li>store the extracted value somewhere</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>collect everything and build a <code>Thing</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My problem with this approach is the inner switch.

It looks like Boost.Format has really solved the output problem in a good way, but I haven't found anything similarly succinct for input.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","xml","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":12835558,"title":"I was learning xml parser following the android guide, but the sample project prompts error, what could be the reason?","body":"<p>here is the link <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/xml.html</a> , the sample code is at the right for downloading. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I am using wi-fi connection, some ppl suggest disable the LAN card, and i did so, still exceptions... and all the project related to read xml do not work on my emulator.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>it prompt me this error</strong> </p>\n\n<pre><code>10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfo{com.example.android.networkusage/com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity}: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1983)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2084)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.access$600(ActivityThread.java:130)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1195)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4745)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:786)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:553)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825): Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.networkusage.NetworkActivity\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.findClass(BaseDexClassLoader.java:61)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:501)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:461)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.Instrumentation.newActivity(Instrumentation.java:1053)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1974)\n10-11 08:41:43.169: E/AndroidRuntime(825):  ... 11 more\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":201,"score":0,"question_id":9045401,"title":"JParsec bug in parsing simple String expressions","body":"<p>I need a parser for my java application, so I discovered the JParsec library and went through a tutorial on their website with a simple calculator grammar.

The raw template that the above is produced from is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Portland, Indiana\n|native_name              = \n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = \n|image_skyline            = BlueBridge.jpg\n|imagesize                = 250px\n|image_caption            = Meridian (arch) Bridge in the fog\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = \n|image_map                = Jay_County_Indiana_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Portland_Highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location in the state of [[Indiana]]\n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             = \n|coordinates_display      = inline,title\n|coordinates_region       = US-IN\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of countries|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = [[United States]]\n|subdivision_type1        = [[Political divisions of the United States|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Indiana]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Indiana|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Jay County, Indiana|Jay]]\n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Randy Geesaman ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n|leader_title1            = &lt;!-- for places with, say, both a mayor and a city manager --&gt;\n|leader_name1             = \n|leader_title2            = \n|leader_name2             = \n|leader_title3            = \n|leader_name3             = \n|established_title        = &lt;!-- Settled --&gt;\n|established_date         = \n|established_title2       = &lt;!-- Incorporated (town) --&gt;\n|established_date2        = \n|established_title3       = &lt;!-- Incorporated (city) --&gt;\n|established_date3        = \n|area_magnitude           = 1 E7\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 4.65\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 4.65\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0.00\n|area_water_percent       = 0\n|area_urban_sq_mi         = \n|area_metro_sq_mi         = \n|population_as_of         = 2010\n|population_note          = \n|population_total         = 6223\n|population_density_km2   = 604.7\n|population_density_sq_mi = 1566.8\n|population_metro         = \n|population_density_metro_km2     = \n|population_density_metro_sq_mi   = \n|population_urban                 = \n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|latd = 40 |latm = 26 |lats = 2 |latNS = N\n|longd = 84 |longm = 58 |longs = 48 |longEW = W\n|elevation_m              = 277\n|elevation_ft             = 909\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 47371\n|website                  = http://www.thecityofportland.net\n|area_code                = [[Area code 260|260]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 18-61236{{GR|2}}\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0441471{{GR|3}}\n|footnotes                = \n}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To get the results, I first get the template infomation into a dictionary with this function.

Any suggestions are welcome, like I said I'm new to python and I'm sure there are better ways to do what I'm doing.</p>\n\n<p>The results from this function is a dictionary that represents the template, the values are still a mess of free form text. I pass the dictionary to the next function. This is the one I would like most of the advice on - It's a mess and needs cleaned up. The <code>if</code>s and the <code>replace</code>s are all over the place. Before I go and clean that up I was hoping to get any advice or suggestions on other more python ways of doing things.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"\"\"Parse the Infobox settlement template\"\"\"\ndef __parseInfoboxSettlement(self):\n    values = self.__getTemplate(\"Infobox settlement\")\n    settlement = {}\n    settlement['WIKI'] = self.title\n    if values == None:\n        return settlement\n\n    # Get the settlement established date\n    if 'established_date' in values:\n        if 'established_date2' not in values:\n            settlement['ESTABLISHED_DATE'] = self.__parseDate(values['established_date'])\n        else:\n            if len(values['established_date']) &gt;

Basically, I would like to use top-down parsing everywhere except individual statements. The reason for this is order of operations- its a lot easier to implement them with a bottom up, and it is a lot easier to implement everything else with a top-down parser.</p>\n\n<p>The actual implementation of this is as follows: Start with top-down parsing, matching like normal. Then, in one of the rules, there is a rule that is marked as \"bottom-up\". <code>X</code> tokens are taken out of the input lex array, \"crunched\" with bottom-up (aka shift-reduce) into a single token, and that token is placed into the top-down match. The top-down continues on its way with the rest of its match.</p>\n\n<p>My problem/question is how to get this number <code>X</code>. How many tokens do I take out of the input token stream to shift-reduce on? My initial solution was simple- take them until a semicolon is reached. However, what about things like if statements? There is no semicolon at the ends of those expressions.</p>\n\n<p>I'll give an example to my original plan, because it probably just sounds like gibberish.

For example, I have a file which contais a table like this (7 colums: the first two always have data, only one Complexity column has data, only one Financing column has data):</p>\n\n<pre><code>+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| AIH | Value | Complexity                     | Financing       |\n|     |       | Medium | High | Not applicable | MAC/Other | FAE |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| xyz | 12.43 | 12.34  |      |                | 12.34     |     |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| abc | 1.56  |        | 1.56 |                |           | 1.56|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I use PDFBox:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(pathToFile);\nPDFTextStripper s = new PDFTextStripper();\nString content = s.getText(document);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Those two line data would be extracted like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xyz 12.43 12.4312.43\nabc 1.56 1.561.56\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are no white spaces between the last two numbers, but this is not the biggest problem. The problem is that I don't know what the last two numbers mean: Medium, High, Not applicable? MAC/Other, FAE? I don't have the relation between the numbers and their columns.</p>\n\n<p>It is not required for me to use the PDFBox library, so a solution that uses another library is fine. What I want is to be able to parse the file and know what each number parse means.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["parsing","compiler","types","code-generation","semantic-analysis"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":1,"question_id":8184386,"title":"compilers - Instruction Selection for type declarations in AST","body":"<p>I'm learning compilers and creating a code generator for a simple language that deals with two types: characters and integers. </p>\n\n<p>After the user input has been scanned by the scanner and then parsed by the parser, I get an AST representation of the input.

I have my own simple translation script which is called like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $Translate-&gt;text(\"Name\"); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It would return (and echo) a string with a keyword 'Name'. The problem is, for several reasons (name: misstranslations, report, development, translation in situ), I might want to retrieve all strings' keywords that are on a page.

First would be to parse the php code as is using regex. Since I know the bits that I'm looking for, I thing it would be possible. Second one is that, depending on a SESSION variable, I render the html and parse it, so the <code>echo $Translate-&gt;text(Campus);</code> would return something like <code>&lt;span id=\"Translation\"&gt;Campus&lt;/span&gt;</code> and then parse only the html and retrieve all the ids. Can you think about any other way to retrieve the ids before I get on this?.</p>\n\n<p>PS, I <strong>DON'T</strong> want to hardcode all the id's in an array at the beginning or end of a page.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","parsing","csv"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12653624,"title":"Parsing a remote csv line by line ruby","body":"<p>I've got a remote CSV that updates every few hours, it has 1m+ rows and I'm trying to work out if I can download the file line by line and parse it (I'm only interested in the first 500,000 lines) rather than have to download the whole file then process it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","ios","parsing","instruments","ios-ui-automation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":90,"score":2,"question_id":12276323,"title":"How do I enable Javascript syntax check in Apple Instruments","body":"<p>We are using Apple Instruments to automate some of the Test Flows on iPhone devices.

The size of the responses seem to be reasonable (specially 9.4 KB response). It appears that the SBJsonStreamParser breaks when getting a data stream greater than a certain size. The parser succeeds when the response is small (~3KB), but fails when the response is larger (~10KB). \nI used NSLog to verify that in both cases, pulling a small &amp; large stream, the methods  are successfully receiving the full json document - because it looks like [{\"id\": .... 123}]. I'm convinced that the issue is that the data stream is too long.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if I'm using SBJson incorrectly or is this simply a limitation of the parser? Is there anything that I can configure that allows SBJsonStreamParser to not throw an error for larger (but reasonable) data streams &amp; continue to parse the full response?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","parsing","sorting","recursion"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":0,"question_id":12532670,"title":"recursing a dictionary of lists of dictionaries, etc et al (python)","body":"<p>I have a dictionary returned from a yaml configuration file with 4 levels: </p>\n\n<p>item, sections, fields, elements</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"tag\": \"test\", \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section ONE\", \n            \"tag\": \"s1\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section TWO\", \n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field ONE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f1\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field TWO\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f2\", \n                    \"elements\": [\n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e1\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e2\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e3\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e4\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field THREE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f3\", \n                    \"elements\": [\n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e5\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e6\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e7\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }, \n                        {\n                            \"info\": \"This is element ONE\", \n                            \"tag\": \"e8\", \n                            \"type_of\": \"text_field\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ], \n            \"tag\": \"s2\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"info\": \"This is section THREE\", \n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field FOUR\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f4\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field FIVE\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f5\"\n                }, \n                {\n                    \"info\": \"This is field SIX\", \n                    \"tag\": \"f6\"\n                }\n            ], \n            \"tag\": \"s3\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"type_of\": \"custom\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1> </h1>\n\n<pre><code>class T():\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.sections = []\n        self.fields = []\n        self.elements = []\n\ndef rt(y):\n    t = T()\n\n    def recurse(y):\n        for k,v in y.iteritems(): \n            if isinstance(v, list):\n                getattr(t, k).append(v)\n                [recurse(i) for i in v]\n            else:\n                setattr(t, k, v)\n    recurse(y)\n    return t\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I need to recurse a dictionary of lists of dictionaries that have lists of dictionaries, et. al., sort them into their types (and then add a reference to the piece it belongs to, but one problem at a time.) and put into an instance of T.</p>\n\n<p>This works, but doesn't trim out anything, i.e. each section is captured, but all the rest (fields, elements) are captured.
