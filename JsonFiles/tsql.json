Been banging my head against the wall for quite some time on this.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise is it a case of just using loops and bearing with the execution time?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["tsql","sorting","rows","multiple-columns"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13102182,"title":"T-SQL: how to sort table rows based on 2 columns","body":"<p>I'm quite stuck with this problem for sometime now..</p>\n\n<p>How do I sort column A depending on the contents of Column B?</p>\n\n<p>I have this sample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ID  count   columnA     ColumnB\n-----------------------------------\n12  1      A         B\n13  2      C         D\n14  3      B         C\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to sort it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ID  count   ColumnA     ColumnB\n-----------------------------------\n12  1   A       B\n14  3   B       C\n13  2   C       D\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so I need to sort the rows if the previous row of <code>ColumnB</code> = the next row of <code>ColumnA</code></p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking a loop? but can't quite imagine how it will work...</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking it will go like this (maybe)</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT \n    a.ID, a.ColumnA, a.ColumnB\nFROM \n    TableA WITH a (NOLOCK)\nLEFT JOIN \n    TableA b WITH (NOLOCK) ON a.ID = b.ID AND a.counts = b.counts\nWHERE\n    a.columnB = b.ColumnA\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the above code isn't working though and I was thinking more on the lines of...</p>\n\n<pre><code>DECLARE @counts int = 1\nDECLARE @done int = 0\n\n--WHILE @done = 0\nBEGIN\n\nSELECT \n    a.ID, a.ColumnA, a.ColumnB\nFROM \n    TableA WITH a (NOLOCK)  \nLEFT JOIN \n    TableA b WITH (NOLOCK)  ON a.ID = b.ID AND a.counts = @counts\nWHERE \n    a.columnB = b.ColumnA\n\nset @count = @count +1\nEND\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If this was a C code, would be easier for me but T-SQL's syntax is making it a bit harder for a noobie like me.</p>\n\n<p>Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>\n\n<p>Edit: sample code</p>\n\n<pre><code>drop table tablea\ncreate table TableA(\nid int,\ncolA varchar(10),\ncolb varchar(10),\ncounts int\n)\n\ninsert INTO TableA\n(id, cola, colb, counts)\nselect 12, 'Bad', 'Cat', 3\n\ninsert INTO TableA\n(id, cola, colb, counts)\nselect 13, 'Apple', 'Bad', 1\n\ninsert INTO TableA\n(id, cola, colb, counts)\nselect 14, 'Cat', 'Dog', 2\n\nselect * FROM TableA\n\nSELECT a.ID, a.ColA, a.ColB\nFROM TableA a WITH (NOLOCK) \nLEFT JOIN TableA b WITH (NOLOCK) \n     ON a.ID = b.ID\nWhere a.colB = b.ColA\nORDER BY a.ColA ASC\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","tsql","variables"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":2,"question_id":13103264,"title":"TSQL: Find declared length of a variable","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9686525/data-type-size-of-variable-in-sql\">Data type size of variable in sql</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you find the declared max length of a variable using <code>T-SQL</code>?</p>\n\n<p>For example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>DECLARE @myVar varchar(123) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-- How can I find the max length of <code>@myVar</code> would be 123?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","tsql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13102146,"title":"Find rows with 2 or more matching properties in another table","body":"<p>This one is stumping me, I will just go ahead and explain via SQL.

Anytime text is used within the table, instead of storing actual varchar values, ids are stored that relate back to text stored in Table B. This allows me to by adding a languageID column to Table B, have multiple translations for the same row in the database.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<h2>Table A</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Title (int) </li>\n<li>Description (int)</li>\n<li>Other Data....</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Table B</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>TextID (int) - This is the column\nwhose value is stored in other tables</li>\n<li>LanguageID (int)</li>\n<li>Text (varchar)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My question is more a call for suggestions on how to best handle this. Ideally I want a query that I can use to select from the table, and get the text as opposed to the ids of the text out of the table. Currently when I have two text items in the table this is what I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT C.ID, C.Title, D.Text AS Description\nFROM\n(SELECT A.ID, A.Description, B.Text AS Title\nFROM TableA A, TranslationsTable B\nWHERE A.Title = B.TextID AND B.LanguaugeID = 1) C\nLEFT JOIN TranslationsTable D\nON C.Description = D.TextID AND D.LanguaugeID = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This query gives me the row from Table A I am looking for (using where statements in the inner select statement) with the actual text based on the language ID used instead of the text ids.</p>\n\n<p>This works fine when I am only using one or two text items that need to be translated, but adding a third item or more, it starts to get really messy - essentially another left join on top of the example.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on a better query, or at least a good way to handle 3 or more text items in a single row?</p>\n\n<p>Per suggestions, I've added an example of the two tables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Table A  \n    ---------------------------\n    ID    |Title    |Description  \n    ---------------------------  \n    1     |1        |2  \n    ---------------------------  \n    2     |3        |4  \n    --------------------------- \n\n    Table B (Translations Table) \n    ---------------------------\n    ID    |LanguaugeID|Text  \n    ---------------------------  \n    1     |1        |Here is title one\n    ---------------------------  \n    1     |2        |Here is a title one in espanol\n    ---------------------------\n    2     |1        |Here is description one\n    ---------------------------  \n    2     |2        |Here is description one in espanol\n    ---------------------------\n    3     |1        |Title 2\n    ---------------------------  \n    4     |1        |Description 2\n    ---------------------------   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I want is to be able to pull a row out of table A that already has the text from table B, not just the ids -

Selecting distinct col1 and col2 there are 400 columns returned, however when I use his solution 600 rows are returned. I checked the data and in fact there were duplicate pk's.

Let's call them Orders and Items. Order has a Primary key of OrderId and Items has a Primary Key of ItemId. Items.OrderId  is the foreign key to identify the parent Order. An Order can have 1 to n Items.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to provide a very flexible \"query builder\" type interface to the user to allow the user to select what Items he want to see. The filter criteria can be based on fields from the Items table and/or from the parent Order table. If an Item meets the filter condition including and condition on the parent Order if one exists, the Item should be return in the query as well as the parent Order.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, I suppose, most people would construct a join between the Item table and the parent Order tables.  I would like to perform 2 separate queries instead. One to return all of the qualifying Items and the other to return all of the distinct parent Orders. The reason is two fold and you may or may not agree.</p>\n\n<p>The first reason is that I need to query all of the columns in the parent Order table and if I did a single query to join the Orders table to the Items table, I would be repoeating the Order information multiple times. Since there are typically a large number of items per Order, I'd like to avoid this because it would result in much more data being transfered to a fat client. Instead, as mentioned, I would like to return the two tables individually in a dataset and use the two tables within to populate a custom Order and child Items client objects. (I don't know enough about LINQ or Entity Framework yet. I build my objects by hand). The second reason I would like to return two tables instead of one is because I already have another procedure that returns all of the Items for a given OrderId along with the parent Order and I would like to use the same 2-table approach so that I could reuse the client code to populate my custom Order and Client objects from the 2 datatables returned.</p>\n\n<p>What I was hoping to do was this:</p>\n\n<p>Construct a dynamic SQL string on the Client which joins the orders table to the Items table and filters appropriate on each table as specified by the custom filter created on the Winform fat-client app. The SQL build on the client would have looked something like this:</p>\n\n<p>TempSQL = \"</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO #ItemsToQuery\n   OrderId, ItemsId\nFROM\n   Orders, Items \nWHERE\n   Orders.OrderID = Items.OrderId AND\n   /* Some unpredictable Order filters go here */\n  AND\n   /* Some unpredictable Items filters go here */\n\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I would call a stored procedure, </p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE GetItemsAndOrders(@tempSql as text)\n   Execute (@tempSQL) --to create the #ItemsToQuery table\n\nSELECT * FROM Items WHERE Items.ItemId IN (SELECT ItemId FROM #ItemsToQuery)\n\nSELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Orders.OrderId IN (SELECT DISTINCT OrderId FROM #ItemsToQuery)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that #ItemsToQuery table, since it was created by dynamic SQL, is inaccessible from the following 2 static SQLs and if I change the static SQLs to dynamic, no results are passed back to the fat client.</p>\n\n<p>3 around come to mind but I'm look for a better one:</p>\n\n<p>1) The first SQL could be performed by executing the dynamically constructed SQL from the client. The results could then be passed as a table to a modified version of the above stored procedure. I am familiar with passing table data as XML. If I did this, the stored proc could then insert the data into a temporary table using a static SQL that, because it was created by dynamic SQL, could then be queried without issue. (I could also investigate into passing the new Table type param instead of XML.) However, I would like to avoid passing up potentially large lists to a stored procedure.</p>\n\n<p>2) I could perform all the queries from the client. </p>\n\n<p>The first would be something like this:</p>\n\n<p>SELECT Items.* FROM Orders, Items WHERE Order.OrderId = Items.OrderId AND (dynamic filter)\nSELECT Orders.* FROM Orders, Items WHERE Order.OrderId = Items.OrderId AND (dynamic filter)</p>\n\n<p>This still provides me with the ability to reuse my client sided object-population code because the Orders and Items continue to be returned in two different tables.</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling to, that I might have some options using a Table data type within my stored proc, but that is also new to me and I would appreciate a little bit of spoon feeding on that one.</p>\n\n<p>If you even scanned this far in what I wrote, I am surprised, but if so, I woul dappreciate any of your thoughts on how to accomplish this best.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","tsql","full-text-search","temporary-tables"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":660,"score":0,"question_id":4847057,"title":"TSQL - Optimizing Full Text Search query with temp table","body":"<p>To make it short I have a full text search query that does a company search on a single table.

If not, why not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>What it does</strong> Edit 6, on 22 Jul 2011</p>\n\n<p>It suppresses the \"xx rows affected\" message after any DML. This is a resultset and when sent, the client must process it. It's tiny, but measurable (see answers below)</p>\n\n<p>For triggers etc, the client will receive multiple \"xx rows affected\" and this causes all manner of errors for some ORMs, MS Access, JPA etc (see edits below)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n\n<p>General accepted best practice (I thought until this question) is to use <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code> in triggers and stored procedures in SQL Server. We use it everywhere and a quick google shows plenty of SQL Server MVPs agreeing too.</p>\n\n<p>MSDN says this can break a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">.net SQLDataAdapter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this means to me that the SQLDataAdapter is limited to utterly simply CRUD processing because it expects the \"n rows affected\" message to match. So, I can't use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>IF EXISTS to avoid duplicates (no rows affected message) <em>Note: use with caution</em></li>\n<li>WHERE NOT EXISTS (less rows then expected</li>\n<li>Filter out trivial updates (eg no data actually changes)</li>\n<li>Do any table access before (such as logging)</li>\n<li>Hide complexity or denormlisation</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the question marc_s (who knows his SQL stuff) says do not use it. This differs to what I think (and I regard myself as somewhat competent at SQL too).</p>\n\n<p>It's possible I'm missing something (feel free to point out the obvious), but what do you folks out there think?</p>\n\n<p>Note: it's been years since I saw this error because I don't use SQLDataAdapter nowadays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edits after comments and questions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit: More thoughts...</p>\n\n<p>We have multiple clients: one may use a C# SQLDataAdaptor, another may use nHibernate from Java.

For most of my reports this has proven to be a breeze, not even having to write SQL procs for most of my reports (semantic query in BIDS based on model).</p>\n\n<p>However one report remains daunting due to the nature of its input parameters and originally being computed in a function returning a list, not a LINQ query. The goal is to return all people in the people table who are less than x percent busy on any day in the range between date a and date b (variables input by report requester). This busy level information only exists in the Job table which has information on which person it is assigned to, the start and end dates of the job, and its task level. As a result, my original C# function does pretty much the following (psuedo-code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>given startDateRange a, stopDateRange b, busyLevel x\n{\nfor each person in people:\n   List returnPeople = new List()\n   create array consisting of days from a to b\n   for each job in jobs:\n      for each intersecting date of DateRange and job dateRange:\n         add task level of job to array\n   for each day in array:\n      if array[day] &lt; x\n         returnPeople.Add(person)\n         break;\nreturn returnPeople\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Table structure for relevant pieces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>People Table:\n-PersonID (PK)\n-other stuff...\n\nJobs Table:\n-JobID (PK)\n-StartDate\n-StopDate\n-Allocation\n-AssignedPersonID (FK to People Table)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, a job is on someones schedule if that job's AssignedPersonID is = that someone</p>\n\n<p>So... since I'm now working in SSRS 2008, I am looking for guidance on how to get these same results in SSRS from the same input parameters. Some trick to semantic queries that I am currently unaware of? SQL stored proc with temp table or table variable? Some sort of data processing extension? Any information on what the best approach to this type of problem is would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if additional information/code is required.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Currently working on a solution using cursors and temp tables that pretty much copies the structure of my original function. This is DEFINITELY not ideal however due to the complexity and inefficient nature of cursors, so advice/alternatives would be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Found a solution, definitely not the most efficient.

Then without selling the inventory out in July we ordered more again, and therefore that inventory is automatically considered to be aged.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this function is stop what happened above. Which is ordering items that have aged (unsold) inventory. It's also used for evaluating how much of a department is aged and if we should consider starting a sale to get rid of aged items.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that we have no less then 40,000 items to evaluate. This function works great for single items, however it takes 30 seconds for 100 items. I'm hoping someone can come a long and look at my function and realize I'm going about it the completely wrong way.

A good thing.\n        TotalSales = Aged //We carry on the remainder for further evaluation\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope I have been thorough in explaining myself this time. Sorry it's so long.
