Even if you undock the form designer (back to D7 format), just clicking back into the form when code has been changed causes the BDS.exe to max out on CPU for a long time. In my case, on my largest form (30,000 lines) this can be over a minute. I'm not sure what checking is going on when reactivating the form, but if the IDE has been \"told\" that all is uptodate, then the switch is instantaneuos. My workaround is therefore to Ctrl+F9 to compile the form before reactivating the form. The time taken to compile is only a few seconds. I can then switch instantly to the form without issue.

However only on one of the places it runs, on several other systems it runs till the power goes out.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to put in some debug code to narrow the problem down. and found out that the exception is EOutofResources on a save of a file. (the file save can happen thousands of times a day).</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to reason out memory leaks (with fastmm), but since the dataflow is quite high (60MByte/s from gigabit industrial camera's), I can only rule out \"creeping\" memory leaks with fastmm, not quick flashes of memoryleaks that exhaust memory around the time it happens. If something goes wrong, the app fills memory in under half a minute.,</p>\n\n<p>Main suspects are filehandles that are somehow left on some error and  TMetafiles (which are streamed to these files). Minor suspects are VST, popupmenu and tframes</p>\n\n<p>Updates: </p>\n\n<p>Another possible tip: It ran fine for two years with D7, and now the problems are with Turbo Explorer (which I use for stable projects not converted to D2009 ).</p>\n\n<p>Paul-Jan: Since it only happens once a week (and that can happen at night), information acquisition is slow. Which is why I ask this question, need to combine stuff for when I'm there thursday. In short: no I don't know 100% sure. I intend to bring the entire Systemtools collection to see if I can find something (because then it will be running for days). There is also a chance that I see open files. (maybe should try to find some mingw lsof and schedule it)</p>\n\n<p>But the app sees very little GUI action (it is an machine vision inspection app), except screen refresh +/- 15/s which is tbitmap stretchdraw + tmetafile, but I  get this error when saving to disk (TFileStream) handles are probably <i>really</i> exhausted. However in the same stream, TMetafile is also savetostreamed, something which later apps don't have anymore, and they can run from months.  </p>\n\n<p>------------------- UPDATE</p>\n\n<p>I've searched and searched and searched, and managed to reproduce the problems in-vitro two or three times.  The problems happened when memusage was +/- 256MB (the systems have 2GB), user objects 200, gdi objects 500, not one file more open than expected ).</p>\n\n<p>This is not really exceptional. I do notice that I leak small amounts of handles, probably due to reparenting frames (something in the VCL seems to leak HPalette's), but I suspect the core cause is a different problem. I reuse TMetafile, and .clear it inbetween.  I think clearing the metafile doesn't really (always?) resize the resource, eventually each metafile in the entire pool of tmetafile at maximum size, and with 20-40+ tmetafiles (which can be several 100ks each) this will hit the desktop heap limit. </p>\n\n<p>That's theory, but I'll try to verify this by setting the desktop limit to 10MB at the customers, but it will be several weeks before I have confirmation if this changes anything. This theory also confirms why this machine is special (it's possible that this machine naturally has slightly larger metafiles on average). Occasionally freeing and recreating a tmetafile in the pool might also help.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily all these problems (both tmetafile and reparenting) have already been designed out in newer generations of the apps.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the special circumstances (and the fact that I have very limited test windows), this is going to be a while, but I decided to accept the desktop heap as an example for now (though the GDILeaks stuff was also somewhat useful).</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that the audit revealed GDI-types usage in a thread (though only saving tmetafiles (that weren't used or connected otherwise) to streams.</p>\n\n<p>------------- Update 2.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the desktop limit only seemed to minorly increase the time till the problem occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I won't be able to follow up on this further, since the machines were updated to a newer version of the framework that doesn't have the problem.</p>\n\n<p>In summary I can only state what the three core modifications were going from the old to the new framework: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I no longer change screens by reparenting frames. I now work with forms that I hide and show. I changed this since I also had very rare crashes or exceptions (that could be clicked away) due to this. The crashes were all while operating the GUI though, not spontaneously like the main problem</li>\n<li>The routine where the crash happened dealt with TMetafile. TMetafile has been designed out, and replace by a simpler own made format. (basically arrays with Opengl vertices)</li>\n<li>Drawing no longer happened with tbitmap with a tmetafile overlay strechdrawn over it, but using OpenGL.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course it could be something else too, that got changed in the rewrite of the above parts, fixing some very nasty detail bug. It would have to be an extremely bad one, since I analysed the above system as much as I could.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated nov 2012</strong> after some private mail discussion: In retrospect, the next step would have been adding a counter to the metafiles objects, and simply reinstantiate them every x * 1000 uses or so, and see if that changes anything. If you have similar problems, try to see if you can somewhat regularly destroy and reinitialize long living resources that are dynamically allocated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","datetime","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":4,"question_id":13201535,"title":"Why do TTime comparisons give unexpected results?","body":"<p>I have observed some kind of weird behaviour regarding the <code>EncodeDateTime</code> and <code>EncodeTime</code> methods and I am seeking some explanation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure SomeTestCase;\nvar\n    time: TTime;\n    dateTime: TDateTime;\nbegin\n    time := EncodeTime(8, 0, 0, 0);\n    date := EncodeDateTime(2012, 11, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0);\n\n    Assert(time = TimeOf(date)); //Fails\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I've found is that <code>date</code>'s hour portion evaluates to <code>7:59:59</code> instead of <code>8:00:00</code>.

When they came from the vendors (product pictures), they were in CMYK format.

Many original images were also TIFF and were converted to JPG. So it appears that the software <code>FastStone Image Resizer</code> must not properly save these files when they go through. The blue image doesn't happen on all of them, just some random batches at a time.

So I just converted the interface to an array of pointers. </p>\n\n<p>Now the program successfully calls CreateDevice(). I can see this both in the logs and stepping through in Ollydbg.</p>\n\n<p>Now what happens is that when CreateDevice calls the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice() it crashes again. When I debug in Ollydbg I notice that it is dereferencing the pointer once too much. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>\nOk, fixed some pointer issues with PIDirect3D9 vs IDirect3D9 in different places. So the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice() gets called. But it errors with D3DERR_INVALIDCALL!!</p>\n\n<p>So confusing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong>\nOk, with some more debugging it seems that when I call the function an extra parameter gets pushed on the stack. Which makes the first param invalid. This is proved further by DirectX Debugging which says iAdapter parameter invalid (first param).</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4:</strong>\nWith using IntRefToMethPtr() to get the direct pointer to the original CreateDevice call I was able to get it to call with the stacks the same. Same result. It's looking like I've went the wrong route with trying to hook it in Delphi. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 5:</strong>\nRewrote the hooking method. Now I'm just hooking essentially EndScene(). Hook now works fine in a test program (Vertices.exe that came with the hook demo found in the first URL in this post). But in the main game it crashes the game.

As long as it's just me using it I guess there is no big problems, but it's hard to distribute the source to others, and then there's also future changes in Delphi to consider. \nThe rest of this lenghty post is just details about what I'm actually doing :-)</p>\n\n<p>I've changed this in Soap.OPToSOAPDomConv.pas (row 3759)</p>\n\n<pre><code>if SerializeProps then\nbegin\n  { Serialized published properties }\n  Count := GetTypeData(Instance.ClassInfo)^.PropCount;\n  if Count &gt; 0 then\n  begin\n    CheckedElemURI := False;\n    GetMem(PropList, Count * SizeOf(Pointer));\n    try\n      GetPropInfos(Instance.ClassInfo, PropList);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To: (not the prettiest implementation I guess)</p>\n\n<p>New variables in the procedure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Context: TRttiContext;       \nRttiProperty:  TRttiProperty;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Row 3759:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if SerializeProps then\nbegin\n  { Serialized published properties }\n  Count := 0;\n  for RttiProperty in Context.GetType(Instance.ClassInfo).GetProperties do\n  begin\n    if RttiProperty.Visibility = mvPublished then //The old method only read published\n      Count := Count + 1;                         //RTTI scoping [mvPublished] requires changes to\n  end;                                            //soap.InvRegistry\n  begin\n    CheckedElemURI := False;\n    GetMem(PropList, Count * SizeOf(Pointer));\n    try\n      I := 0;\n      for RttiProperty in Context.GetType(Instance.ClassInfo).GetProperties do\n        if RttiProperty.Visibility = mvPublished then\n        begin\n          PropList[I] := TRttiInstanceProperty(RttiProperty).PropInfo;\n          I := I + 1;\n        end;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some details as to what I am doing is probably helpful. The background is that the imported wsdl from the SOAP Web Service generates a huge unit, that consists of about 2000 classes and 300k rows of code. The web service design is out of my control. The WSDL Importer makes all of these classes visible in RTTI, which consumes the RTTI space and the unit won't compile.</p>\n\n<p>I've refactored the code here and there and now have a working implementation. While refactoring I found that I could cut away some 50000 rows of redundant code by using generics. Since Delphi won't compile the imported wsdl \"as is\" anyway I will have to maintain the unit manually whenever new methods becomes available in the web service, so I want to make it as readable as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I'm changing according to below. The sample has very simplified classes, and the sample actually has more lines in the refactored code, but considering the original classes has a lot of procedures etc this method really makes the unit a lot more readable, and it's also easier to compose the classes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>TLCar = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FEngine: string;\n  FName: string;\npublished\n  property Name: string read FName write FName;\n  property Engine: string read FEngine write FEngine;\nend;\n\nTLBicycle = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FPedals: string;\n  FName: string;\npublished\n  property Name: string read FName write FName;\n  property Pedals: string read FPedals write FPedals;\nend;\n\nTListCarRequest = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FreturnedTags: TLCar;\npublished\n  property returnedTags: TLCar read FreturnedTags write FreturnedTags;\nend;\n\nTListBiCycleRequest = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FreturnedTags: TLBicycle;\npublished\n  property returnedTags: TLBicycle read FreturnedTags write FreturnedTags;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TCommonReturnedTags = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FName: string;\npublished\n  property Name: string read FName write FName;\nend;\n\nTLCar = class(TCommonReturnedTags)\nprivate\n  FEngine: string;\npublished\n  property Engine: string read FEngine write FEngine;\nend;\n\nTLBicycle = class(TCommonReturnedTags)\nprivate\n  FPedals: string;\npublished\n  property Pedals: string read FPedals write FPedals;\nend;\n\nTGenericListRequest&lt;T: TCommonReturnedTags, constructor&gt; = class(TRemotable)\nprivate\n  FreturnedTags: T;\npublished\n  property returnedTags: T read FreturnedTags write FreturnedTags;\nend;\n\nTListCarRequest = class(TGenericListRequest&lt;TLCar&gt;)\nend;\n\nTListBiCycleRequest = class(TGenericListRequest&lt;TLBicycle&gt;)\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Dan</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","exception","delphi-xe"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13107428,"title":"Exception ENonAIRException when installing custom package","body":"<p>I have a custom package (which is using FibPlus and IBExpress).

That is not what I am trying to do. I am trying to simply see why so much space is being used to remove what might not be necessary.

It is for downloading purposes and to minimize server load and download times that you want to compress it. I prefer to use <a href=\"http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inno Setup</a> and compress the program inside the install routine itself. Then when it is installed, it is expanded to full size. That both prevents possible detection as a virus and eliminates the extra startup time needed to uncompress the program in memory. Also I code sign both my executable and my install routine and some compression techniques are incompatible with that.</p>\n\n<p>For more info about compressing, see the StackOverflow question:  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/800505/delphi-exe-compressor/800553\">Delphi EXE compressor?</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ldsandon asked me to provide exactly what options I'm using, so here they are:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/img/compilingoptions.jpg\" alt=\"Compiling Options\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/img/linkingoptions.jpg\" alt=\"Linking Options\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","tstringgrid"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":3,"question_id":13060373,"title":"Mouse over stringgrid when dragging?","body":"<p>Parts of my stringgrid are eligible drop targets, and some are not (first row is column headings, first column is a sort of index and subsequent columns may be dropped to).

I'm going to try some rearranging of things to break out some of the functionality into a separate datamodule to see if it's a size limitation (items in the DFM, maybe) or something.

It seems to get itself into a state where one of these modal dialogs is open, positioned in front of the main form, but neither form is responding to messages.  Clicking on either gives a \"bonk\".  The app is running fine, the UI is updating the main form, but you can't do anything.  I guess there is most likely another modal dialog under the main form.  Whether it is one of mine or one from Windows I have no idea.</p>\n\n<p>Other points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the app responds to keyboard shortcuts OK.  One of these shortuts shuts down the app gracefully and this worked.  I have been unable to reproduce the situation since.</li>\n<li>the app has a tray icon.  This responds to right mouse clicks.  If I minimize the app from here the main form minimizes and leaves the modal dialog displayed, still without focus.  If I restore the main form, things are as they were, with neither window having focus.  Alt-tab has similar results. </li>\n<li>platform is Windows 7</li>\n<li>I call DisableProcessWindowsGhosting before any forms are created</li>\n<li><p>I open the modal dialogs with</p>\n\n<pre><code>ModalDialog.PopupParent := MainForm ;\nModalDialog.ShowModal ;\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>I postpone these error dialogs if other modal dialogs are open:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (Application.ModalLevel = 0) then\n    {open modal dialog}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My question has two parts:</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way of programmatically finding out what window has focus?  I could then take some action for this scenario or a last resort I could them provide a shortcut key to bring it to the front or take some evasive action (depending on the dialog) like set the ModalResult to mrCancel.</p>\n\n<p>How can this situation arise?  Normally when I get a modal dialog behind the main form (I can do that by getting the modal dialog to open, minimizing the app from the tray icon, then restoring the app again - the app main form restores in front of the dialog, with the dialog still retaining focus), I can bring it to the front again by clicking on the tray icon, or close it with the <code>Esc</code> key but it didn't work in this case.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong></em>**UPDATE*<em>*</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Misha's fix worked apart from non-delphi dialogs like TSaveDialog.

Then reinstalled again. NO additional tools except CodeSite were installed, not even the databases. Then I created a new project. It contains a button. When I click the button, it runs the TestMe procedure which is defined in an external PAS file called TestUnit.Pas. I added the path to this library in Library Path and Browsing Path. But the Control+Click on TestMe procedure is still not working! If I hover the mouse over the TestMe procedure, the pop-up says \"Declared in TestUnit\", where the 'TestUnit' word is a blue link. If I click it I hear a Windows system sound but the IDE doesn't take me there (to the unit).</p>\n\n<p>The TestMe procedure is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TestMe;\nbegin\n  Beep(800, 500);\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I control+click the Beep procedure, it takes me to Windows.pas. So, this is working.\nPlease let me know if you have in mind a different test.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nAnd now it works! Without any apparent reasons! I just open and closed and compiled the project. But I make no changes to Delphi except these two: AutoSave options-> Editor files and Project Options.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nThis cannot be!!!<br>\nSo, now I can access the TestUnit.pas file when I control+click on TestMe procedure.\nSo, I moved the original PAS file (ExtUtils.pas) that didn't wanted to work in my initial test (before Delphi reinstall) in the same folder where TestUnit.pas is. Guess what: I can open (with control+click) to TestUnit.pas but not the ExtUtils.pas!!!!<br>\nDelphi acts so strange and inconsistent!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nI edited ExtUtils.pas and now I cannot open AGAIN TestUnit.pas.\nKen White won't let me say that Delphi could possible have bugs. So I cannot use the 'bug' together with 'Delphi'. Can anybody put these words together for me?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nI totally removed any reference to ExtUtils.pas - so I restored the project to the point where it worked (with TestUnit). But now the bug persists. Even if few seconds before it worked with TestUnit now its not working again. </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nNow I realize an important thing: in my source code (in the test project) I have a single line of compilable code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);\nbegin\n TestMe;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The blue dots does not appear for this code - as it wouldn't have been compiled. In those few minutes when the program worked, I have seen the blue dots. \nI have also excluded 'AutoSave options-> Editor files and Project Options' as a possible cause for this issue.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<br>\nI have found a way to fix the problem... for few minutes: I move the project and the library in a different folder (any location will do it). The control+click will work for a while. It even works if I put the files back into the original folder. So, it seems that Delphi keeps some kind of cache of some files. As long as the cache is broken and it keeps the cache, control+click won;t work. But when I move the files, it has to recreate that cache so it will work until the issue reappears and it is stored in the cache.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","com","containers","ole","in-place"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":233,"score":1,"question_id":3972044,"title":"Own \"in-place activation\" OLE Server","body":"<p>I just want to create my own OLE server, which support in-place activation. <BR>\ne.g. In <code>TOlecontrol</code> we can do following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OleContainer1.CreateObject('WORD.Document',FALSE);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is ok.

Every time I refactor a giant unit and split it from one unit into two, I can probably search and replace using something like \"notepad++\" to change \"MyOldUnit,\" to \"MyOldUnit,MyNewUnit,\"  but sometimes, that's just not safe to do. It also misses the cases where \"MyOldUnit\" is the last thing in the uses clause (\"uses MyOldUnit;\").</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, search and replacing in files is dangerous business.  If no such tool exists, I am contemplating writing one, using the Castalia delphi parser.

By setting the FoundInGIS tag to 1, I can then filter by this value to find all records that are in DB-SQL but not in DB-Legacy.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that one of our databases is significantly bigger than the others, at 3,310,510 records. lQuery has the correct number of records, however at the end of the procedure lDataSet only has around 2,500,000.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I want to use the cds to make use of the FindKey method, which isn't supported in TADOQuery, however it's not much use if it ignores 1/3 of the records! I'm guessing that there may be an integer overflow somewhere within the DataSetProvider or the ClientDataSet, though it's a bit naughty that it doesn't raise an exception if so! Has anyone else had this kind of issue, and is there a way of sorting it (perhaps by downloading the data in smaller chunks or using another way of populating CDS)?</p>\n\n<p>The SQL-DB in this case is Oracle, but code will also need to work with SQL-Server, though I doubt it's a DB issue.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nI'm getting some slightly different behaviour now. When I try removing some of the fields from the query it runs fine. All of the fields run OK individually, but it just can't handle all of them (which supports my overflow hypothesis). I am now, however getting an exception being raised occasionally. The exception is </p>\n\n<pre><code>'Format '%s' invalid or incompatible with argument'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is misleading, as delving down the Debug DCUs shows the error is being raised by </p>\n\n<pre><code>SafeArrayCheck(SafeArrayCopy(VarToDataPacket(Value), FSavedPacket));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in TCustomClientDataSet.SetData (DBClient line 1482).

This API provides most client functions and a few server functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT), encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS). The basic RTMP specification has been published by Adobe but this API was reverse-engineered without use of the Adobe specification. As such, it may deviate from any published specifications but it usually duplicates the actual behavior of the original Adobe clients.\nThe RTMPDump software package includes a basic client utility program in rtmpdump(1), some sample servers, and a library used to provide programmatic access to the RTMP protocol. This man page gives an overview of the RTMP library routines. These routines are found in the -lrtmp library. Many other routines are also available, but they are not documented yet.\n\nThe basic interaction is as follows. A session handle is created using RTMP_Alloc() and initialized using RTMP_Init(). All session parameters are provided using RTMP_SetupURL(). The network connection is established using RTMP_Connect(), and then the RTMP session is established using RTMP_ConnectStream(). The stream is read using RTMP_Read(). A client can publish a stream by calling RTMP_EnableWrite() before the RTMP_Connect() call, and then using RTMP_Write() after the session is established. While a stream is playing it may be paused and unpaused using RTMP_Pause(). The stream playback position can be moved using RTMP_Seek(). When RTMP_Read() returns 0 bytes, the stream is complete and may be closed using RTMP_Close(). The session handle is freed using RTMP_Free().\n\nAll data is transferred using FLV format. The basic session requires an RTMP URL. The RTMP URL format is of the form\n\n  rtmp[t][e|s]://hostname[:port][/app[/playpath]]\nPlain rtmp, as well as tunneled and encrypted sessions are supported.\n\nAdditional options may be specified by appending space-separated key=value pairs to the URL. Special characters in values may need to be escaped to prevent misinterpretation by the option parser. The escape encoding uses a backslash followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII value of the character. E.g., spaces must be escaped as \\20 and backslashes must be escaped as \\5c.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nNetwork Parameters\n\nThese options define how to connect to the media server.\nsocks=host:port\nUse the specified SOCKS4 proxy.\nConnection Parameters\n\nThese options define the content of the RTMP Connect request packet. If correct values are not provided, the media server will reject the connection attempt.\napp=name\nName of application to connect to on the RTMP server. Overrides the app in the RTMP URL. Sometimes the librtmp URL parser cannot determine the app name automatically, so it must be given explicitly using this option.\ntcUrl=url\nURL of the target stream. Defaults to rtmp[t][e|s]://host[:port]/app.\npageUrl=url\nURL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no value will be sent.\nswfUrl=url\nURL of the SWF player for the media. By default no value will be sent.\nflashVer=version\nVersion of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default is \"LNX 10,0,32,18\".\nconn=type:data\nAppend arbitrary AMF data to the Connect message. The type must be B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or TRUE, respectively. Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or 1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before the value, e.g. NB:myFlag:1. This option may be used multiple times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences. E.g.\n  conn=B:1 conn=S:authMe conn=O:1 conn=NN:code:1.23 conn=NS:flag:ok conn=O:0\nSession Parameters\n\nThese options take effect after the Connect request has succeeded.\nplaypath=path\nOverrides the playpath parsed from the RTMP URL. Sometimes the rtmpdump URL parser cannot determine the correct playpath automatically, so it must be given explicitly using this option.\nplaylist=0|1\nIf the value is 1 or TRUE, issue a set_playlist command before sending the play command. The playlist will just contain the current playpath. If the value is 0 or FALSE, the set_playlist command will not be sent. The default is FALSE.\nlive=0|1\nSpecify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in live streams is possible.\nsubscribe=path\nName of live stream to subscribe to. Defaults to playpath.\nstart=num\nStart at num seconds into the stream. Not valid for live streams.\nstop=num\nStop at num seconds into the stream.\nbuffer=num\nSet buffer time to num milliseconds. The default is 30000.\ntimeout=num\nTimeout the session after num seconds without receiving any data from the server. The default is 120.\nSecurity Parameters\n\nThese options handle additional authentication requests from the server.\ntoken=key\nKey for SecureToken response, used if the server requires SecureToken authentication.\njtv=JSON\nJSON token used by legacy Justin.tv servers. Invokes NetStream.Authenticate.UsherToken\nswfVfy=0|1\nIf the value is 1 or TRUE, the SWF player is retrieved from the specified swfUrl for performing SWF Verification. The SWF hash and size (used in the verification step) are computed automatically. Also the SWF information is cached in a .swfinfo file in the user's home directory, so that it doesn't need to be retrieved and recalculated every time. The .swfinfo file records the SWF URL, the time it was fetched, the modification timestamp of the SWF file, its size, and its hash. By default, the cached info will be used for 30 days before re-checking.\nswfAge=days\nSpecify how many days to use the cached SWF info before re-checking. Use 0 to always check the SWF URL. Note that if the check shows that the SWF file has the same modification timestamp as before, it will not be retrieved again.\nEXAMPLES\n\nAn example character string suitable for use with RTMP_SetupURL():\n  \"rtmp://flashserver:1935/ondemand/thefile swfUrl=http://flashserver/player.swf swfVfy=1\"\nENVIRONMENT\n\nHOME\nThe value of $HOME is used as the location for the .swfinfo file.\nFILES\n\n$HOME/.swfinfo\nCache of SWF Verification information\nSEE ALSO\n\nrtmpdump(1), rtmpgw(8)\nAUTHORS\n\nAndrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team

So, combo box in this case behaves like if some weird autocompletion would be enabled. </p>\n\n<p>I've tracked this down to the <code>EditWndProc</code> where after font change is received <code>WM_SETTEXT</code> message with the text of the second item, but I don't know where it comes from and why with the text of the second item.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is quite specific - what (which method) sends the <code>WM_SETTEXT</code> at font change and how does it know about second item text match when the autocompletion is disabled ?</p>\n\n<p>So far I could reproduce this in Delphi 2009 and Delphi XE3 on Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit with the most recent updates installed.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","delphi","registry"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":251,"score":5,"question_id":12485427,"title":"How to Read/Write Windows 7 Library Locations?","body":"<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Windows 7 you have some special folders for documents, pictures and music etc called Libraries.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not aware of them, basically each Library folder can contain Locations (paths) which are basically shortcuts for each Library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>Documents (Library)</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>E:\\Personal\\Documents <code>(Location)</code></li>\n<li>F:\\Backups\\Documents <code>(Location)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Music (Library)</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>E:\\Media\\Music\\Albums <code>(Location)</code></li>\n<li>E:\\Media\\Music\\Singles <code>(Location)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Pictures (Library)</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>E:\\Media\\Photos <code>(Location)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you click any of these Library folders from Windows Explorer or Start menu, Windows Explorer will show with the Locations defined inside that Library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Task</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I need to be able to do is read the Locations for each Library type, and be able to write back (update) the Library with my own Locations.

I could not find any possible error on my logic or my code. If some one with more experience with Delphi can help me. Maybe some memory manager particular behavior is causing the problem. </p>\n\n<p>A little more explanations: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Memory Allocation Control</strong></p>\n\n<p>Objective: Count how much memory buffer with determined size is all allocated by the system, exemple:</p>\n\n<h2>Buffer Size | Amount of Allocs | Total Memory Used</h2>\n\n<pre><code>325     |       35265      |    11461125    \n23      |       32         |     736\n...     |       ...        |    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How I control the memory allocation and deallocation: </p>\n\n<pre><code>I created an array of integer that goes from 0 to 65365. This array will be used to keep the amount of allocs of the corresponding size.\nFor example, If I call GetMem for a buffer of 523, the Array[523] will increase + 1. \n\nThe GetMem, ReallocMem, AllocMem, the problem is easy to resolve 'cause one of it's parameters is the size of the buffer. So I can use this to increase the position of the array.\n\nThe problem cames with the FreeMem, 'cause the only parameter is the pointer of the buffer. I don't know it's size.\n    - I can't create a list to keep the Pointer and it's size. 'Cause there is SO much allocations, it will be so much expensive to the application keep searching/adding/removing items from this list. And this list must to be protected with critical section etc etc. So no way.\n\nHow I'm trying to solve this problem: \n    Just to remeber I created the array to keep the number off allocations. \n\n    Items:     0                              65365\n               |................................|\n    Addess:   $X                            $(65365x SizeOf(Integer))   \n\n    When allocators methos are called, for example: GetMem(52);\n    I changed the behavior of it, I will alloc the requested size (52), but I'll add here a size of an integer;\n    So I will have:  \n\n    0     4                          56 \n    |.....|...........................|\n       $x           \n\n    In the plus space (0..3) I'll set the address of the corresponding space of the array. In this case the address position $array(52). And I add + (SizeOf(Integer)) to the address result of the GetMem, so it will have access just the 52 bytes that were asked for.\n\n    When the FreeMem are called. What I do is:\n        - Get the pointer asked for deallocation.\n        - Decrease the pointer by the size of the integer\n        - Check if the address of the current pointer is relative to the Array of control address.\n        - If it is, I use the the address and decrease 1 from the Array position\n        - And ask for the FreeMem\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the biggest part of time and systems it's working very well.

It'll create a text file called MemReport in the executable path.\n\n    WARNING: If you use the pointer of the VMT destinated to vmtAutoTable, you should not use the directive TRACEINSTANCES.\n\n    How it works:\n    The feature work in two different approaches:\n    1) Map the memory usage by objects\n    2) Map the memory usage by buffers (Records, strings and so on)\n\n    How are Objects tracked:\n      The TObject.NewInstance was replaced by a new method (TObjectHack.NNewInstanceTrace).\n      So when the creation of an object is called it's redirect to the new method. In this new method is increased the counter of the relative class and change the method in the VMT that is responsible to free the object to a new destructor method (vmtFreeInstance). This new destructor call the decrease of the counter and the old destructor.\n      This way I can know how much of objects of each class are alive in the system.\n\n      (More details about how it deep work can be found in the comments on the code)\n\n    How are Memory Buffer Traced:\n      The GetMem, FreeMem, ReallocMem, AllocMem were replaced by new method that have an special behavior to help track the buffers.\n\n       As the memory allocation use the same method to every kind of memory request, I'm not able to create a single counter to each count of buffer. So, I calculate them base on it size. First I create a array of integer that start on 0 and goes to 65365.\n      When the system ask me to give it a buffer of 65 bytes, I increase the position 65 of the array and the buffer is deallocated I call the decrease of the position of the array corresponding to buffer size. If the size requested to the buffer is bigger or equal to 65365, I'll use the position 65365 of the array.\n\n      (More details about how it deep work can be found in the comments on the code)\n\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Develop by  Rodrigo Farias Rezino\n        E-mail: rodrigofrezino@gmail.com\n        Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/users/225010/saci\n         Please, any bug let me know\n    }\n\n    interface\n    {$DEFINE TRACEBUFFER}    {Directive used to track buffer} //Comment to inactive\n    {$DEFINE TRACEINSTANCES} {Directive used to track objects} //Comment to inactive\n\n    //{$DEFINE WATCHTHREADS} // It's not finished\n\n    uses\n      Classes, SyncObjs, uIntegerList;\n\n      {You can register possibles names for some Buffers Sizes, it can be useful when you are working with record.

I have used the resource a lot in the past, mainly finding answers from questions others have asked. But this time I seem to be a bit stuck.</p>\n\n<p>I can nearly get there with this using examples on here, but not quite :(</p>\n\n<p>So, here is the problem:</p>\n\n<p>We use the Amazon Product Advertising API to do our repricing on their site. For those who don't know it basically lets you interogate the Amazon database without having to do time consuming operations like scraping web pages. It works very well for us, or has. They are now disbanding this API for sellers and moving us to a new API over at their MWS service.</p>\n\n<p>The calls are subtlely different as far as I can see. The 2 obvious differences are that the PA API uses HTTP and GET whereas the MWS is using HTTPS and POST.</p>\n\n<p>I am not entirely sure the examples in the Amazon documentation are correct as they give examples of creating as hash signed URL request. That is the way we used to sucessfully do it on the PA-API where the GET method was used. But can you do that for POST? I don't think that is possible, although I may be wrong and that is certainly what the examples imply.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it (creating a signed URL) doesn't work! So I decided to look along the lines of using some kind of lower level HTTPS POST in Delphi.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched on here and there are several different examples, but I cannot get any of the to work correctly. Some of the examples seem to use INDY 10, unfortunately we are stuck (for compatibility reasons) on INDY 9. I have also looked at the WININET wrapper type functions but I just cannot get a result back other than an exception or errors.</p>\n\n<p>So that is why I am here asking for some help.</p>\n\n<p>How can I make the correctly formatted call to Amazon MWS using Delphi? I have tried examples from pages like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4223839/how-to-make-https-post-request-in-delphi\">How to make https post request in delphi!</a></p>\n\n<p>etc etc all the ones I could find!</p>\n\n<p>But I get errors back like 'Bad request' (exception).</p>\n\n<p>I have tried using Fiddler (as suggested elsewhere) to look at what is happeining but can't quite get my head around it yet (although I can compose a call in it that works!)</p>\n\n<p>You just know how you get to the point where you can't see the wood for the trees? That is me right now - I've been looking at this everyday since Friday and I keep thinking I have the soution and then it doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm looking for some pointers or some direction on this. I don't really want to go upgrading INDY or adding new libraries. I would just prefer to keep things as they are and use what I have available. We are using D2007.</p>\n\n<p>To give an idea what is required, I need to make this kind of call (the GetServiceStatus being the most simple):</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST /Products/2011-10-01?AWSAccessKeyId=&lt;ACCESSKEY&gt;\n  &amp;Action=GetServiceStatus\n  &amp;SellerId=&lt;SELLERID&gt;\n  &amp;SignatureVersion=2\n  &amp;Timestamp=2012-02-14T13%3A26%3A42Z\n  &amp;Version=2011-10-01\n  &amp;Signature=dtAvv595blmv%2FnV0h2Yr5bCGzKYXid0hkOuCmZOb3bc%3D\n  &amp;SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To this endpoint:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mws.amazonservices.co.uk/Products/2011-10-01\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mws.amazonservices.co.uk/Products/2011-10-01</a></p>\n\n<p>I think my problem is in all the examples I have tried I don't know how to set up the call correctly, which is probably why I get the Bad Request errors.</p>\n\n<p>So, a nice simple solution would be most appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks for any help,</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy to answer any questions you have to get a working solution,</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n\n<p>Trevor</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Documentation links and observations:</p>\n\n<p>This is the developer guide for the API:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/en_US/bde/MWSDeveloperGuide._V161846143_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/en_US/bde/MWSDeveloperGuide._V161846143_.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the particular part of the API we will be using (that replaces the current product advertising API):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/en_US/bde/MWSDeveloperGuide._V161846143_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/en_US/bde/MWSDeveloperGuide._V161846143_.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>The most basic of functions here is the GetServiceStatus function. It takes no parameters. But, it still needs to be authenticated and 'signed' using credentials from Amazon (Seller ID, MWS access key and secret key (for generating a signature). My feeling is that if I can get the most simplest of functions to work then the rest will follow. But the problem of authentification is what makes finding a solution so difficult. There's no test account.

Nothing gives me any warning that the parameters are going away.  It seems that a few connections to the ADO dataset, at designtime, jogs the <code>TADOCommand</code> component, in particular, and it \"just breaks on me\".  It is particularly maddening when you're trying to write a query or a command, and you know it works, but the ADO component has decided not to accept \"?\" or \":x\" right now.

Occasionally and not as often, I get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[DCC Fatal Error] Spline.pas(1): F2084 Internal Error: AV062D8ED9-R00000003-0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This indicates <code>Spline.pas</code>, and I think the first error is probably related to the file too, because after getting the first one if I then clean the project, cleaning will fail saying it could not delete <code>Spline.hpp</code>. (I have to close and reopen the IDE.) <code>Spline.hpp</code> just contains the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// CodeGear C++Builder\n// Copyright (c) 1995, 2009 by Embarcadero Technologies, Inc.\n// All rights reserved\n\n// (DO NOT EDIT: machine generated header) 'Spline.pas' rev: 21.00\n\n#ifndef SplineHPP\n#define SplineHPP\n\n#pragma delphiheader begin\n#pragma option push\n#pragma option -w-      // All warnings off\n#pragma option -Vx      // Zero-length empty class member functions\n#pragma pack(push,8)\n#include &lt;System.hpp&gt;   // Pascal unit\n#include &lt;Sysinit.hpp&gt;  // Pascal unit\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and there it stops.  It looks to me like it failed when trying to generate the HPP file.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I always get one of these two failures.</strong>  The second is the only one I can tie to a specific file; the first fails halfway through the project, but I can't see where it got up to when it failed.  I am compiling from inside the IDE.</p>\n\n<p>I've looked in <code>Spline.pas</code>, and it seems pretty basic code - I can't see anything unusual at all. You can <a href=\"http://glscene.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/glscene/trunk/Source/Base/Spline.pas?revision=6065&amp;view=markup\">find it here</a>, and apparently the file <a href=\"http://glscene.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/glscene/trunk/Source/Base/\">hasn't been touched for seven years</a>... so I think it should compile :)</p>\n\n<p>If I change the project settings so it does not generate headers, it compiles fine. (Generating just obj files, and any other of the settings that does not include \"headers\", all work fine.) But this isn't a good workaround for me - after all, I need to use it from C++ Builder, so my normal setting would be \"Generate all C++ Builder files\". At a bare minimum, I need HPP and OBJ files.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone here used GLScene in a recent version of C++ Builder? Have you encountered similar problems?

This variable was finalized when the procedure that owned it finished. This in turn caused a bug due to the lifetime of the variable being longer than I had anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I have a simple project to illustrate some interesting behaviour from the compiler:</p>\n\n<pre><code>program ImplicitInterfaceLocals;\n\n{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\n\nuses\n  Classes;\n\nfunction Create: IInterface;\nbegin\n  Result := TInterfacedObject.Create;\nend;\n\nprocedure StoreToLocal;\nvar\n  I: IInterface;\nbegin\n  I := Create;\nend;\n\nprocedure StoreViaPointerToLocal;\nvar\n  I: IInterface;\n  P: ^IInterface;\nbegin\n  P := @I;\n  P^ := Create;\nend;\n\nbegin\n  StoreToLocal;\n  StoreViaPointerToLocal;\nend.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>StoreToLocal</code> is compiled just as you would imagine. The local variable <code>I</code>, the function's result, is passed as an implicit <code>var</code> parameter to <code>Create</code>. The tidy up for <code>StoreToLocal</code> results in a single call to <code>IntfClear</code>. No surprises there.</p>\n\n<p>However, <code>StoreViaPointerToLocal</code> is treated differently. The compiler creates an implicit local variable which it passes to <code>Create</code>. When <code>Create</code> returns, the assignment to <code>P^</code> is performed. This leaves the routine with two local variables holding references to the interface. The tidy up for <code>StoreViaPointerToLocal</code> results in two calls to <code>IntfClear</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The compiled code for <code>StoreViaPointerToLocal</code> is like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ImplicitInterfaceLocals.dpr.24: begin\n00435C50 55               push ebp\n00435C51 8BEC             mov ebp,esp\n00435C53 6A00             push $00\n00435C55 6A00             push $00\n00435C57 6A00             push $00\n00435C59 33C0             xor eax,eax\n00435C5B 55               push ebp\n00435C5C 689E5C4300       push $00435c9e\n00435C61 64FF30           push dword ptr fs:[eax]\n00435C64 648920           mov fs:[eax],esp\nImplicitInterfaceLocals.dpr.25: P := @I;\n00435C67 8D45FC           lea eax,[ebp-$04]\n00435C6A 8945F8           mov [ebp-$08],eax\nImplicitInterfaceLocals.dpr.26: P^ := Create;\n00435C6D 8D45F4           lea eax,[ebp-$0c]\n00435C70 E873FFFFFF       call Create\n00435C75 8B55F4           mov edx,[ebp-$0c]\n00435C78 8B45F8           mov eax,[ebp-$08]\n00435C7B E81032FDFF       call @IntfCopy\nImplicitInterfaceLocals.dpr.27: end;\n00435C80 33C0             xor eax,eax\n00435C82 5A               pop edx\n00435C83 59               pop ecx\n00435C84 59               pop ecx\n00435C85 648910           mov fs:[eax],edx\n00435C88 68A55C4300       push $00435ca5\n00435C8D 8D45F4           lea eax,[ebp-$0c]\n00435C90 E8E331FDFF       call @IntfClear\n00435C95 8D45FC           lea eax,[ebp-$04]\n00435C98 E8DB31FDFF       call @IntfClear\n00435C9D C3               ret \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can guess as to why the compiler is doing this. When it can prove that assigning to the result variable will not raise an exception (i.e. if the variable is a local) then it uses the result variable directly. Otherwise it uses an implicit local and copies the interface once the function has returned thus ensuring that we don't leak the reference in case of an exception.</p>\n\n<p>But I cannot find any statement of this in the documentation. It matters because interface lifetime is important and as a programmer you need to be able to influence it on occasion.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anybody know if there is any documentation of this behaviour? If not does anyone have any more knowledge of it? How are instance fields handled, I have not checked that yet. Of course I could try it all out for myself but I'm looking for a more formal statement and always prefer to avoid relying on implementation detail worked out by trial and error.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>To answer Remy's question is mattered to me when I needed to finalize the object behind the interface before carrying out another finalization.</p>\n\n<pre><code>begin\n  AcquirePythonGIL;\n  try\n    PyObject := CreatePythonObject;\n    try\n      //do stuff with PyObject\n    finally\n      Finalize(PyObject);\n    end;\n  finally\n    ReleasePythonGIL;\n  end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As written like this it is fine. But in the real code I had a second implicit local which was finalized after the GIL was released and that bombed. I solved the problem by extracting the code inside the Acquire/Release GIL into a separate method and thus narrowed the scope of the interface variable.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","delphi-xe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":222,"score":7,"question_id":11922047,"title":"How to make a list box with Office XP theme like selection rectangle?","body":"<p>What would be the most simple and clean way to show a focused/selected listbox item with a Office XP style?</p>\n\n<p>See this sample image to show the idea more clearer:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/a7E3a.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I think I need to set the Listbox Style to either <code>lbOwnerDrawFixed</code> or <code>lbOwnerDrawVariable</code> and then modify the OnDrawItem event?</p>\n\n<p>This is where I am stuck, I am not really sure what code to write in there, so far I tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TForm1.ListBox1DrawItem(Control: TWinControl; Index: Integer;\n  Rect: TRect; State: TOwnerDrawState);\nbegin\n  with (Control as TListBox).Canvas do\n  begin\n    if odSelected in State then\n    begin\n      Brush.Color := $00FCDDC0;\n      Pen.Color   := $00FF9933;\n      FillRect(Rect);\n    end;\n\n    TextOut(Rect.Left, Rect.Top, TListBox(Control).Items[Index]);\n  end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I should of known that would not work, I get all kind of funky things going on:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/D1csy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong, more importantly what do I need to change to make it work?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","delphi","delphi-7","converter"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":107,"score":2,"question_id":12626434,"title":"how to convert data type byte[] in c to delphi?","body":"<p>This is code I need to convert delphi: </p>\n\n<pre><code>LPBYTE readCharBuff = NULL;\nBYTE readBuffSize;\n\nreadCharBuff = new BYTE[200];\nreadBuffSize    = 200;\n\nreadCharBuff[readBuffSize] = '\\0';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","windows-7","delphi-5","quickreports","xp-mode"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":313,"score":0,"question_id":8613945,"title":"QuickReport and Windows 7 XP Mode","body":"<p>I have an application developed in Delphi 5 that works very well in Windows 7 using the XP Mode, except for one code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TQRCompositeReport.Prepare\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That function only works if I am using an administrator account.\nIf I am using an account that don't have administrator privileges, it works only if the \"XP Mode\" is disabled.\nSince I have some errors runing my app in Windows 7 without XP Mode, I have to activate this option.

So, I added the two necessary units <code>Vcl.Themes</code> and <code>Vcl.Styles</code> to my project's initialization unit (which in this case is NOT the same as the project's main unit), and essentially copied the code from a working application into this new application.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the project's main unit:</p>\n\n<pre><code>program MyServiceApplication;\n\nuses\n  uMyService in 'uMyService.pas' {MyService: TService},\n  uMyServiceMain in 'uMyServiceMain.pas',\n  uMyServiceInit in 'uMyServiceInit.pas',\n  uMyServiceTest in 'uMyServiceTest.pas' {frmMyServiceTest};\n\n{$R *.RES}\n\nbegin\n  RunMyService;\nend.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then in the project's initialization unit:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unit uMyServiceInit;\n\ninterface\n\nuses\n{$IFDEF TESTAPP}\n  Vcl.Forms,\n  Vcl.Themes,\n  Vcl.Styles,\n  uMyServiceTest,\n{$ELSE}\n  Vcl.SvcMgr,\n  uMyService,\n{$ENDIF TESTAPP}\n  uMyServiceMain\n  ;\n\nprocedure RunMyService;\n\nimplementation\n\nprocedure RunMyService;\nbegin\n{$IFDEF TESTAPP}\n  Application.Initialize;\n  Application.MainFormOnTaskbar := True;\n  TStyleManager.TrySetStyle('Carbon'); //&lt;--- WILL NOT RUN - STYLE DOES NOT EXIST\n  Application.Title := 'My Windows Service Application';\n  Application.CreateForm(TfrmMyServiceTest, frmMyServiceTest);\n{$ELSE}\n  if not Application.DelayInitialize or Application.Installing then\n    Application.Initialize;\n  Application.CreateForm(TMyService, MyService);\n{$ENDIF TESTAPP}\n  Application.Run;\nend;\n\nend.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The trouble is, when the application runs, I get an error <code>Style 'Carbon' could not be found.</code> simply because this style has not been included and compiled into the application.</p>\n\n<p>How can I compile this style manually into this application so that the VCL Styles can implement it?</p>\n\n<p>PS: The reason why the initialization is in a separate unit is because if the conditionals were implemented inside the application's main unit, the IDE would <em>destroy</em> the code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>One thing I have tried: I opened a working project's <code>.dproj</code> file and searched for this style <code>carbon</code> hoping to find some configuration for it there, since the working project used this style, but with no luck. The word does not exist anywhere in that file.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","winapi","bitmap","gdi","grayscale"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":913,"score":4,"question_id":8559341,"title":"How to convert bitmap to grayscale by pixel intensity using GDI?","body":"<p>I'm looking for the simple solution of how to convert the 32-bit bitmap to grayscale using GDI (not GDI+).

I have my own server socket VCL component that creates client TWSocket sockets when a new session becomes available.  The client sockets I create do have the Multithreaded property set to TRUE, but all that does is changes the way the client socket handles socket messages to a manner that is safe from a background thread (non-main VCL thread).  TWSocket does not spawn a thread to handle socket data traffic, which is what I need.</p>\n\n<p>I need to have the receive calls occur off the main VCL thread, the main user interface thread, because the incoming data to the client socket is audio data that needs to be processed rapidly, in 50-100 milliseconds or less.  In other words, one hiccup on the main VCL thread and the audio stream is disrupted.  This is why I want to push the OnDataAvailable() event that fires whenever incoming data is available on to a high priority background thread.  In other words, I want to force the message processing loop belonging to the client TWSocket object to a background thread.</p>\n\n<p>I believe I can do this by creating the client socket via a background thread, but I'm hoping to avoid that since currently I use a VCL component I made that acts as a socket server.  This is the entity that Accepts the incoming connection and spawns the client sockets.  The socket server is created on the main VCL thread.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore my question is, is there a (relatively) easy way to create the client sockets so they use an existing background thread to do their socket processing, especially the FD_RECV message handling?  If not an existing background thread, then I will create one for each client socket I create, but I need to know how to make sure the new TWSocket object uses that background thread when it runs its message loop that processes socket messages, so how would I do that?</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","ssl","indy","delphi-5"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":584,"score":1,"question_id":7902152,"title":"Delphi 5 Indy/ics SSL workaround?","body":"<p>I'm getting errors like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"IndyProtocols5 does not use or support IdSSLOpenSSLHeaders..\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>when attempting to install Indy 9 or 10 with my Delphi5 and notice it is a problem for others.

It's almost like it's not going through the 0..63, and instead just retrieving the first value only.</p>\n\n<p>I'm essentially wanting to assign each one to a value within the array as that would allow me to easily read core-specific details without needing to hard code. In the code i had working completely on my development machine, i had to manually go through and use something like this;</p>\n\n<pre><code>if AnsiContainsText(FWbemObject.Name,'3') then\nbegin\n  CoreName[3] := FWbemObject.Name;\n  CoreUsage[3] := FWbemObject.PercentProcessorTime;\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it's hard coded to expect something but would be flaky in systems with 3 CPU's (in the above example). Obviously '3' was replaced with the appropriate array id, all the way from 0 to 63 (though 0 was looking for <code>0,0</code> specifically). The problem with this is that the CPU format is actually of <code>x,y</code> (where <code>x</code> is the CPU and <code>y</code> is the core). It's also not code that i'd be proud to use on the simple basis of it being unreliable. For example, the core name could potentially be <code>0,0 .. 0,7</code> and then <code>1,0 .. 1,7</code> for a system with 2 eight-core CPU's (16 logical cores).</p>\n\n<p>Equally important, the code itself would have been a nightmare to maintain, but could have potentially been shortened down to a single <code>for i :=</code> clause and using <code>IntToStr</code>. But the problem of making sure it works would still remain.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there's a perfectly possible way to do this, but i can't figure it out. I did try using;</p>\n\n<p><code>for VarArrayLowBound(FWbemObject.Name, 1) to VarArrayHighBound(FWbemObject.Name, 1) do</code></p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p><code>for VarArrayLowBound(FWbemObject.PercentProcessorTime, 1) to VarArrayHighBound(FWbemObject.PercentProcessorTime, 1) do</code></p>\n\n<p>but alas, no such luck.

I would like to know whether it is possible in some way to prevent TJvDockServer do docking controls whose class is different from TForm? During a typical docking in Delphi for each event is called OnGetSiteInfo dock and it is possible to filter clients, but there is no such event TJvDockServer. I would be very grateful for your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","delphi","internet-explorer","twebbrowser"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1349,"score":3,"question_id":3432585,"title":"Is TWebBrowser dependant on IE version?","body":"<p>I am thinking about using the TWebBrowser component that comes within Delphi's default pallet of components in a project, but I wonder if it uses the IE version installed on the client machine?</p>\n\n<p>If yes:<br>\nthen I guess it would share its history, cookies, workoffline and stuff like that?<br>\nCan I separate them somehow?<br>\nIs there any webbrowser component that is free and is not shared with Internet Explorer on the client?</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","for-loop","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":138,"score":1,"question_id":12485256,"title":"Delphi 2010 for loop count","body":"<p>I have a problem with a For Loop.

I want to render a particle system. Now I'm using a TMesh which works well enough to display the particles fast. Each particle is represented in the mesh via a two textured triangles. Using different texture coordinates I can show many different particle types with the same mesh. The problem is, that every particle can have its own transparency/opacity. With my current approach I cannot set the tranparency individually for each triangle (or even vertex). What can I do? </p>\n\n<p>I realized that there are some other properties in TMesh.Data.VertexBuffer, like Diffuse or other sets of textures (TexCoord1-3), but these properties are not used (not even initalized) in TMesh. It also seems not easy to simply change this behavior by inheriting from TMesh. It seems one have to inherit from a lower level control to initialize the VertextBuffer with more properties. Before I try that, I'd like to ask if it would be possible to control the transparency of a triangle with that. E.g. can I set a transparent color (Diffuse) or use a transparent texture (TextCoor1)?

Creating one or more worker tasks are well covered by the documentation so that long actions that I invoke from button clicks can be replaced by this demo code (Async, CreateTask etc). Where I am having difficulty though is in how to replace my most 'messy' code which operates as follows.</p>\n\n<p>I have a concept of a single class instance that corresponds to a hardware module. The class publishes one or more properties that expose current values and settings for the hardware. Properties might be read only or read / write. For each of these class instances there can be from zero to several display forms visible. A display form has a TTimer and a built list of the aformentioned published properties. This list is iterated to match up suitably named controls such as labels or edit controls and an RTTI mechanism is used to get and set values between the control and its property. The result is a form which provides a nice UI on to the actual hardware module with the side effect than multiple forms can be open, modifying data on one of them causes the others to show that data shortly after. This property monitoring is performed by the TTimer ticking at 300 ms intervals. Each tick causes it to scan through all properties of the class and to refresh the matching control on its form. The timer runs for the lifetime of the open form. Forms are created when needed and then freed (this has the useful performance optimisation that with no forms open to inspect the hardware, the Application must run as fast as possible because no monitoring tasks can be running).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way of using threading to access my published properties, rather than using a TTimer in the UI thread? Or would synchronisation issues outweigh any advantages? If threading is useful, how would one create a repeating task such as to emulate the ticking timer?</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","mongodb"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12303362,"title":"How can I download a file from MongoDB using delphi mongo-delphi-driver.GridFS.pas?","body":"<p>I'm experimenting with MongoDB and Delphi (<a href=\"https://github.com/gerald-lindsly/mongo-delphi-driver\" rel=\"nofollow\">mongo-delphi-driver</a>)</p>\n\n<p>While I was able to upload a file using the code at bottom, I'm struggling to download it back from MongoDB to my filesystem. </p>\n\n<p>Does someone has already a code snippet that can show to me?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all in advance</p>\n\n<pre><code>uses\n  ...\n  MongoDB, MongoBson, GridFS;\n\n...\n\nprocedure UploadFile();\nconst\n  LOCAL_FILE_NAME = 'C:\\local_file_name'; \n  REMOTE_FILE_NAME = 'remote_file_name';\nvar\n  GridFSStoreFileSuccess: Boolean;\n  myGridFS: TGridFS;\nbegin\n  myGridFS := TGridFS.Create(mongo, db);\n  try\n    GridFSStoreFileSuccess := myGridFS.storeFile(LOCAL_FILE_NAME, REMOTE_FILE_NAME);\n    if GridFSStoreFileSuccess then\n      ShowMessage('File upload was successful!')\n    else\n      ShowMessage('File upload was *NOT* successful!');\n  finally\n    myGridFS.Free;\n  end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","delphi","formatting"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":120,"score":0,"question_id":12300586,"title":"What is the C# equivalent to Delphi's FormatFloat?","body":"<p>I'm porting some Delphi code to C#.

Here is the declaration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type\n  MyThread = class(TThread)\n  public\n    constructor Create(HostLine: string);\n  protected\n    procedure Execute; override;\n    procedure MainControl(Sender: TObject);\n  private\n    Host: string;\n    function CheckPOPHost: boolean; //this is the problematic function\n  end;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the function is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function MyThread.CheckPOPHost: boolean;\nvar\n  MySocket: TClientSocket;\n  SockStream: TWinSocketStream;\n  Buffer: array[0..1023] of Char;\n  ReceivedText: string;\nbegin\n  Result:= false;\n  FillChar(Buffer, SizeOf(Buffer), #0);\n  MySocket:= TClientSocket.Create(Nil);\n  MySocket.Port:= 110;\n  MySocket.ClientType:= ctBlocking;\n  MySocket.Host:= Host;\n  MySocket.Active:= true;\n  if (MySocket.Socket.Connected = true) then\n    begin\n      SockStream := TWinSocketStream.Create(MySocket.Socket, 1000);\n      SockStream.WaitForData(10000);\n      while (SockStream.Read(Buffer, SizeOf(Buffer)) &lt;&gt; 0) do\n        ReceivedText:= ReceivedText + Buffer;\n      if Length(ReceivedText) &gt; 0 then\n        ReceivedText:= PAnsiChar(ReceivedText);\n      if AnsiStartsStr('+', ReceivedText) then\n        Result:= true;\n    end;\n  SockStream.Free;\n  MySocket.Free;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, you don't need to read if don't want to. But I'm connecting into some remote host, and receiving it's text, if the text received begins with '+' symbol (default for POP3 servers), I return true... But when I try to do this inside Thread.Execute:</p>\n\n<pre><code> if CheckPOPHost = true then\n    begin\n      Form1.Memo1.Lines.Append('Valid HOST:: '+Host);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just don't work. I think is good to remember, that if inside the function, instead of doing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  if AnsiStartsStr('+', ReceivedText) then\n    Result:= true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  if AnsiStartsStr('+', ReceivedText) then\n    Form1.Memo1.Lines.Append('Valid HOST:: '+Host);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It works normally... What's happening?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:: I'm getting error on 'if CheckPOPHost = true then' line. For some unknown reason it's giving Access Violation error.</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1433,"score":3,"question_id":4381652,"title":"Delphi 2010/XE Out of Stack Space error on bds:/default.htm","body":"<p>I get an 'Out of Stack Space' fatal error each time i try to run Delphi 2010/XE after i have cleaned/erease the temp IE/index files with a shell tool i have (SpeedCommander).

The most important VCL component characteristic I need is the ability to declare design time properties that allow the user to add code stubs via a Property Editor by double-clicking on a particular method property.  For example, the component might have an OnInitialize() method that executes once the underlying SDK library is ready for use.  The programmer would double-click on that property name and fill in the code to execute when that method fires at run-time.

That means that Windows 7 lies to the programs that run on top of it. It gives you another version of the file, that isn't the one you want. This can be deadly in several ways; One; You recompile a BPL but that's not the one that loads. The BPL that was killing me was in the SysWow64 folder that was part of the VirtualStore. Note that the virtualstore basically makes phantom files appear that are only there if you're a certain \"low privelege\" program, which Delphi 2007 on Win7/64 bit, apparently is.

Now, this was grabbed from the \"Downloads\" section of the DCEF Google Code page.</p>\n\n<p>First thing I noticed was that the site mentions that Delphi XE is supported, but there is no project package included specifically for XE. Naturally, I installed the package meant for Delphi 2010, as the one for XE2 won't work due to FMX, and perhaps a few other things (?).</p>\n\n<p>Having used an older build on D7 in the past, I naturally dropped a TChromium on the form, set the default URL to <code>http://foundry-local/assist/node/</code>, and ran the app. Here's what I was greeted with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exception EExternal Exception in libcef.dll ... External Exception 80000003.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Couldn't post anything in their new Google Group (they disabled the issue tracker on the Code page), so I thought I'd come here to figure out what happened. But just before that, I decided to checkout the latest code-build from the trunk. Installed it successfully (still no package for XE), dropped a TChromium on a blank form, and ran the app. This time I was greeted as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exception EReadError in module FoundryAssistNodeManager.exe at 0004BE24. Error reading Chromium1.Options.AcceleratedCompositingEnabled: Invalid property path.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And hence: I am really confuzzled.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Edit: The app can see the core libraries, and they are being picked up.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Has anybody else been having problems using DCEF on Delphi XE? If so, anyone had some kind of solution?</p>\n\n<p>See, I'm building a customised help platform for my to-be-released products. Using IE is unreliable, and Gecko's components are no longer in development.</p>\n\n<p>Any tips, guidelines would be great. Thanking you all in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","debugging","com","asp-classic"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12158778,"title":"Debuggin ISAPI dll in delphi 2006 fails when dll instatiated via COM","body":"<p>We have a delphi ISAPI dll web app that runs in IIS.

(It can be found <a href=\"https://forums.embarcadero.com/thread.jspa?threadID=65247&amp;tstart=105\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) I would like to send a picture using these components and the best approach seems to be using TMemoryStream. If I send strings, the connection works fine, the strings are transmitted successfully, however when I change it to Stream instead, it doesn't work. Here is the code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Server</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TMainForm.IdTCPServerExecute(AContext: TIdContext);\nvar rcvdMsg: string;\n  ms:TMemoryStream;\nbegin\n// This commented code is working, it receives and sends strings.\n//  rcvdMsg:=AContext.Connection.IOHandler.ReadLn;\n//  LogMessage('&lt;ServerExec&gt; '+rcvdMsg);\n//\n//  TResponseSync.SendResponse(AContext, rcvdMsg);\n  try\n    ms:=TMemoryStream.Create;\n    AContext.Connection.IOHandler.ReadStream(ms);\n\n    ms.SaveToFile('c:\\networked.bmp');\n  except\n    LogMessage('Failed to receive',clred);\n  end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Client</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TfrmMain.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);\nvar ms: TMemoryStream;\n    bmp: TBitmap;\n    pic: TPicture;\n    s: string;\nbegin\n  // Again, this code is working for sending strings.\n  // s:=edMsg.Text;\n  // Client.IOHandler.WriteLn(s);\n  ms:=TMemoryStream.Create;\n\n  pic:=TPicture.Create;\n  pic.LoadFromFile('c:\\Back.png');\n\n  bmp:=TBitmap.Create;\n  bmp.Width:=pic.Width;\n  bmp.Height:=pic.Height;\n  bmp.Canvas.Draw(0,0,pic.Graphic);\n\n  bmp.SaveToStream(ms);\n  ms.Position:=0;\n  Client.IOHandler.Write(ms);\n  ms.Free;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I try to send the stream from the client, nothing observable happens (breakpoint in the OnExecute doesn't fire). However, when closing the programs(after sending the MemoryStream), two things happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the Client is closed first, only then does the <code>except</code> part get processed (the log displays the 'Failed to receive' error. However, even if I place a breakpoint on the first line of the try-except block, it somehow gets skipped and only the error is displayed).</li>\n<li>If the Server is closed first, the IDE doesn't change back from <em>debug</em>, Client doesn't change its state to <em>disconnected</em> (as it normally does when server disconnects) and after the Client is closed as well, an Access Violation error from the Server app appears. I guess this means that there is a thread of the Server still running and maintaining the connection. But no matter how much time i give it, it never completes the task of receiving the MemoryStream.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: The server uses <code>IdSchedulerOfThreadDefault</code> and <code>IdAntiFreeze</code>, if that matters.</p>\n\n<p>As I can't find any reliable source of help for the revamped Indy 10 (it all appears to apply for the older Indy 10, or even Indy 9), I hope you can tell me what is wrong.

I don't want to calculate it based on all downloads, because speed may change over that time. Therefore, I'm just checking the last 20.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":142,"score":3,"question_id":12144309,"title":"How to determine if the Windows 7 Desktop has an ActiveWindow","body":"<p>Is there a way to determine if the desktop has a foreground window?</p>\n\n<p>This works but it seems incorrect?\nWhen there are no foreground windows on my desktop handle returns 328992.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Handle := GetForegroundWindow;\nif Handle = 328992 then\nbegin\n  MessageBox(0, 'There is no active window.', 'No Active Window',   MB_ICONWARNING or MB_OK);\n  exit;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is the best way to accomplish this?\nDelphi 2010</p>\n\n<p>Followup:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iDesktopWindow := GetDesktopWindow;\niShellWindow := GetShellWindow;\niForegroundWindow := GetForegroundWindow;\nShowMessage('DesktopWindow: ' + IntToStr(iDesktopWindow));\nShowMessage('ShellWindow: ' + IntToStr(iShellWindow));\nShowMessage('ForegroundWindow: ' + IntToStr(iForegroundWindow));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>DesktopWindow returns 65552 \nShellWindow returns 65864\nForegroundWindow returns 65724</p>\n\n<p>My previous edit showed a different value for ForegroundWindow each time the app was run, but I failed to minimise the application before getting the value.

The shop which sold me the adapter also provided a test application, which is written in Delphi, compiled with Borland Delphi v6.0. It works perfectly, but my code for some reason does not.<br>\nWhen you use MDB you have to send <code>POLL</code> command every 200ms. If everything is OK, the Coin changer sends <code>ACK</code>. When I send it using Delphi application the session looks like this:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>=> 0x0B* 0x0B (The star character means parity set to Mark.

Both worked well for me. But I now need new tools that will work with Delphi 2009. </p>\n\n<p>The leader in Profiling/Analysis tools for Delphi by a wide margin is obviously <a href=\"http://www.automatedqa.com/products/aqtime/index.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">AQTime by AutomatedQA</a>. They recently even gobbled up <a href=\"http://www.scip.be/index.php?Page=ArticlesDelphi07&amp;Lang=EN\" rel=\"nofollow\">Memproof by Atanas Soyanov</a>, which I understood was an excellent and free memory analysis tool, and incorporated its functionality into AQTime. But AQTime is very expensive for an individual programmer. It actually costs more than the upgrade to Delphi 2009 cost!</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Are there other less expensive options to do profiling and memory analysis in current versions of Delphi that you are happy with and recommend, or should I bite the bullet and pay the big bucks for AQTime?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>Addenum: It seems the early answerers are indicating that the FastMM manager already included in Delphi is very good for finding memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p>So then, are there any good alternatives for source code profiling?  </p>\n\n<p>One I'm curious about is <a href=\"http://www.prodelphi.de/indexpd.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ProDelphi by Michael Adolph</a> which is less than one sixth the cost of AQTime. Do you use it? Is AQTime worth paying six times as much?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>Addenum 2: I downloaded trial versions of both AQTime and ProDelphi.</p>\n\n<p>AQTime was a bit overwhelming and a little confusing at first. It took a few hours to find some of the tricks needed to hook it up. </p>\n\n<p>ProDelphi was very much like the GpProfile that I was used to. But its windows are cluttered and confusing and it's not quite as nice as GpProfile.</p>\n\n<p>To me the big differences seem to be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>ProDelphi changes your code. AQTime does not. Changing code may corrupt your data if something goes wrong, but my experience with GpProfile was that it never happened to me. Plus one for AQTime.</p></li>\n<li><p>ProDelphi requires you turn optimization off. But what you want to profile is your program with optimization on, the way it will be run. Plus one for AQTime.</p></li>\n<li><p>ProDelphi only can profile down to the function or procedure. AQTime can go down to individual lines. Plus 2 for AQTime.</p></li>\n<li><p>ProDelphi has a free version that will profile 20 routines, and its pro version costs less than $100 USD. AQTime is $600 USD.  Plus 4 for ProDelphi.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The score is now 4-4. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>Addenum 3: Primoz Gabrijelcic is planning to get GpProfile working again.

Basically, here is what I have:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2012/32/1344440638-urlsloader.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2012/32/1344440638-urlsloader.png</a></p>\n\n<p>The user clicks on <strong>Load URLs</strong> and the URLs are stocked in the following record:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type TVirtualList=record\n  Item:Integer; // Index\n  SubItem1:String; // Status\n  SubItem2:String; // URL\nend;\n\n...\n\nvar\n LURLs : Array of TVirtualList;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the record is used to fill the Virtual Listview. Here is the OnData code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>procedure TForm1.ListViewData(Sender: TObject; Item: TListItem);\nbegin\n Item.Caption := IntToStr(LURLs[Item.Index].Item);\n Item.SubItems.Add(LURLs[Item.Index].SubItem1);\n Item.SubItems.Add(LURLs[Item.Index].SubItem2);\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user clicks on <strong>GO</strong>, the app will launch one thread that will control the creation of worker threads. Each worker thread takes a URL, downloads it and parses it for getting further info.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here is my problem: the memory consumption always gets higher and higher -- at least, according to the Task Manager. If I minimize the app and open it again, the memory consumption gets back to normal... but the virtual memory consumption stays super high. Now, I know many people say that the Task Manager is unreliable. Yet, after a while, the memory consumption gets so high that the URLs cannot be downloaded anymore. I get an <strong>EOutOfMemory</strong> error. My computer gets super slow.</p>\n\n<p>According to FastMM4, there is no memory leak.</p>\n\n<p>And here is the funny thing: if I clear the TVirtualList record, the memory consumption -- both the \"normal\" one and the virtual one -- gets back to normal. But unless I do that, it stays super high. Obviously, this is a problem since I want the app to be able to download thousands and thousands of URLs; but with this bug, I can't go too far.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code to clear TVirtualList record</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>ListView.Items.BeginUpdate;\nSetLength(LURLs,0);\nListView.Items.Count := Length(LURLs);\nListView.Clear;\nListView.Items.EndUpdate;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So I stripped down the app to the essential.

But when I tried to let it forward the request to other proxy servers from the free proxy servers list on web. Most servers which can be used through IE proxy setting return 403 error message to my proxy server. In fact I have tried about 20 valid proxy servers, but only two can accept the requests from my proxy server.

But still do not know how to make it works...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Updated on 2012/08/07</p>\n\n<p>Hi, I am not really familiar with those HTTP stuffs, so I just record what I saw in wireshark here. It seems IE uses <code>GET/POST</code> commands for <code>HTTP</code> requests and <code>CONNECT</code> command for <code>HTTPS</code> requests. And most proxy servers block Connect commands when they are not HTTPS request (For example, CONNECT www.google.com.tw:80 HTTP/1.0). That is why <code>TIdConnectThroughHttpProxy</code> always does not work.  </p>\n\n<p>Below is my workaround, I made a little bit changes in IdHTTPProxyServer.pas. Hope it is useful for someone else who meets the same problems.</p>\n\n<p>For CONNECT commands, still use <code>TIdConnectThroughHttpProxy</code></p>\n\n<p>Within <code>TIdHTTPProxyServer.CommandCONNECT</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>if UseProxy = True then\nbegin\n     tempIO := TIdIOHandlerStack.Create(LContext.FOutboundClient);\n     tempProxy := TIdConnectThroughHttpProxy.Create(LContext.FOutboundClient);\n     tempProxy.Enabled := True;\n       tempProxy.Host := UseProxyAddr;\n       tempProxy.Port := UseProxyPort ;\n       tempIO.TransparentProxy  :=  tempProxy;\n       LContext.FOutboundClient.IOHandler :=  tempIO;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For <code>GET/POST</code> commands, I should directly send GET www.google.com.tw:80 HTTP/1.0 to other proxy servers instead of sending CONNECT www.google.com.tw:80 HTTP/1.0 at first.</p>\n\n<p>Within <code>TIdHTTPProxyServer.CommandPassThrough</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>  if UseProxy = True then\n  begin\n     TIdTCPClient(LContext.FOutboundClient).Host := UseProxyAddr;\n     TIdTCPClient(LContext.FOutboundClient).Port := UseProxyPort;\n  end else\n  begin\n     TIdTCPClient(LContext.FOutboundClient).Host := LURI.Host;\n     TIdTCPClient(LContext.FOutboundClient).Port := IndyStrToInt(LURI.Port, 80);\n  end;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also within <code>TIdHTTPProxyServer.CommandPassThrough</code>, I should let header <code>Proxy-Connection = close</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>LContext.Connection.IOHandler.Capture(LContext.Headers, '', False);      \nLContext.Headers.Values['Proxy-Connection'] := 'close';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally within <code>TIdHTTPProxyServer.TransferData</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>if AContext.TransferSource = tsClient then \nbegin\n\n  if UseProxy = True then\n  begin\n     ADest.IOHandler.WriteLn(AContext.Command + ' ' + AContext.Target + ' HTTP/1.0'); \n  end else\n  begin\n      ADest.IOHandler.WriteLn(AContext.Command + ' ' + AContext.Document + ' HTTP/1.0'); \n  end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is my first time to implement delphi, and hope there are better solutions.

A change in the color palette affects only the charts; all pre-generated charts are invalid now, out of date, but  regenerating them does not require any additional step: no need for a new simulation run. On the other hand, modifying the input data should invalidate all intermediate steps and all final results.\nThe idea is to regenerate just the required intermediate steps that are out of date.\nThis is what \"make\" does for files and commands.
