There are no image files in the app at all (yet). I've been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and I'm looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.</p>\n\n<h1>Game Setup</h1>\n\n<p>At a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game (towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc) are also subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.</p>\n\n<p>I keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each object's state is updated in the main game loop (fired by an <code>NSTimer</code> at 60-240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting). The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.</p>\n\n<p>I handle view updates using a <code>CADisplayLink</code> timer at the native refresh rate (60 Hz), which calls <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override <code>drawRect:</code> to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapon's new state.</p>\n\n<h1>Performance Issues</h1>\n\n<p>Testing on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS (the target frame rate), usually into the 10-20 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Using Instruments I've determined that only roughly 5% of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state -- the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the <code>CGContextDrawPath</code> function (which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done) is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.</p>\n\n<p>From some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isn't up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive (especially when drawing things that aren't opaque and have some alpha value &lt; 1.0). I'm almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but it's pretty low level and I'm not really excited to have to use it -- it doesn't seem like it should be necessary for what I'm doing here.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphics?</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>Some Ideas...</h2>\n\n<p>Someone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single <code>CALayer</code> instead of having each object on its own <code>CALayer</code>, but I'm not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a theory that using <code>CGAffineTransforms</code> to do my animation (i.e. draw the object's shape(s) in <code>drawRect:</code> once, then do transforms to move/rotate/resize its layer in subsequent frames) would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I don't think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>To give you a feel for the level of drawing I'm doing, here's an example of the <code>drawRect:</code> implementation for one of my weapon objects (a \"beam\" fired from a tower).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: this beam can be \"retargeted\" and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n\n    // Draw beam\n    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(c, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor);\n    CGContextSetLineWidth(c, self.width);\n    CGContextMoveToPoint(c, self.origin.x, self.origin.y);\n    CGPoint vector = [TDBoard vectorFromPoint:self.origin toPoint:self.destination];\n    double magnitude = sqrt(pow(self.board.frame.size.width, 2) + pow(self.board.frame.size.height, 2));\n    CGContextAddLineToPoint(c, self.origin.x+magnitude*vector.x, self.origin.y+magnitude*vector.y);\n    CGContextStrokePath(c);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Instruments Run</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a while:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The <code>TDGreenBeam</code> class has the exact <code>drawRect:</code> implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2b1y3512341d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full Size Screenshot</a></strong>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSw3j.png\" alt=\"Instruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode","interface-builder"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13275144,"title":"How to make xib compatible with both iphone 5 and iphone 4 devices","body":"<p>I am trying to layout my xib so that layout fits in both iphone 5 (4 inches retina) and 3.5 devices. </p>\n\n<p>Because I have to support IOS-5 I cannot use autosizing.

Below is the C# code that handles the calculation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyClass\n{       \n    static public void Add(int a, int b)\n    {\n        updateResult(a + b);\n    }\n\n    [DllImport(\"__Internal\", EntryPoint=\"updateResult\")]\n    static extern public void updateResult(int result);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my code that initializes mono and handles the add method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@implementation Mono\n\n- (id)init {\nself = [super init];\n\nif (self) {\n    NSBundle *main = [NSBundle mainBundle];\n    NSString *path = [main bundlePath];\n    const char *c_path = [path UTF8String];\n\n    [main autorelease];\n    [path autorelease];\n\n    chdir (c_path);\n    setenv (\"MONO_PATH\", c_path, 1);\n    setenv (\"MONO_XMLSERIALIZER_THS\", \"no\", 1);\n    setenv (\"DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH\", \"1\", 1);\n    setenv (\"MONO_REFLECTION_SERIALIZER\", \"yes\", 1);\n\n#if defined (__arm__)\n    mono_aot_register_module (mono_aot_module_mscorlib_info);\n    mono_aot_register_module (mono_aot_module_Math_info);\n\n    mono_jit_set_aot_only (TRUE);\n#endif\n    mono_jit_init(\"MonoTouch\");\n    MonoAssembly *assembly = mono_assembly_open(\"Math.dll\", NULL);\n    MonoImage *img = mono_assembly_get_image(assembly);\n    MonoClass *cls = mono_class_from_name(img, \"Math\", \"MyClass\");\n    MonoMethodDesc *methodDesc = mono_method_desc_new(\"Math.MyClass:Add\", TRUE);\n    _addMethod = mono_method_desc_search_in_class(methodDesc, cls);\n}\n\nreturn self;\n} \n\n- (void)addA:(int)a plusB:(int)b {\n    void *params[] = { &amp;a, &amp;b };\n    mono_runtime_invoke(_addMethod, NULL, params, NULL);\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and here is the definition of the updateResults method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extern void updateResult(int result) {\n    printf(\"Got Result\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the updateResults is called from the C# side of things I get the following exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Unhandled Exception: System.EntryPointNotFoundException: updateResult\nat (wrapper managed-to-native) Math.MyClass:updateResult (int)\nat Math.MyClass.Add (Int32 a, Int32 b) [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can see the symbol in the binary with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ nm Calc | grep updateResult\n00002b2e t _updateResult\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Setting the MONO_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to debug I get the following output when attempting the PInvoke.

What can I do to speed up time it takes to start the initial recording.</p>\n\n<p>I initialized the recorder in viewDidLoad:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    NSString *fileName = @\"test.aiff\";\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    NSString *docsDir = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(\n                    NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0];\n\n    NSString *soundFile = [docsDir\n                               stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName];\n\n    NSURL *soundFileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:soundFile];\n\n    NSDictionary *recordSettings = [NSDictionary \n                                    dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:\n                                    [NSNumber numberWithInt:AVAudioQualityMin],\n                                    AVEncoderAudioQualityKey,\n                                    [NSNumber numberWithInt:16], \n                                    AVEncoderBitRateKey,\n                                    [NSNumber numberWithInt: 2], \n                                    AVNumberOfChannelsKey,\n                                    [NSNumber numberWithFloat:44100.0], \n                                    AVSampleRateKey,\n                                    nil];\n\n    NSError *error = nil;\n\n    audioRecorder = [[AVAudioRecorder alloc]\n                     initWithURL:soundFileURL\n                     settings:recordSettings\n                     error:&amp;error];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when I'm ready i start the recorder by calling my startRecoring method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void) startRecording{\n    NSLog(@\"Trying to start Recording\");\n    [audioRecorder record];\n    NSLog(@\"Recording started\");\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the Log output and you can see that there is roughly 2.5 seconds between the two NSLog calls.

Select an image in your image library, select \"Edit\", and crop the image. When you get the ALAsset you'll get the full image, and if you sync using iPhoto, iPhoto also pulls the full image.

Can somebody please provide some sample code for this when you choose Utility Based Application from the new project window when you open xcode.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","file","itunes","music"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13270928,"title":"Deliver iPhone app with song","body":"<p>We have developed an app which we want to offer in the app store.

Even now I get an empty body and the Restkit log says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-11-06 19:28:03.231 MyProject OAuth[22205:11603] I\n  restkit.network:RKRequest.m:689 Status Code: 404</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not know where I am going wrong or what else to try! Looking forward for help in resolving this issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nI implemented a missing callback method and now am getting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The request must be signed\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>message.

I have read on numerous posts that a PanGestureRecognizer is the way to go, but have been having a very difficult time with it.</p>\n\n<p>In Storyboard, I created my ViewController and added a PanGestureRecognizer to the ViewController and added an action.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my .h:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface PanViewController : UIViewController\n- (IBAction)PanGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)recognizer;\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my .m:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface PanViewController ()\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *PhotoBundle;\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *PhotoArray;\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *ImgViewArray;\n@end\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n[super viewDidLoad];\n// Do any additional setup after loading the view.\n//set i to the correct range if needed.\nif (i &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &lt;= _PhotoArray.count) {\n\n}\nelse i = 0;\n\n//create photo bundle from directory\n_PhotoBundle = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathsForResourcesOfType:@\".jpg\"inDirectory:@\"Otter_Images\"];\n//create array from bundle of paths.\n_PhotoArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:_PhotoBundle.count];\nfor (NSString* path in _PhotoBundle)\n{\n    [_PhotoArray addObject:[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:path]];\n}\n\n//create initial image view\nUIImage *currentImage = [[UIImage alloc] init];\ncurrentImage = [_PhotoArray objectAtIndex:i];\nUIImageView *currentIV = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(100,100, 100, 100)];\n[currentIV setImage:currentImage];\n[self.view addSubview:currentIV];\n//increment i to progress through array.\ni++;\n}\n\n- (IBAction)PanGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)recognizer {\n    [self GestureDirection:recognizer];\n}\n\n- (void)GestureDirection:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer\n{\nCGPoint direction = [gestureRecognizer velocityInView:self.view];\n\nif(direction.x &gt; 0)\n{\n    NSLog(@\"gesture went right\");\n    UIImage *nextImg = [[UIImage alloc] init];\n    nextImg = [_PhotoArray objectAtIndex:i];\n    UIView *newView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(100,100, 100, 100)];\n    UIImageView *nextIV = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(100,100, 100, 100)];\n    [nextIV setImage:nextImg];\n    [newView addSubview:nextIV];\n\n    self.view = newView;\n}\nelse\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"gesture went left\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It shows the next image on the pan, but then there is no PanGestureRecongizer on the new View that is loaded in. I thought that when I added the PANGesture in Storyboard, it would make it available to all views in the ViewController.</p>\n\n<p>This may be a separate question, but how do I get the animation to work on the PanGesture? I was incorrectly (obviously) under the impression that a Pan would do the slide in effect.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your help!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","ipad","uicollectionview"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":198,"score":2,"question_id":13017257,"title":"how do you determine spacing between cells in UICollectionView flowLayout","body":"<p>I have a UICollectionView with a flow layout and each cell is a square.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you

This does not seem to be what all these other alarms are doing as they do not keep on running if you press home BTN.

(Which is what I need)</p>\n\n<p>Also, When you ask how much time you have left running you get aprox 10 min. By dropping an infinite loop in there the numbers will actually run down to 0 and then go into the negatives for hours on end.(tested) Im not sure how this would behave in the real world or in terms of app acceptance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>B. Use a silent audio loop to pose as a continus audio playing media center</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Worked when locked, and will keep up running in most situations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can fail if interrupted by another media center and in some other occasions.</li>\n<li>Can also go agains apple policy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This can work I a lot of situations but is by far not ideal.

Loomis's suggestion that I change <code>#define U_HAVE_GCC_ATOMICS</code> from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> (in <code>platform.h</code>) made no difference, alas. I also realized that the last line of the error (<code>not found for architecture arm6</code>) didn't mean it would work for <code>arm7</code>, it was only an fyi that this was a cross-compile. When I specified an <code>arm7</code> build, it failed with the same messages. Alas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #4</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Success!</h1>\n\n<p>Summary: @sergio's build flags were essentially correct. I added -DU_HAVE_GCC_ATOMICS=0 to the ios build's CFLAGS.

Suppose one has to deal with only two views. Let's call them AP, AL, BP, BL, where the second letter stands for orientation. We start with a navigation controller with AP inside. To go between AP and BP we just push/pop. To go from AP to AL we present a modal navigation controller with AL inside. To go between AL and BL we push/pop inside the <em>second</em> navigation controller. Now to go from BP to BL we pop w/o animation and present a modal navigation controller with BL sitting on top of AL. To go from BL to BP we dismiss the modal navigation controller and push BP w/o animation.</p>\n\n<p>Seems to be a bit ugly, but not so bad.

But I also would like to use setFrame in my subclass, to make my life a litle easier.</p>\n\n<p>So summed up my question is:  Can I use autolayout and also adjust the frame of a UIView programmaitcally?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":0,"question_id":13246227,"title":"how i can add UIActivityIndicator on UITableView","body":"<p>i want to attech <code>UIActivityIndicator</code> with <code>UITableView</code> when  then first time table load on iphone activity must start blinking and when the table compleletely load in iphone when i click on load more cell then also i want to show activity blink for that moment when more rows loading kindly tell me how can i do that this is the code if you complete this code by your self then thanks in advance</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"RootViewController.h\"\n#import \"Tweet.h\"\n\n\n@implementation RootViewController\n\n@synthesize customImage,pagecontrol,cell;//indexPath;\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark View lifecycle\n\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad \n{\n    pageSize = 2;\n\n       // totalpages =(NSInteger) (xmlParser.tweets)/5 ;\n    xmlParser = [[XMLParser alloc] loadXMLByURL:@\"http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/KentFranks.xml\"];\n\n\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    self.title = @\"Tweets\";\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark Table view data source\n\n\n- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView \n{\n    return 1;\n}\n\n\n\n- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section \n{\n    if([xmlParser.tweets count]&gt;pageSize)\n    {\n        return pageSize+1;\n    }\n    return  xmlParser.tweets.count;\n    }\n\n\n\n- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath \n{\n\n    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @\"Cell\";\n\n    cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];\n    if (cell == nil) {\n        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];\n\n    }\n\n\n    //UIImage    *twitterLogo = [[UIImage imageNamed:@\"twitter-logo.png\"]autorelease];\n\n    NSString *imagepath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"twitter-logo\" ofType:@\"png\"];\n\n    UIImage *image =[[ UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:imagepath];\n    cell.imageView.image = image;\n\n\n\n    cell.detailTextLabel.text= @\"Add Subtitle here\";\n\n    Tweet *currentTweet = [[xmlParser tweets] objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];\n    if(indexPath.row&lt;pageSize)\n\n    {\n        cell.textLabel.text = currentTweet.content;\n    }\n\n    else\n    {\n\n\ncell.textLabel.text = @\"Load more \";\n}\n\n\n        NSLog(@\"cell: %@\",cell);\n    cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;\n    return cell;\n\n\n}\n\n-(IBAction)loadmorebutton:(id)sender;\n{\n\n    NSIndexPath *currentPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];\n    NSIndexPath *nextPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:currentPath.row+1 inSection:currentPath.section];\n    [self.tableView selectRowAtIndexPath:nextPath animated:YES scrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionMiddle];\n}\n\n\n- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath  *)indexPath{\n\n\n    if (indexPath.row==pageSize) \n    {\n        pageSize=pageSize+2;\n        [tableView reloadData];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n/*\n -(IBAction)pagecontrol:(UIPageControl *)pageControl\n {\n    [self.tableView reloadData];\n}\n -(IBAction)Pageindexchanges:(id)sender\n{\n    NSLog(@\"clicked page index: %i \",pagecontrol.currentPage);\n\n}\n*/\n- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\n{\n    return 55;\n}\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark Table view delegate\n\n/*- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath \n{\n\n}\n*/\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark Memory management\n\n- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning \n{\n\n    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];\n\n}\n\n- (void)viewDidUnload \n{\n\n}\n\n\n- (void)dealloc \n{\n    [xmlParser release];\n    [super dealloc];\n}\n\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ipad","ios6","xcode4.5"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":2,"question_id":13246625,"title":"How to change brightness of an Video or Image using UISlider on run time(Camera) in iPhone?","body":"<p>-(IBAction)changeslidervalue:(id)sender{</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSUserDefaults *defaults2 = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

A final working solution has NOT been provided yet so please do not close this question until we've accepted an answer or found and provided our own 100% working solution. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>==================================================================\n<br/>\nUsing Xcode 4.5.1, we have a tab-bar app with 5 tabs in it.  Each tab contains a UINavigationController, so the entire App thus needs to be viewed in Portrait mode. There is one exception: an \"image-gallery\" type view controller that we need to open and be viewed full-screen, and in LANDSCAPE mode.  </p>\n\n<p>We were able to do this easily in iOS5 using the following code in that one particular ViewController:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation\n{\n   return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But <code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation</code> has been deprecated in iOS6 and doesn't work any more. \n<br/>\nSo, to get this to work in iOS6, we've taken the following steps so far:<br/>\n1) created a subclass of the UITabBarController (which is our rootViewController)<br/>\n2) set its <code>supportedInterfaceOrientations</code> and <code>preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation</code> to <code>UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait</code>   (But note that we are NOT implementing the <code>shouldAutorotate</code> method in it)<br/>\n3) Set the PROJECT/Target supported orientations to ALL\n<br/><br/>\nThis ALMOST works perfectly: our \"Image Gallery\" ViewController does respond to both landscape modes - as it should - but it still initially opens in Portrait - which is bad. We need it to open up right in Landscape - and not ever be able to be displayed in Portrait. Right now it still doing both. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Any idea why its doing that - or how to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","cocoa-touch","interface-builder"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":738,"score":1,"question_id":4431881,"title":"How to access IBOutlets declared in superclass?","body":"<p>Hey all; I'm currently refactoring a couple of view controllers that share a few <code>IBOutlet</code>s and <code>IBAction</code> methods.

This gesture triggers a method that pops the current view from the navigation controller's stack, hence allowing the user to navigate back to the list of articles using this gesture.

I have a iPhone App that I have been updating for over a year and it has been working just fine on my iPad2, iPhone 3GS, as well as the 4G, 4GS, and 5. However, just recently I obtained an iPad3 to test the App on. Something very strange happens: When the App is loaded through Xcode in development it comes up and looks perfect - however, <strong>it won't respond to any touches at all</strong>. I have an alert that pops up on load and you can close that, but the actual main view controller will not react to any drag or touch gestures - it is essentially frozen. However! <strong>When I rotate the device and the App rotates correctly, it suddenly starts working just fine,</strong> even if I rotate it back! The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal. Here is what I have been able to confirm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad3 device: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-retina sim: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-normal sim: <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n<li>iPad2 device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-retina sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-normal sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4S device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4 device: normal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If all the iPhones worked and the iPads didn't, it would make some sense. But my ipad2 works just fine. Also, if I use the iPad3 open it, it is frozen. BUT! <strong>If I hit the 2X button, it starts working</strong> again even without rotation.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to test and see if it would work as a Universal App. On the iPad3 <strong>when I switch it over to Universal, it works just fine to begin with</strong>.

FYI... I have tried approaches 1 and 2, but I am not satisfied with the outcome from programming (and partly UX also) perspective(s).</p>\n\n<p>I have a table which has 2 sections. Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField.

Simple!</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been considering three approaches.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Include a <code>UIButton</code> object with each cell. The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach.

I have a paging scroll view that loads its content on demand. As a new page is scrolled to, another is loaded two pages to the right.

The scroll feels like it pauses very briefly at the 50% pint and then jumps back into action.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that there is no network component to my application, so the bottle neck is not while data is fetched - it is all in the loading of the new view.</p>\n\n<p>As I work on improving this, I need to benchmark the transition so I can evaluate the effect of my enhancements.

When the dialogue is released with a photo chosen this function runs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary  *)info {\nNSURL *mediaUrl;\n\nmediaUrl = (NSURL *)[info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL];\n\nif (mediaUrl == nil)\n{\n    imagePuzzle = (UIImage *) [info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage];\n    if(imagePuzzle == nil)\n    {\n        //--- Original Image was selected ---\n        imagePuzzle = (UIImage *) [info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];\n    }\n    else {\n        //--- Get the edited image ---\n        //--- If it was successful the above valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage\n        //--- would have assigned it already.\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    //--- Muppet selected a video\n}\n\n// Animate the picker window going away\n[picker dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\nImageViewController *imageViewController = [[ImageViewController alloc] init];\nimageViewController.delegate = self;    \n[self presentModalViewController:imageViewController animated:YES];\n[imageViewController release];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is where my problem lies.  I've tried many different hacks and iterations but the above code is the simplest to present the problem.  When the imageViewController is displayed as a modal dialogue the following exception is thrown:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2010-07-09 15:29:29.667 Golovomka[15183:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught\nexception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Attempting to begin a modal\ntransition from &lt;NewViewController: 0x5915f80&gt; to &lt;ImageViewController: 0x594a350&gt;     \nwhile a transition is already in progress. Wait for viewDidAppear/viewDidDisappear\nto know the current transition has completed'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I cure this?  I have tried delays and other tricks but do not really understand how I'm supposed to use viewDidAppear or viewDidDisappear to help me.  Also of note is that a very basic application with one view loading the picker then displaying another view with the image in does not produce the error.

The user can drag and rotate the image views via touch.  I'm having trouble moving the image view after it has been rotated.</p>\n\n<p>To rotate an image view, I apply a transform rotation, which works fine.  It looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CGAffineTransform trans = self.transform;\nself.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(trans, delta);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem comes later when the user tries to move the element via touch.  In touchesBegan:WithEvent:, I save the start point in a class variable, startLocation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{   \n    // Retrieve the touch point\n    CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\n    startLocation = pt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In touchesMoved:withEvent:, I had the following code, which works well enough if there is no rotation transform on the image view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{\n    CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\n    CGFloat dx = pt.x - startLocation.x;\n    CGFloat dy = pt.y - startLocation.y;\n    CGPoint newCenter = CGPointMake(self.center.x + dx, self.center.y + dy);\n    self.center = newCenter;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if there is a rotation transform on the image view, then the image view thrashes about the screen on each touchesMoved event and soon disappears.  In the debugger, I observed that the value of pt became monstrous.  It occurred to me that I needed to transform that point, which I did, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{\nCGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\nif (!CGAffineTransformIsIdentity(self.transform)) {\n    pt = CGPointApplyAffineTransform(pt, self.transform);\n}\n\nCGFloat dx = pt.x - startLocation.x;\nCGFloat dy = pt.y - startLocation.y;\nCGPoint newCenter = CGPointMake(self.center.x + dx, self.center.y + dy);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This worked much better.
