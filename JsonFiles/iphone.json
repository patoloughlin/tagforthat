Everything works perfectly well when run on the device. However, when I run my code on the simulator, I find that the transparent border of the image slowly turns black with each call to this function. The strange thing is that even if I don't modify the image data, the transparent border still begins to turn black with each call to this function. For example, I see the same problem even if my image manipulation code calls <code>CGBitmapContextGetData</code> but doesn't use the returned data pointer. To make the problem go away on the simulator, I have to comment out the call to <code>CGBitmapContextGetData</code> (and the freeing of the data pointer of course). Example code that still modifies the image on the simulator:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+ (UIImage *) updateImage:(UIImage *)inputImage\n{\n    UIImage *updatedImage;\n\n    /* Update colors in image appropriately */\n    CGImageRef image = [inputImage CGImage];\n\n    CGContextRef cgctx = [ColorHandler CreateARGBBitmapContext:image];\n    if (cgctx == NULL)\n    {\n        // error creating context\n        NSLog(@\"Error creating context.\\n\");\n        return nil;\n    }\n\n    size_t w = CGImageGetWidth(image);\n    size_t h = CGImageGetHeight(image);\n    CGRect rect = {{0,0},{w,h}};\n\n    // Draw the image to the bitmap context. Once we draw, the memory\n    // allocated for the context for rendering will then contain the\n    // raw image data in the specified color space.\n    CGContextDrawImage(cgctx, rect, image);\n\n    // Now we can get a pointer to the image data associated with the bitmap\n    // context.\n    void *data = CGBitmapContextGetData(cgctx);\n\n    CGImageRef ref = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(cgctx);\n    updatedImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:ref];\n    // When finished, release the context\n    CGContextRelease(cgctx);\n    CGImageRelease(ref);\n\n    // Free image data memory for the context\n    if (data)\n    {\n        free(data);\n    }\n\n    return updatedImage;    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I read <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2469659/iphone-images-on-the-simulator-and-the-actual-device-different-bitsperpixel-va\">the comments and answers here</a> regarding how images are managed differently between the device and simulator, but it hasn't helped me figure out my problem.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference between my <code>CreateARGBBitmapContext</code> and the example one is that I call <code>CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB</code> instead of <code>CGColorSpaceCreateWithName</code> because I am targeting iOS.

Even now I get an empty body and the Restkit log says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-11-06 19:28:03.231 MyProject OAuth[22205:11603] I\n  restkit.network:RKRequest.m:689 Status Code: 404</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not know where I am going wrong or what else to try! Looking forward for help in resolving this issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nI implemented a missing callback method and now am getting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The request must be signed\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>message. I presume that the above setup should have been enough for OAuth authentication, as mentioned in the referred link, what else am I supposed to do?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Observations</em>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I could see the internals of RestKit code and the OAuth parameters are put into the HTTP header field of the URL request. But am not sure if Drupal 7 is capable of reading this information from the HTTP header field for it always returns me back:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The request must be signed</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means that the OAuth parameters are not received by Drupal in first case, otherwise it would have given me the following error at least:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Invalid Signature</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was looking for some other options to see if my consumer key and secret and all the other setup is done properly in the server side or not. To confirm this I downloaded the php OAuth client script from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/oauth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Download the SVN code from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/oauth/source/checkout\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In that when I cross check the requests with PHP client, my requests are all being served perfectly &amp; I get back the xml by just entering the endpoint, consumer key and consumer secret.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing I tried is to allow GCOAuth to generate the signature and all inside the Restkit and placed a breakpoint so that I can dump the HTTP header fields in a log and instead of Restkit sending the request to the server, I quickly prepared the URL request exactly in the same format as the above PHP client does. Now this request when triggered, I get back the</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Invalid Signature</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>response, does this also somehow mean that the OAuth parameters are not properly prepared in Restkit / GCOAuth?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nRaj</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":13278458,"title":"How do I set the next text field in focus for editing when the user hits return?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1347779/how-to-navigate-through-textfields-next-done-buttons\">How to navigate through textfields (Next / Done Buttons)</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9540500/ios-app-next-key-wont-go-to-the-next-text-field\">iOS app “next” key won’t go to the next text field</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two text fields in my view and I'd like the cursor to move from the email text field to the password text field when the user hits the return key.

There are no image files in the app at all (yet). I've been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and I'm looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.</p>\n\n<h1>Game Setup</h1>\n\n<p>At a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game (towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc) are also subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.</p>\n\n<p>I keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each object's state is updated in the main game loop (fired by an <code>NSTimer</code> at 60-240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting). The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.</p>\n\n<p>I handle view updates using a <code>CADisplayLink</code> timer at the native refresh rate (60 Hz), which calls <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override <code>drawRect:</code> to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapon's new state.</p>\n\n<h1>Performance Issues</h1>\n\n<p>Testing on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS (the target frame rate), usually into the 10-20 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Using Instruments I've determined that only roughly 5% of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state -- the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the <code>CGContextDrawPath</code> function (which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done) is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.</p>\n\n<p>From some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isn't up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive (especially when drawing things that aren't opaque and have some alpha value &lt; 1.0). I'm almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but it's pretty low level and I'm not really excited to have to use it -- it doesn't seem like it should be necessary for what I'm doing here.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphics?</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>Some Ideas...</h2>\n\n<p>Someone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single <code>CALayer</code> instead of having each object on its own <code>CALayer</code>, but I'm not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a theory that using <code>CGAffineTransforms</code> to do my animation (i.e. draw the object's shape(s) in <code>drawRect:</code> once, then do transforms to move/rotate/resize its layer in subsequent frames) would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I don't think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>To give you a feel for the level of drawing I'm doing, here's an example of the <code>drawRect:</code> implementation for one of my weapon objects (a \"beam\" fired from a tower).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: this beam can be \"retargeted\" and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n\n    // Draw beam\n    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(c, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor);\n    CGContextSetLineWidth(c, self.width);\n    CGContextMoveToPoint(c, self.origin.x, self.origin.y);\n    CGPoint vector = [TDBoard vectorFromPoint:self.origin toPoint:self.destination];\n    double magnitude = sqrt(pow(self.board.frame.size.width, 2) + pow(self.board.frame.size.height, 2));\n    CGContextAddLineToPoint(c, self.origin.x+magnitude*vector.x, self.origin.y+magnitude*vector.y);\n    CGContextStrokePath(c);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Instruments Run</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a while:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The <code>TDGreenBeam</code> class has the exact <code>drawRect:</code> implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2b1y3512341d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full Size Screenshot</a></strong>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSw3j.png\" alt=\"Instruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":12290915,"title":"Works on simulator, but doesn't work on Iphone","body":"<p>I developed an application that runs fine on the Simulator, but crashes on the iPhone.\nActually, the app doesn't crash on initialization, but when I change to another view.\nI realized, the application just crash when i change to a view that doesn't have a Segue.

My question is not necessarily what is the best, but what is the best for an experienced iPhone developer but not not experienced in game design.  This will also be a solo project plus a graphics designer.  Consider I will be working full-time at my day job and will  need to support a number of other iPhone apps.  In other words, designing the game will be very much a part-time project but needs to go out in 2 - 4 months(?).  Ramp up time needs to be quick. I'd like to build 2D in the beginning and then go to 3D.</p>\n\n<p>I lean toward Unity 3D since it has lots of documentation and help.  From what I can see, the iPhone basic version is $399 and you get the IDE for free.  Can anyone confirm?</p>\n\n<p>Unity3D is for 3D but I've read you can still do 2D.  I'm trying to find out what is involved there.  One drawback with Unity3D is the 8-15 second Unity splash screen. I've also read this doesn't get much better with the higher priced version. But I suppose that is the price you pay for the convenience of having a simpler framework available.</p>\n\n<p>Cocos2d is a great framework and free but lacks documentation. It also requires much ramp up time to learn its framework and choose a suitable physics engine.  I don't see this route as practical.  I can see learning it across a long timeline as a side project but then you eat into getting your game out the door fairly quick.  If I go with Unity, I probably abandon Cocos2d altogether since I will have invested so much into Unity.</p>\n\n<p>Does my reasoning for Unity sound feasible?</p>\n\n<p>---EDIT---</p>\n\n<p>Based on some of the comments, here is the type of game I'm referring to initially: A 2D shooter similar to Zomebieville but most likely without its large feature set.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","backlight","uiscreen"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13275705,"title":"Dim iPhone back light on upside down","body":"<p>I have seen on an iOS application 'Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock' that when the iPhone is facing screen down (towards the floor) they have managed to dim the back light of the screen.

When you select that thumbnail and pull that image's asset using ALAsset, I get the full resolution version.\n  I did some research and couldn't find anything that helps in getting a second coordinate system of where the cropping happens.</p>\n\n<p>To test it, you need iOS5 to edit the image in your library. Select an image in your image library, select \"Edit\", and crop the image. When you get the ALAsset you'll get the full image, and if you sync using iPhoto, iPhoto also pulls the full image.

I can take pictures, add effects and so on, every time the camera is opened it works correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the exact steps to reproduce the issue:</p>\n\n<p>1) I open the app, everything works fine.</p>\n\n<p>2) The app enters the background either by pressing the home button or incoming call.</p>\n\n<p>3) When the app enters the foreground / reopened and the camera is accessed the shutter screen is shown and remains closed in the stuck position.</p>\n\n<p>4) The only way to fix it is to dismiss the modal view camera controller and press the camera button again.</p>\n\n<p>I have done some research to find an answer and have come up with nothing. There are no memory leaks and I have checked the memory allocations in instruments and there is nothing unusual.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone has a solution, I appreciate the help.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","keyboard","ios6"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13263616,"title":"Keyboard hides as dialog dissappears","body":"<p>In my application i am using sharekit inorder to post on Facebook.On main screen i have a textview and a custom keyboard.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you

This does not seem to be what all these other alarms are doing as they do not keep on running if you press home BTN.

(Which is what I need)</p>\n\n<p>Also, When you ask how much time you have left running you get aprox 10 min. By dropping an infinite loop in there the numbers will actually run down to 0 and then go into the negatives for hours on end.(tested) Im not sure how this would behave in the real world or in terms of app acceptance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>B. Use a silent audio loop to pose as a continus audio playing media center</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Worked when locked, and will keep up running in most situations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can fail if interrupted by another media center and in some other occasions.</li>\n<li>Can also go agains apple policy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This can work I a lot of situations but is by far not ideal.

Suppose one has to deal with only two views. Let's call them AP, AL, BP, BL, where the second letter stands for orientation. We start with a navigation controller with AP inside. To go between AP and BP we just push/pop. To go from AP to AL we present a modal navigation controller with AL inside. To go between AL and BL we push/pop inside the <em>second</em> navigation controller. Now to go from BP to BL we pop w/o animation and present a modal navigation controller with BL sitting on top of AL.

A final working solution has NOT been provided yet so please do not close this question until we've accepted an answer or found and provided our own 100% working solution. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>==================================================================\n<br/>\nUsing Xcode 4.5.1, we have a tab-bar app with 5 tabs in it.  Each tab contains a UINavigationController, so the entire App thus needs to be viewed in Portrait mode. There is one exception: an \"image-gallery\" type view controller that we need to open and be viewed full-screen, and in LANDSCAPE mode.  </p>\n\n<p>We were able to do this easily in iOS5 using the following code in that one particular ViewController:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation\n{\n   return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But <code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation</code> has been deprecated in iOS6 and doesn't work any more. \n<br/>\nSo, to get this to work in iOS6, we've taken the following steps so far:<br/>\n1) created a subclass of the UITabBarController (which is our rootViewController)<br/>\n2) set its <code>supportedInterfaceOrientations</code> and <code>preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation</code> to <code>UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait</code>   (But note that we are NOT implementing the <code>shouldAutorotate</code> method in it)<br/>\n3) Set the PROJECT/Target supported orientations to ALL\n<br/><br/>\nThis ALMOST works perfectly: our \"Image Gallery\" ViewController does respond to both landscape modes - as it should - but it still initially opens in Portrait - which is bad. We need it to open up right in Landscape - and not ever be able to be displayed in Portrait. Right now it still doing both. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Any idea why its doing that - or how to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","cocoa-touch","interface-builder"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":739,"score":1,"question_id":4431881,"title":"How to access IBOutlets declared in superclass?","body":"<p>Hey all; I'm currently refactoring a couple of view controllers that share a few <code>IBOutlet</code>s and <code>IBAction</code> methods.

This gesture triggers a method that pops the current view from the navigation controller's stack, hence allowing the user to navigate back to the list of articles using this gesture.

The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal. Here is what I have been able to confirm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad3 device: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-retina sim: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-normal sim: <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n<li>iPad2 device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-retina sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-normal sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4S device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4 device: normal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If all the iPhones worked and the iPads didn't, it would make some sense. But my ipad2 works just fine. Also, if I use the iPad3 open it, it is frozen. BUT! <strong>If I hit the 2X button, it starts working</strong> again even without rotation.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to test and see if it would work as a Universal App. On the iPad3 <strong>when I switch it over to Universal, it works just fine to begin with</strong>. So something weird must be going on with the simulator. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n\n<p>-Mark</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","uiwebview","subclassing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13234010,"title":"How to replace method of UIWebView instead restricted subclassing?","body":"<p>Subclassing of UIWebView is restricted by Apple.

FYI... I have tried approaches 1 and 2, but I am not satisfied with the outcome from programming (and partly UX also) perspective(s).</p>\n\n<p>I have a table which has 2 sections. Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField. When the user presses <code>Edit</code> button (located on the <code>navigationBar</code>), the user can change the position of the cells, i.e. - s/he can move the cells from one section to another. Simple!</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been considering three approaches.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Include a <code>UIButton</code> object with each cell. The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach. Even worse, I will have to keep a track of the index where the cell should appear when it translates from one section to another.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have 8 cells in section 1 and 2. 4 cells of second section appear as hidden in the first section and vice versa. When the user presses + in one section A, its property should be set to hidden in section A and it should be made visible in section B. However, when the cell's property is set to hidden, a void is created in its place which looks very ugly. Is there a way to fill the void? Also, if I use a grouped cells, the remaining cell at the end of section will not have rounded bottom corners.</p></li>\n<li><p>User can drag cells from one section to another.

I have a paging scroll view that loads its content on demand. As a new page is scrolled to, another is loaded two pages to the right. This happens when the current page is scrolled 50% of screen, and on slower devices the loading is enough of a bottle neck that it interrupts the smoothness of the scroll. The scroll feels like it pauses very briefly at the 50% pint and then jumps back into action.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that there is no network component to my application, so the bottle neck is not while data is fetched - it is all in the loading of the new view.</p>\n\n<p>As I work on improving this, I need to benchmark the transition so I can evaluate the effect of my enhancements.

The user can drag and rotate the image views via touch.  I'm having trouble moving the image view after it has been rotated.</p>\n\n<p>To rotate an image view, I apply a transform rotation, which works fine.  It looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CGAffineTransform trans = self.transform;\nself.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(trans, delta);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem comes later when the user tries to move the element via touch.  In touchesBegan:WithEvent:, I save the start point in a class variable, startLocation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{   \n    // Retrieve the touch point\n    CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\n    startLocation = pt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In touchesMoved:withEvent:, I had the following code, which works well enough if there is no rotation transform on the image view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{\n    CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\n    CGFloat dx = pt.x - startLocation.x;\n    CGFloat dy = pt.y - startLocation.y;\n    CGPoint newCenter = CGPointMake(self.center.x + dx, self.center.y + dy);\n    self.center = newCenter;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if there is a rotation transform on the image view, then the image view thrashes about the screen on each touchesMoved event and soon disappears.  In the debugger, I observed that the value of pt became monstrous.  It occurred to me that I needed to transform that point, which I did, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event\n{\nCGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self];\nif (!CGAffineTransformIsIdentity(self.transform)) {\n    pt = CGPointApplyAffineTransform(pt, self.transform);\n}\n\nCGFloat dx = pt.x - startLocation.x;\nCGFloat dy = pt.y - startLocation.y;\nCGPoint newCenter = CGPointMake(self.center.x + dx, self.center.y + dy);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This worked much better.  I can drag the image about the screen now.  But the very first movement causes the image to jolt once in one direction or another, depending on the angle of rotation in the transform and the dimensions of the image view.</p>\n\n<p>How can I move the image view without having the initial jolt?</p>\n\n<p>Why is it that I do not need to transform startLocation (the point I capture when touches began)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","libjpeg"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13213359,"title":"How to use jpeglib in xCode","body":"<p>I'm developing an iPhone application and I'm kind of new to everything.

What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>Also, as I understand it, if that line enables reusable cells, why do I have to with a collection view vs not having to in a table view?</p>\n\n<p>Any technical or explanatory help appreciated,\nthanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","interface-builder","xcode4"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4963,"score":2,"question_id":5464010,"title":"'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '-[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] loaded the GameView nib but the view outlet was not set","body":"<p>This is not the same situation as the multitude of other similar questions here. </p>\n\n<p><em><strong></em>* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '-[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] loaded the GameView nib but the view outlet was not set.'</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might be thinking \"do as it says, connect the File's Owner to the View in IB!\".

The override reliably picks up name changes made in the cloud, e.g. renaming the document on another device. Then <em>sometimes</em> newURL is the final expected URL for the renamed document, i.e. something sensible from which I can extract the new name use `lastPathComponent', update my interface etc. On other occasions newURL is a document in some other directory with a last path component beginning 'purg-', e.g. purg-012fdcfbe3b3bbce6e603fdfd2f000b2cb28649e95.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) presentedItemDidMoveToURL:(NSURL *) newURL;\n{   \n    [super presentedItemDidMoveToURL: newURL];\n\n    if ([(id)[self delegate] respondsToSelector:@selector(documentNameChanged:)])\n    {\n        [[self delegate] documentNameChanged: self];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The <code>presentedItemDidMoveToURL:</code> method does not seem to be the root cause of the problem. For example, if I don't override that method at all, but periodically check in the viewController that is looking after the open document, then <em>sometimes</em> after a rename <code>fileURL</code> will return the new name and <em>sometimes</em> it will return `purg-.....'. So the issue appears to be to do with how renaming is handled.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>As al_lea pointed out, the issue here was related to <code>accommodatePresentedItemDeletionWithCompletionHandler:</code>.

I want the first three views restricted to portrait orientation and only the last view should be allowed to rotate to landscape. When returning from the fourth view to the third and the fourth view was in landscape orientation I want everything to rotate back to portrait.</p>\n\n<p>In iOS 5 I simply defined <code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:</code> in each of my view controllers to return YES for the allowable orientations. Everything worked as described above, including the return to portrait even if the device was being held in landscape orientation when returning from view controller #4 to #3.</p>\n\n<p>In iOS 6 all view controllers rotate to landscape, breaking those that weren't meant to. The iOS 6 release notes say </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More responsibility is moving to the app and the app delegate. Now, iOS containers (such as <code>UINavigationController</code>) do not consult their children to determine whether they should autorotate. [...] The system asks the top-most full-screen view controller (typically the root view controller) for its supported interface orientations whenever the device rotates or whenever a view controller is presented with the full-screen modal presentation style. Moreover, the supported orientations are retrieved only if this view controller returns YES from its <code>shouldAutorotate</code> method. [...] The system determines whether an orientation is supported by intersecting the value returned by the app’s <code>supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:</code> method with the value returned by the <code>supportedInterfaceOrientations</code> method of the top-most full-screen controller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I subclassed <code>UINavigationController</code>, gave my <code>MainNavigationController</code> a boolean property <code>landscapeOK</code> and used this to return the allowable orientations in <code>supportedInterfaceOrientations</code>. Then in each of my view controllers' <code>viewWillAppear:</code> methods I have a line like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [(MainNavigationController*)[self navigationController] setLandscapeOK:YES];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to tell my <code>MainNavigationController</code> the desired behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here comes the question:</strong> If I now navigate to my fourth view in portrait mode and turn the phone over it rotates to landscape. Now I press the back button to return to my third view which is supposed to work portrait only. But it doesn't rotate back. How do I make it do that?</p>\n\n<p>I tried</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation:UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in the <code>viewWillAppear</code> method of my third view controller, but it doesn't do anything. Is this the wrong method to call or maybe the wrong place to call it or should I be implementing the whole thing in a totally different way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","pinterest"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2715,"score":7,"question_id":9909511,"title":"iOS application integration with pinterest","body":"<p>Pinterest API is not public yet and only suggested way to share is their web button.\nWhat is the most <strong>reliable</strong> way currently to allow pinterest sharing from iOS app?</p>\n"}]}

I have an iPhone application ready to receive live streaming using the <code>MPMoviePlayerController</code> class.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my requirements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have a live .FLV streaming feed URL for some news video channels. I want to pass this to some server software to encode to an iPhone-supported format to stream to my iPhone program.</p>\n\n<p>I used VLC to stream to the iPhone, but it doesn't work. I used nightly build version 1.2 of VLC that they advertise has iPhone streaming, but it still doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>I tried using VLC to Wowza and then to iPhone. It somehow worked after encoding via VLC and segmentation and streaming via Wowza to iPhone, but the trial version only supports up to 3 minutes streaming, so it is useless for giving a demo to my customer.<br>\n<br><em>or</em></p></li>\n<li><p>I bought a TV Tuner card and I have the analog cable connection network. I want to input this cable connection into the TV Tuner card and then use some software like VLC to stream the channel's feed to the iPhone for most of the channels I get.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I mainly want to stream through either method above to iPhone, Android, and Blackberry devices. As Blackberry and Android support RTSP streaming I don't have much difficulty - I can simply use VLC itself to stream it for all channels at a time. The big headache, however, occurs for iPhone's http streaming.</p>\n\n<p>What server software is available for streaming to iPhone, Android and Blackberry? What software can I buy for my business purposes that would solve either point 1 or point 2? </p>\n\n<p>Could someone please guide me to the right software which can solve my problem: to resolve streaming to iPhone? I am ready to buy the server software. Please note, I have the iPhone and Android application program already able to receive and play the streaming video.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","iphone","ios"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13190780,"title":"Migrating app from Android to iPhone","body":"<p>I have an app deployed in Android, I wish to create the same app for iOS also.

This is the intended behavior.  </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're on element 1 of the pickerView.  If you scroll to element 0 (by dragging the component downwards)...and go past it (dragging the 0 element far down the picker view beyond the blue selection box)...when you let go, the pickerView will scroll back to element 0 in order to center it back in the blue selection box, and then call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we take the same example...(ie you're on element 1 of the pickerView, and scroll far beyond element 0)...if the pickerView is in the middle of scrolling back to element 0, and you quickly click element 0 or the white space above it, then the pickerView will awkwardly \"jump\" from wherever it is in the scroll animation straight to element 0, and then WON'T call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big issue, as we are now on element 0 without actually calling didSelectRow...thus, we have no indication that we are no longer on element 1.
