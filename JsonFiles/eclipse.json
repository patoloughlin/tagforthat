The user must be able to input their age and select their gender and select their resting heart rate.\nThe program must then use this formula to determine your target heart rate:</p>\n\n<p>Target Heart Rate = [(Maximum Heart Rate – Resting Heart Rate) × 80%]</p>\n\n<p>The program must be able to display the use’s maximum heart Rate, resting heart rate and Target Heart Rate.</p>\n\n<p>but for some reason im receiving when i run my program it does not seem to fully take in the inputs and gives me a wrong answer when the button is clicked for male it gives me the answer of 179.0 for male and 169.0 for female.</p>\n\n<p>ive looked over and over it and cannot seem to figure out this logical error. here is my code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainHMR extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {\n\nButton chkCmd;\nCheckBox Male, Femail;\nEditText age, RestHeart;\nTextView MaxHeart, TargetHeart;\n\nint m = 220;\nint f = 212;\nint AgeResult =0, RestResultFinal =0, TargetHeartFinal =0;\ndouble MaleResult, FemailResult;\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main_hmr);\n    Initilise();\n    format();\n    Male.setOnClickListener(this);\n    Femail.setOnClickListener(this);\n    chkCmd.setOnClickListener(this);\n\n}\n\nprivate void Initilise() {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    /* Button */chkCmd = (Button) findViewById(R.id.bResults);\n    /* checkBox */Male = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cbM);\n    /* checkBox */Femail = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cbF);\n    /* EditText */age = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.etAge);\n    /* EditText */RestHeart = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.etRestHeart);\n    /* TextView */TargetHeart = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.etTargetHeard);\n}\n\nprivate void format() {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n\n    String change = age.getText().toString();\n    AgeResult = 0; // set it to 0 as the default\n    try {\n        AgeResult = Integer.parseInt(change);\n        System.out.println(AgeResult);\n    }\n    catch (NumberFormatException e){}\n\n    String changeTwo = RestHeart.getText().toString();\n    RestResultFinal = 0; // set it to 0 as the default\n    try {\n        RestResultFinal = Integer.parseInt(changeTwo);\n        System.out.println(RestResultFinal);\n    }\n    catch (NumberFormatException e){}\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onClick(View v) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n\n    switch(v.getId()){\n    case R.id.bResults:\n    if (Male.isChecked()) {\n        int result = m - AgeResult;\n        MaleResult = ((result - RestResultFinal) * 0.8);\n        String finalResult = Double.toString(MaleResult);\n        TargetHeart.setText(finalResult);\n    } else if (Femail.isChecked()) {\n        int result = f - AgeResult;\n        FemailResult = (int) ((result - RestResultFinal) * 0.8);\n        String finalResult = Double.toString(FemailResult);\n        TargetHeart.setText(finalResult);\n        break;\n    }\n\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","eclipse","video","android-intent"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":1,"question_id":13269007,"title":"Eclipse Video Intent video","body":"<p>I'm quite new to this, I have checked for an answer at the forums here but I didn't find any answer that can really help me out.

When I was initially investigating this I came to the conclusion that the shared user id only applied to different projects, not different packages.</p>\n\n<p>Also I don't believe there was any interaction with the database when I stripped everything down. The fact that the 3rd activity could be any activity, even HomeActivity, was something against this theory.</p>\n\n<h3>Useful links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9039017/android-app-application-cannot-be-instantiated-due-to-nullpointerexception\">stackoverflow: android.app.Application cannot be instantiated due to NullPointerException</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.0.1_r1/android/app/LoadedApk.java?av=f\">GreoCode android.app.LoadedApk on 4.0.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg194903.html\">Possible race condition?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=25869&amp;can=1&amp;q=LoadedApk.makeApplication&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars\">Android issue #25869</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Update 1/11/2012</h3>\n\n<p>Last couple of days I've jumped back into this project, I created a brand new project in Eclipse Juno (was on Helios before) and transferred everything over manually so that Eclipse and Android tools handled almost all of the Manifest interaction but it's still occurring.

When this happens I am rebuilding rows in a table layout that include a spinner, an edittext, and another spinner. When the fragment finishes loading, all of the rows contain the information from the last row prior to the orientation change. For example:</p>\n\n<p>b4 orientation change:</p>\n\n<p>a      b      c</p>\n\n<p>d      e      f</p>\n\n<p>g      h      i</p>\n\n<p>after orientation change:</p>\n\n<p>g      h      i</p>\n\n<p>g      h      i</p>\n\n<p>g      h      i</p>\n\n<p>From tracking the views in the debug tool when I rotate the screen I have found that the values are passed correctly and that the values are set in the new rows correctly in the onActivityCreated method.

My understanding of the fragment lifcycle is that there are no other methods that are called after on Resume, so I am very perplexed.</p>\n\n<p>What is going wrong?

If you export your plug-in,\n  place it in the “dropins” folder of your Eclipse installation and your\n  styling is available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I proceeded to the <a href=\"http://www.vogella.com/articles/Eclipse4CSS/article.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">actual article</a> , but here the fact that I never done any plugin development for eclipse got me a bit confused about certain aspects of this article. </p>\n\n<p>I created a new plugin, with a activator. Now the first bit that gets me stuck is in the parts about extension points. He skips the bit about setting up the product and the appname property, I guesses it needed to be something like the following for me</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;    \n  &lt;extension\n     point=\"org.eclipse.core.runtime.products\"&gt;\n  &lt;product\n        application=\"mythemetest.Activator\"\n        name=\"mythemetest\"&gt;\n     &lt;property\n           name=\"appName\"\n           value=\"mythemetest\"&gt;\n     &lt;/property&gt;\n     &lt;property\n           name=\"applicationCSS\"\n           value=\"platform:/plugin/mythemetest/css/default.css \"&gt;\n     &lt;/property&gt;\n  &lt;/product&gt;    \n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p> \n     </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Running this application will not start up a new eclipse themed using the default.css, so im doing something wrong.

project (Right click on project -> Properties -> Deployment Assembly) I see the jars included in my project but aren't the lastest jars that included through project's pom.xml...For I to solve this I had to include the jars manually...</p>\n\n<p>I will always do this?</p>\n\n<p>PD: I leave my files .classpath and .project </p>\n\n<p><strong>.classpath</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml

(entries in some tables)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","eclipse","led","flashlight"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13194975,"title":"Make Strobe Light from LED light on button click","body":"<p>i have made a flashlight app and i want to try to make add-on to allow a strobe light feature. </p>\n\n<p>I want to set it up on a different button thought, not the same one. i think i need to use a timer , but i have never used a timer because im new to java.</p>\n\n<p>here is my code for the flashlight:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class FlashLightActivity extends Activity {\n\n\nprivate boolean isLighOn = false;\nprivate Camera camera;\nprivate Button button;\n\n@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    if (camera != null) {\n        camera.release();\n    }\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.main);\n    button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.buttonFlashlight);\n    Context context = this;\n    PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();\n\n    if (!pm.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_CAMERA)) {\n        Log.e(\"err\", \"Device has no camera!\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    camera = Camera.open();\n    final Parameters p = camera.getParameters();\n\n    button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n        public void onClick(View arg0) {\n\n            if (isLighOn) {\n                Log.i(\"info\", \"torch is turn off!\");\n                p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_OFF);\n                camera.setParameters(p);\n                camera.stopPreview();\n                isLighOn = false;\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"info\", \"torch is turn on!\");\n                p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);\n                camera.setParameters(p);\n                camera.startPreview();\n                isLighOn = true;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    }\n }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","debugging","variables"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13186644,"title":"Can't see variables when debugging Java code in Eclipse","body":"<p>I have very annoying problem:</p>\n\n<p>When debugging</p>\n\n<pre><code>String tm1 = \"1\";\nString tm2 = \"\";\ntm1 = tm2; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only variable tm2 is showing in Variables view in debugger mode, but not tm1.\nI assume because I used tm2 value in 3rd line.

I am able to run this and successfully add accounts and records to the database by doing the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(in the data directory) java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server\n\nant build hosted\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the build.xml file used to build this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?&gt;\n&lt;project name=\"Guestbook\" default=\"build\" basedir=\".\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Define gwt.home, gwt.dev.jar, appengine.sdk.home --&gt;\n  &lt;property file=\"build.properties\"/&gt;\n\n  &lt;path id=\"project.class.path\"&gt;\n    &lt;pathelement location=\"war/WEB-INF/classes\"/&gt;\n    &lt;pathelement location=\"${gwt.home}/gwt-user.jar\"/&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Add any additional non-server libs (such as JUnit) --&gt;\n    &lt;fileset dir=\"war/WEB-INF/lib\"&gt;\n      &lt;include name=\"**/*.jar\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/fileset&gt;\n  &lt;/path&gt;\n\n  &lt;target name=\"libs\" description=\"Copy libs to WEB-INF/lib\"&gt;\n    &lt;mkdir dir=\"war/WEB-INF/lib\" /&gt;\n    &lt;copy todir=\"war/WEB-INF/lib\" file=\"${gwt.home}/gwt-servlet.jar\" /&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Add any additional server libs that need to be copied --&gt;\n    &lt;copy todir=\"war/WEB-INF/lib\" flatten=\"true\"&gt;\n      &lt;fileset dir=\"lib/\"&gt;\n        &lt;include name=\"**/*.jar\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/fileset&gt;\n    &lt;/copy&gt;\n  &lt;/target&gt;\n\n  &lt;target name=\"javac\" depends=\"libs\" description=\"Compile java source\"&gt;\n    &lt;mkdir dir=\"war/WEB-INF/classes\"/&gt;\n    &lt;javac srcdir=\"src\" includes=\"**\" encoding=\"utf-8\"\n        destdir=\"war/WEB-INF/classes\"\n        source=\"1.5\" target=\"1.5\" nowarn=\"true\"\n        debug=\"true\" debuglevel=\"lines,vars,source\"&gt;\n      &lt;classpath refid=\"project.class.path\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/javac&gt;\n  &lt;/target&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- can add additional arguments like -logLevel INFO or -style PRETTY --&gt;\n  &lt;target name=\"gwtc\" depends=\"javac\" description=\"GWT compile to JavaScript\"&gt;\n    &lt;java failonerror=\"true\" fork=\"true\" classname=\"com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler\"&gt;\n      &lt;classpath&gt;\n        &lt;pathelement location=\"src\"/&gt;\n        &lt;path refid=\"project.class.path\"/&gt;\n        &lt;pathelement location=\"${gwt.home}/${gwt.dev.jar}\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/classpath&gt;\n      &lt;!-- add jvmarg -Xss16M or similar if you see a StackOverflowError --&gt;\n      &lt;jvmarg value=\"-Xmx256M\"/&gt;\n      &lt;arg value=\"com.google.musicstore.MusicStore\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/java&gt;\n  &lt;/target&gt;\n\n  &lt;target name=\"hosted\" depends=\"javac\" description=\"Run hosted mode\"&gt;\n    &lt;java failonerror=\"true\" fork=\"true\" classname=\"com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode\"&gt;\n      &lt;classpath&gt;\n        &lt;pathelement location=\"src\"/&gt;\n        &lt;path refid=\"project.class.path\"/&gt;\n        &lt;pathelement location=\"${gwt.home}/${gwt.dev.jar}\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/classpath&gt;\n      &lt;jvmarg value=\"-Xmx256M\"/&gt;\n      &lt;arg value=\"-startupUrl\"/&gt;\n      &lt;arg value=\"MusicStore.html\"/&gt;\n      &lt;arg value=\"com.google.musicstore.MusicStore\"/&gt;\n      &lt;!-- Additional arguments like -style PRETTY or -logLevel DEBUG --&gt;\n    &lt;/java&gt;\n  &lt;/target&gt;\n\n  &lt;target name=\"build\" depends=\"gwtc\" description=\"Build this project\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;target name=\"clean\" description=\"Cleans this project\"&gt;\n    &lt;delete dir=\"war/WEB-INF/classes\" failonerror=\"false\" /&gt;\n    &lt;delete dir=\"war/musicstore\" failonerror=\"false\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/target&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now I would like to get this simple example working in eclipse. I created a project called MusicStore using the gwt eclipse plugin. I then copied over the tutorial files without changing them. I can't post an image but here is a link to my eclipse project structure:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://oi50.tinypic.com/t6rn2w.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi50.tinypic.com/t6rn2w.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Again, I start by running</p>\n\n<pre><code>(in the data directory) java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I try to run my project in eclipse but hibernate doesn't work. When I try to add an account in the UI it alerts \"Failed to save account\" and I get the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/hibernate/Session.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know how I should go about getting the sample code working with eclipse. I think that many users new to hibernate will also want to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","windows","eclipse","java-ee"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":89,"score":0,"question_id":11189013,"title":"Eclipse shutdown after start error due to wrong username or password","body":"<p>I am getting error <strong>Wrong username or password</strong> when I try to start Eclipse.

to test the UI of an Eclipse Juno RCP","body":"<p>We're developing an Eclipse-based RCP. Recently we've updated to Eclipse Juno and currently we focus on quality, which of course brought automated tests into focus, since the application is quite big and the testing effort delays releases.</p>\n\n<p>We're already writing JUnit tests, but I'm more interested in UI tests. With older Eclipses this would not be a problem. There are plenty of good test frameworks around. Unfortunately with Juno everything changed due to the added ability to switch out the default SWT UI by Swing or JavaFX (at least this is what I've understood about the changes causing problems)</p>\n\n<p>So most of the test tools don't work properly anymore. From past experiences it seems that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SWTBot</strong> seems to get not much love lately and is very unstable (can't find elements in certain versions)</li>\n<li><strong>Window Tester</strong> seems quite good, but has a lot of problems identifying an element during the test run (especially with pop-ups such as content assist or tool tips)</li>\n<li>Apparently <strong>Froglogics Squish</strong> supports Juno, but since a license costs about 2,5k Euro I have to pass</li>\n<li>The same seems to be the case for <strong>QF-Test</strong> (too expensive).</li>\n<li>This leaves <strong>Jubula</strong> (or GUIDancer, which is the commercial Jubula), which we've tried in the past, but which had similar problems as Window Tester and SWTBot (unstable in terms of changes to the Eclipse platform and difficulties to detect some elements)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I need to know, which tool to focus on / trust in.

Or does anybody know how Eclipse tests their own platform (if they even do it atm)?</p>\n\n<p>Searching for information related to \"test\", \"Juno\" and \"UI/GUI\" only brings up the commercial products.</p>\n\n<p>For me it is important, to find a tool, where I can use the developed test cased even in future releases, which means: A framework project, which has some support of the community to be able to adapt quickly.

If yes, is there a way I can turn off assist/correction for template-based containers specifically?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I now also tried disabling c++11 support, and if I do that the problem disappears -- but then of course the c++ 11 types and syntax aren't recognized.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>I imported a second project, entered exactly the same settings, and for this project the parsing works. The only difference is the project layout (different location of makefiles). But even if I delete and re-import the first project, it still doesn't work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","ant","junit"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2616,"score":9,"question_id":10536095,"title":"ant junit build error inside eclipse","body":"<p>I am hoping there are some people who have seen and have a solution for the problem that I am having right now with ant script.

3.3, <strong>no</strong> m2eclipse plugin, Java 1.6, Tomcat 5.5.</p>\n\n<p>My application is a web application that have some other projects as dependencies, as well as some third-parties dependencies.\nMy project is managed by Maven, and everything works fine when we build the application using this tool.</p>\n\n<p>To work on my project using Eclipse, I run <code>mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse</code> and then, I import my projects in the IDE.</p>\n\n<p>My problem occurs when I want to deploy this web application on a Tomcat 5.5 server (this server is managed by Eclipse).\nWhen I create a new Tomcat server, and deploy my <em>my-project-portal</em> application in it, it only adds the <em>my-project-xxx</em> dependencies, as well as few third-parties dependencies (about 9 of the hundreds defined).\nOn one of my colleagues desktop (he is using Eclipse 3.5), no third-parties dependency are deployed at all, just the <em>my-project-xxx</em> JAR...</p>\n\n<p>However, when I look at the web-app project properties, in <em>Java Build Path > Libraries</em>, or in \"Deployment Assembly\", the list of dependencies is correct and complete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n\n<p>I did some tests with an older Eclipse (3.3, with WTP 3.1) and I do not encounter any deployment issue.\nHowever, this WTP was still using the \"Java EE Modules Dependencies\", which is not the case of the latest WTP version.</p>\n\n<p>Until now, we used a custom Maven plugin after the <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code> that copies all the dependencies (including transitives ones) into <code>my-webapp-project/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib</code>.\nDoing that, Eclipse automatically deployed the content of these dependencies, and thus, we got all the dependencies in the Tomcat server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is wrong with my process?</li>\n<li>Do I really need to copy all the dependencies in the

Our team uses Perforce as a means of source control for this project. To do so we use the P4Eclipse Plugin.</p>\n\n<p>The issue I am having is when I add new Builders to a project. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tinypic.com/r/a0c5u/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image of my Builder</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tinypic.com/r/al3nkg/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Builder Settings</a></p>\n\n<p>The Builder works fine locally, but after I submit that change to Perforce, anyone who syncs up gets an error. If they open the Builder settings for the project, the Builder I added has been replaced with an error message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Invalid external Tool</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have submitted both the .project file and the .launch file. Clearly there is something more I need to submit.</p>\n\n<p>Digging a little deeper, I found that on the other users machine, the .launch file I committed to Perforce had actually been deleted by Eclipse! Just opening the workspace containing the project causes it to delete that file. I believe that is the cause of the \"Invalid external Tool\" error; not that the tool is corrupt or something, but that it doesn't even exist.</p>\n\n<p>Testing things further, I had the user manually create a new Builder with the exact same name locally. They then closed Eclipse, and revert all the changes they made. So at this point, there local project matches exactly what they had before. But now when they open up Eclipse the Builder I commit loads fine!</p>\n\n<p>This implies that there is some local setting that tells Eclipse \"don't delete the .launch; it is needed\" and by simply creating one locally (even reverting that change after) that message is set.</p>\n\n<p>So my ultimate question is: what files need to be under source control in order to share a project's Builder settings?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I did another test:</p>\n\n<p>This time i made a copy of my project directory and the workspace directory, then created a new Builder.

An XML file describes a window with components placed in different containers and event listeners are attached to them. The type of the UI denotes which kind of data it can accept and how it's saved back to the database. I know it's not a good design but it's a legacy system, we cannot change the whole architecture from one day to an another :)</p>\n\n<p>I like to use DSL to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>improve readability</li>\n<li>provide code completion in IDEs (current XMLs doesn't have any schema definitions)</li>\n<li>optionally include event listener code in the UI definition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Currently it looks something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Form type=\"BIBLIOGRAPHY\" name=\"BOOK\" maximizable=\"false\" minimizable=\"true\"&gt;\n  &lt;Size width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /&gt;\n  &lt;Tab name=\"FIRST_PAGE\"&gt;\n    &lt;Control type=\"INPUT.FIELD\" name=\"SOME_FIELD\" value=\"database_column\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/Tab&gt;\n&lt;/Form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and i like to replace it with something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>form(type=FormType.BIBLIOGRAPHY, name=FormName.BOOK, maximizable=false, minimizable=true) {\n  size = { width = 320, height = 240 }\n  tab(name=\"FIRST_PAGE\") {\n    input(name=\"SOME_FIELD\", value=\"database_column\")\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've thought about <a href=\"http://groovy.dzone.com/news/groovy-dsl-scratch-2-hours\" rel=\"nofollow\">using Groovy as a DSL</a> which provides a good base for this with Closures and meta classes. However i've noticed that code completion requires DSLDs and using these are only supported in Eclipse and IntelliJ. Team members mostly work with NetBeans. Because of that XML with a correctly written XML Schema can support this better.</p>\n\n<p>I've also read about Java DSLs which in my case can be realized by combining the <a href=\"http://blog.jooq.org/2012/01/05/the-java-fluent-api-designer-crash-course/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fluent API interface</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow\">builder pattern</a>. The big advantage is that this results in Java code, so code completion, Javadocs, everything works out of the box in IDEs. I can use dynamic compilation by using Groovy which fully understands Java. However this introduces non-standard Java beans with setters foreign to Spring (and we've just finished replacing the project's spine with Spring so it's important to us). I don't know if we'll ever use these UI classes directly with Spring but i like to keep this option. Also Java DSLs look a little bit ugly and it can require a lot of hand written code to work.</p>\n\n<p>Is it a good practice to do something like that? Is there any other solution to do this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","eclipse","proguard"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":229,"score":1,"question_id":13040226,"title":"Progaurd returned with error code 1","body":"<p>Ok guys so this becoming extremely annoying trying to get my project to work when exporting/</p>\n\n<p>Progaurd keeps giving me this error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Proguard returned with error code 1.

I can put a breakpoint there, the program really breaks but I do not see the source code (which is open in the next child window :-( ... ), I only see the class file editor of the correct file and java pseudoassembler code. There is a button \"Change attached source...\" which looks potential but problem is that this button sometimes does not work.

There will be just a short progress dialog and no change.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that sometimes \"Change attached source...\" works, but in general if it fails, the second (3rd, 4th, ...) will always fail to so trying it more times does not help.

you have to make a change to the source or build scripts. So people change from Debug to Release, run the app, and are unknowingly actually linking to the Debug version still.</p>\n\n<p>So then we tried outputting the library to a unique Shared Object based on the build configuration. For example, the debug version is gamed.so. The release version is gamer.so. <strong>The problem is</strong>, the Java code has no concept of build configuration, so how do we know which version of the library to load (which is done from Java)?</p>\n\n<p>Well to get around that we do a try/catch looping through all the possible versions of the library attempting to load them. When we find the one that exists, load it! <strong>Problem being</strong> that the old versions of the library do not get removed when deploying a new configuration to the phone. So if you have built and run both Debug and Release, both of those libraries are now on the phone! Which ever one you ask for first, it will find and load.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, this seems like something that <strong>must</strong> have been solved already, but I have found very little information online.

I am using AndroXplorer to access the internal storage. </p>\n\n<p>As I've never worked with Android Apps before, could anybody give me some ideas how I can figure out why the App is running on ALL the virtual devices but not on real ones?</p>\n\n<p>Thx in advance!</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n    // Create new file\n    File newxmlfile = new File(this.getFilesDir(), \"newcontacts3.xml\");\n    try {\n        newxmlfile.createNewFile();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        Log.e(\"IOException\", \"Exception in create new File(\");\n    }\n    FileOutputStream fileos = null;\n    try {\n        fileos = new FileOutputStream(newxmlfile);\n\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        Log.e(\"FileNotFoundException\", e.toString());\n    }\n    XmlSerializer serializer = Xml.newSerializer();\n    try {\n        serializer.setOutput(fileos, \"UTF-8\");\n        serializer.startDocument(null, Boolean.valueOf(true));\n        serializer.setFeature(\n                \"http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#indent-output\",\n                true);\n        serializer.startTag(null, \"root\");\n\n        ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();\n        Cursor cursor = cr.query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI,\n                null, null, null, null);\n        if (cursor.getCount() &gt; 0) {\n            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {\n\n                String id = cursor.getString(cursor\n                        .getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.Contacts._ID));\n\n                serializer.startTag(null, \"ContactID\");\n                serializer.attribute(null, \"ID\", id);\n\n                // GET ALL THE CONTACT DATA AND WRITE IT IN THE FILE\n\n                serializer.endTag(null, \"ContactID\");\n            }\n        }\n        cursor.close();\n\n        serializer.endTag(null, \"root\");\n        serializer.endDocument();\n        serializer.flush();\n        fileos.close();\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        Log.e(\"Exception\", \"Exception occured in wroting\");\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {\n    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>My minSDKVersion is 8, the target Version is 15. \nAnd I've added the permission for the internet and the permission to read contacts.</p>\n\n<p>When I run it on the virtual devices, the application starts, my start screen appears and it creates the file \"newcontacs3.xml\" und data/data/com.examples.anotherproject/files. </p>\n"},{"tags":["eclipse","junit","rcp","logback"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":12606043,"title":"RCP JUnitPluginTest, logback and slf4","body":"<p>I've created a RCP plugin inside which I've used logback with slf4 that are part of eclipse platform.</p>\n\n<p>I've also created a plugin test that I'm launching by <em>Run As->Junit Plugin Test</em> (see the picture below).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mVdUV.jpg\" alt=\"Run As\"></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunatelly I'm getting this error</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\".\n  SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation\n  SLF4J: See <a href=\"http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder</a> for further details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to be a classpath error but I don't really know why; Can anyone help me?</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","eclipse","sdk"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7623,"score":1,"question_id":6361349,"title":"Android Problem: Eclipse cannot find ADB.exe","body":"<p>First, I know this problem has been asked before, namely : <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4659014/could-not-find-adb-exe-on-my-tools-folder\">Could not find adb.exe on my tools folder</a></p>\n\n<p>but I tried every answer given and none work (even the accepted answer).</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I updated the Android SDK and now Eclipse cannot find adb.exe.

The developers (me included) want more robust testing of current legacy code BEFORE attempting to move the code into a Spring framework so that we can prove along the way that the behavior is still correct. </p>\n\n<p><b>JBoss 4.2</b> – Version limitation by vendor software (<b>Adobe LiveCycle ES2</b>); Our Java web application uses this setup of JBoss to run and makes use of the Adobe LiveCycle API.</p>\n\n<p><i>We have been unable to successfully run the vendor configured JBoss within Eclipse</i> – we have spent weeks attempting this, including contacting the company that provides our support for the configuration of JBoss for Adobe LiveCycle.  Supposedly the problem is a memory limitation issue with settings in Eclipse, but changing the memory settings has thus far failed in a successful JBoss server start within Eclipse.  For now, attempting to get JBoss to run inside of Eclipse is on hold.</p>\n\n<p>The database connection is defined in a JNDI data source that JBoss loads on start up.  Both our web application and Adobe LiveCycle need to create connections to this data source.</p>\n\n<h2>Code</h2>\n\n<p>I am glossing over error checking and class structure in this code snippet to focus on the heart of the matter.  Hopefully that does not cause problems for others.  Text in square brackets is not actual text.</p>\n\n<p>Our code to create the connection is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Properties props = new Properties();\nFileInputStream in = null;\nin = new FileInputStream(System.getProperty(\"[Properties File Alias]\"));\nprops.load(in);\nString dsName = props.getProperty(“[JNDI data source name here]”); \nInitialContext jndiCntx = new InitialContext();\nDataSource ds = (DataSource) jndiCntx.lookup(dsName);\nDs.getConnection();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to be able to test methods dependent upon this code without making any changes to it.</p>\n\n<p>Reference to properties file alias in properties-service.xml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;!-- ==================================================================== --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- System Properties Service                                            --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ==================================================================== --&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Allows rich access to system properties.--&gt;\n\n&lt;mbean code=\"org.jboss.varia.property.SystemPropertiesService\" \n name=\"jboss:type=Service,name=SystemProperties\"&gt;\n  &lt;attribute name=\"Properties\"&gt;\n    [Folder Alias]=[filepath1]\n    [Properties File Alias]=[filepath2]\n  &lt;/attribute&gt;\n&lt;/mbean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Snippet from properties file located at filepath2</p>\n\n<pre><code>[JNDI data source name]=java:/[JNDI data source name]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The JNDI xml file for this data source is set up like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;datasources&gt;\n  &lt;local-tx-datasource&gt;\n    &lt;jndi-name&gt;[JNDI data source name here]&lt;/jndi-name&gt;\n    &lt;connection-url&gt;jdbc:teradata://[url]/database=[database name]&lt;/connection-url&gt;\n    &lt;driver-class&gt;com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver&lt;/driver-class&gt;\n    &lt;user-name&gt;[user name]&lt;/user-name&gt;\n    &lt;password&gt;[password]&lt;/password&gt;\n    &lt;!-- sql to call on an existing pooled connection when it is obtained from pool --&gt;\n    &lt;check-valid-connection-sql&gt;SELECT 1+1&lt;/check-valid-connection-sql&gt;\n  &lt;/local-tx-datasource&gt;\n&lt;/datasources&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>My thoughts of where the solution may be</h2>\n\n<p>Is there something I can do in a @BeforeClass method in order to make the properties the above code is looking for available without JBoss?  Maybe somehow using the setProperty method of the java.util.Properties class?  I would also like to use the same JNDI xml file that JBoss reads from, if possible, in order to reduce duplicate configuration settings.  </p>\n\n<p>So far all of my research ends with the advice “Use Spring”, but I don’t think we’re ready to open that can of worms yet. I am not an expert in JBoss, but if more details of our JBoss setup are needed for a helpful answer, I will do my best to get them, though I will likely need some pointers on where to look.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stackoverflow Research references:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9696195/jndi-lookup-in-junit-using-spring\">Jndi lookup in junit using spring</a> <br/>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1615417/out-of-container-jndi-data-source\">Out of container JNDI data source</a> <br/>\n<strong>Other research references:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html</a> <br/>\n<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/basics/prepare/initial.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/basics/prepare/initial.html</a> <br/></p>\n"},{"tags":["eclipse","pydev"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":106,"score":2,"question_id":13039194,"title":"Unable to gather python interpreter info for pydev","body":"<p>OS: Windows 7 x64</p>\n\n<p>Python: 2.7.3</p>\n\n<p>Pydev: 2.7.1.2012100913</p>\n\n<p>Eclipse: Version: Juno Service Release 1  Build id: 20121004-1855</p>\n\n<p>I am unable to configure a python interpreter in Pydev.

I am using Eclipse with the Sequoyah plugin. Everything is set up and works well.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have run into an issue with build configurations. You can manage build configurations by right-clicking the project->properties and then go to the C/C++ Build section. This allows you to create the traditional Debug, and Release builds that most C++ libraries depend on in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of my \"Debug\" configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>V=1 NDK_DEBUG=1 NDK_APPLICATION_MK=config/debug/Application.mk\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These work well, except that when I switch back and forth between configurations, it does not trigger a rebuild of the libraries I am building. This would be expected for something like Visual Studio where each build config dumps to a different directory, but in Eclipse everything gets dumped to the same directory. I am forced to actually change relevant source files to trigger a rebuild. So what ends up happening is I end up running (for instance) in the Debug configuration but linking to libraries that were built in Release.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: <strong>is there a way to force the NDK to rebuild a library when changing configurations?</strong> I am aware of the -B command I can add, but that rebuilds <em>everything</em>, <em>everytime</em>.

I have been using NetBeans for a long time, but recently made the switch to Eclipse for a few reasons I won't get into. Anyway, I find the javascript source formatting behavior to be very odd.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example block of javascript code that I formatted myself:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function buildDatabase () {\n    db.transaction(function (tx) {\n        tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS calendar');\n        tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS calendar(id UNIQUE, summary, description, location, startdate, enddate)');\n    }, function (err) {\n        document.querySelector('#debugLog').innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;' + err.message + '&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>very simple stuff. Now, if I hit ctrl-shift-f to format it (because frankly this feature is a massive time saver) for reasons I can't understand it will now look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function buildDatabase() {\n    db\n            .transaction(\n                    function(tx) {\n                        tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS calendar');\n                        tx\n                                .executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS calendar(id UNIQUE, summary, description, location, startdate, enddate)');\n                    },\n                    function(err) {\n                        document.querySelector('#debugLog').innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;'\n                                + err.message + '&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';\n                    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why does it want to move .transaction to a new line? It doesn't get anywhere near the line width of 80. It is really messy looking. It is doing the same with the second .executeSql as well, and it still doesn't wrap properly. It's just very odd.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course I am aware of <em>Window > Preferences > JavaScript > Code Style</em> but no matter what I seem to do in here fixes this. I am hoping someone has more experience with Eclipse to know what is going wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I have the Android Dev Tools installed and PDT.

As soon as I remove the dependency of ProjectA from ProjectB's pom file all the maven dependencies are found by eclipse.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- com.company.myproj:app:6.6.0:jar Missing: ---------- 1) com.company.myproj:main:pom:${myproj.version} ---------- 1 required artifact is missing. for artifact: com.company.myproj:main:pom:$\n {myproj.version} from the specified remote repositories: apache-incubating (http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-incubating-repository/, releases=true, snapshots=true), central (http://\n repo1.maven.org/maven2, releases=true, snapshots=false)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I still need ProjectB to have that dependency for ProjectA.

I'm trying to teach myself, and sometimes the solo route can be frustrating.  I'm working a problem in Liang's book Introduction to Java Programming 8th edition (Exercise 14.1) where I have to modify a GeometricObject class to implement Comparable and then define a static \"max\" method to find the larger of two GeometricObjects.  Then I have to write a test program that uses this max method to find the larger of two rectangles.  Previously in the book, the author has had us create a Rectangle subclass that extends GeometricObject.  I've modified the GeometricObject class to implement Comparable, and I've created the max method.  Then I've modified the Rectangle subclass to also implement Comparable.  I wrote the test program as well.  </p>\n\n<p>But Eclipse is giving me the Big Red X by my Rectangle class's declaration saying \"The interface Comparable cannot be implemented more than once with different arguments: Comparable and Comparable.\"  That's when my class declaration looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Rectangle extends GeometricObject implements Comparable&lt;Rectangle&gt; {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried removing the parameter altogether:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Rectangle extends GeometricObject implements Comparable {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and the error message changes to \"Comparable is a raw type. References to generic type Comparable should be parameterized.\"  Plus, it adds a second error in this case: \"The type Rectangle must implement the inherited abstract method Comparable.compareTo(Object)\"</p>\n\n<p>When I look at examples of this kind of declaration, they always seem to use the class name as the parameter for Comparable in the declaration, an in fact, that's what the books say to do.  So why is it saying I can't do that here?</p>\n\n<p>And then what about the second error regarding the compareTo() method?  Why is it only being pointed out when I remove the parameter from the declaration?

The Source tab of the repository in my BitBucket account shows all of the files that were contained in the original Subversion repository.

This folder contains no package folders and no Java source files. Eclipse documentation and forums say that these '>' signs are displayed when a file has been changed since it was last synchronized with a repository (although they mostly talk about these '>' signs being displayed for individual files, not for folders). I tried using the Eclipse command 'Team -> Synchronize Workspace' to make sure that the folders were synchronized, but it didn't change anything.

In order to get memory usage from Eclipse you have to \"Dump HPROF file\" from the DDMS prospective. Before doing that you have to choose in the DDMS preference panel, when it says \"HPROF Action\", the \"Save to disk\" action. So from now on when you dump HPROF file you'll be asked where you want to save your .hprof file. You have to convert this file with the Android tool \"hprof-conv\" you can find in your Android SDK installation under the directory \"./tools\".

The same thing happens with the forward delete key.</p>\n\n<p>I'm beginning to think this is an issue with Java, since I have the same feeling that everything is slightly \"behind me\" when I'm using -any- Java application.</p>\n\n<p>The computer is an intel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz Prescott, with 2GB's of DDR400 RAM and a Radeon HD3650 graphics card.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone knows how to fix this lagging issue, I'm all ears (eyes?); if anyone can recommend a different IDE with capabilities similar to Aptana (I do Python, HTML, CSS and JS; I use Git for SCM), I'd be glad to give it a try.

However I was stunned as it was still possible to post images....</p>\n\n<p>My Assumption now is that the hash key does not mean anything to facebook at all and that the app is actually bounds to the app-id that is first used when using the facebook connect.
