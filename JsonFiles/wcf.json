So far, the WCF service is a selfhosted service on the local pc.  It contains several interfaces (one per program functionallity).\nAs an improvement I want to expose the service to the internet, so I can call it using a new mobile app.  This can be easily done by configuring the router/firewall and use some kind of dynamic dns or remember the ip address (in worst case scenario).</p>\n\n<p>But now, here comes the real question:\nIn a next step I will distribute the winforms app to several locations (call it customers), acompagnied with their local WCF service en their mobile app.  In order to allow the customer to connect to their wcf service (using the mobile app), I can set up now a dynamic dns for each customer, but I don't want to do that.  First of all, the best dyndns services are not free, or you have to renew periodically.  Second, I want to offer the customers my own dns service so I can 'forward' their wcf call to their own local service.\nThe wcfdnsrouter should be located at a public webhost, where the customers ip address is provided with an ip-updater (as it is often the case for other dyndns services)</p>\n\n<p>As an example, imagine this:</p>\n\n<p>Customer A; IP1; endpoint: <a href=\"http://wcfdnsrouter.com/A\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wcfdnsrouter.com/A</a></p>\n\n<p>Customer B; IP2; endpoint: <a href=\"http://wcfdnsrouter.com/B\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wcfdnsrouter.com/B</a></p>\n\n<p>Where I want that \nwcfdnsrouter.com/<strong>A</strong> will forward (or route?) ALL calls to <strong>IP1</strong> \nand\nwcfdnsrouter.com/<strong>B</strong> will forward (or route?) ALL calls to <strong>IP2</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>With this scenario, the customer can access his service using mobile app from every place on earth.  Hardware configuration on customers site is not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to use a parameter, rather than having an other url per customer.  This should reduce the configuration and avoid duplicating my service.  However, it is still an open trace (in this case, I need to create a subdomain and copy the wcfdnsrouter that is nothing more than a ordinary routingservice).</p>\n\n<p>So, the entry point seems to be a restfull service that routes the message to another ip address\\service.\nI did already some research about routingservices, but I think I'll not get where I want.  Contentbased routing is not an option since I don't want to change all my interfaces to have a criteria.  I do not see how to make the link between the parameter in the restfull service with the ip addres I need to call (so another service).</p>\n\n<p>Security is not realy a issue at this moment.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that is question is NOT about (free) dns services.  The purpose is to create it myself.  Activating a new customer should not be more than installing the auto-ip-updater and assigning some kind of code (like A and B) in the example.</p>\n\n<p>I need some advice how to do that.  Maybe I'm on the wrong track thinking about routing?  Maybe there is a very easy way that I mis?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!  </p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net",".net","wcf","web-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13267630,"title":"Add reference to service within same project","body":"<p>I'm wondering if it is okay to add a reference to a web service within the same project (web application), i.e. I'm adding a reference in the same project where the service is defined.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for doing so is because  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hosting the service becomes easier (gets automatically hosted when hosting the web app).</li>\n<li>Invoking the service is done dynamically, i.e. the service url is fetched (from db) at run time and methods on that particular service are invoked.

Everything works fine on my local machine but when deployed I get an odd hang after the first call + 15 seconds that I can't figure out.</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought it was my Client as the Server's trace wasn't showing any faults. Then I found someone else's service with basicHttpBinding hosted online @ <a href=\"http://www.dimmiunapassword.com/wcf/PwdService.svc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dimmiunapassword.com/wcf/PwdService.svc</a> that works fine. I can make a request, wait 20 seconds, make another and its successful.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it may be a problem with something I am doing in my service then, so I created a new basic service that returns a modified string... it's actually the New Project Template with nothing changed. That way I knew it was nothing with my more complex service returning larger amounts of data (although it works fine on my localhost). Unfortunately I'm having the same issue. I can make the first call fine and subsequent calls within 15 seconds go through fine, but if I wait 20 seconds- the Client will Timeout on the 1 minute default mark.</p>\n\n<p>After the Client times out, I can recall the service and the call goes through fine but exhibits the same 15 second behavior. If I wait long enough after the first call, say 10 minutes, another call will go through fine as well, almost like a Timeout is being triggered on the server and then resets to work again. On the flip-side, if the Client times out at the 1 minute default, it's almost like that resets the server as well.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried closing the service after each call. I've tried wrapping the channel and closing/disposing. I've tried a Using statement to close. Nothing worked. I think I've tried nearly every configuration for Concurrency, Instancing, Throttling, Sessioning, Timeouts, and Size limits with no luck. I've also traced the client and server, the client shows a timeout fault and the server shows nothing but the last successful request. The only thing I can notice is the \"Thread ID\" in the Clients trace changes and every time, it fails throwing a Timeout fault @ 1 minute (default). I can request 10+ calls within 15 seconds of the first call and they all process on the same \"Thread ID\" in the trace... as soon as it hits 15 seconds, the Thread ID changes and that's when the Client just hangs until the Timeout.</p>\n\n<p>I am stumped.

If not, please let me know and I will add. I normally don't ask questions like this as I can usually debug myself but this has got me. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated! Thanks </p>\n\n<h1>Edit #1</h1>\n\n<p>I came across this url <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wenlong/archive/2010/02/11/why-does-wcf-become-slow-after-being-idle-for-15-seconds.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wenlong/archive/2010/02/11/why-does-wcf-become-slow-after-being-idle-for-15-seconds.aspx</a> which I believe may be the problem/work-around. It talks about WCF becoming slow after the threads idle for 15 seconds but in my case it flat times out. In the Trace Logs I noticed the Thread ID changing after 15 seconds and that sounds exactly like this Threadpool issue though. I'm going to give this a try and see if it works tonight or tomorrow. I'll report back.</p>\n\n<h1>Edit #2</h1>\n\n<p>Edit #1 did not help so to further test\\debug, I managed to host the same WCF Service on a different Server/Domain than Godaddy and the WCF Service worked as it should. No problems at all. \nI'm in the process of trying to solve this through Godaddy now, it really seems like something on their end. I'll update the thread with anything new once I find out.</p>\n\n<h1>Edit #3</h1>\n\n<p>After about 2 weeks of trying to debug myself and another week waiting for GoDaddy to understand what my problem was <em>(I finally directed them to this StackOverflow page)</em>, the WCF Service is finally working correctly. Turns out, it was something with GoDaddy's server. I'm not exactly sure what was causing the issue but they migrated me to another server and whala, works perfect. Hopefully this saves someone time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wcf","wcf-client","wcf-hosting"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1493,"score":1,"question_id":1959383,"title":"Hosting and Consuming WCF Service from Same Process","body":"<p>Can you become a client of a WCF Service from with the Process that is hosting the WCF Service?

These services should be able to handle thousands of transactions per day.</p>\n\n<p>I've played around with the routing in WCF 4 in lieu of the broker service concept I've mentioned, however, have not seen much value in it as it just simply does a redirect.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also trying to figure out how to optimize the proxies that the broker service (assuming this practice is advisable) has to the underlying services. Right now I simply have the proxies as private members within the brokers main class. Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private UnderlyingServiceClient _underlyingServiceClient = new UnderlyingServiceClient();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've considered caching the proxy, however, am concerned that if I run into a fault that the entire proxy at that point would be faulted and cannot be reused (unless I catch the fault and simply re-instantiate).</p>\n\n<p>My goal with these services is to ensure that the client consuming them can get \"in and out\" as quickly as possible. A quick request-reply.</p>\n\n<p>Any input/feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","asp.net-mvc-3","wcf","web-api"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"question_id":13254185,"title":"Web Api call not returning __type in JSON response","body":"<p>We have an MVC website that was calling through to WCF Restful services but we are now replacing them with Web Api calls.

When I put this information into the web.config of my service/client though, I still get the error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wcf","service","nettcpbinding","windowservice"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":13246828,"title":"wcf error \"Sequence contains no elements\" - \"Collection was Out Of fixed size\"","body":"<p>i am new in wcf. i start to create a wcf project that save people information in EF database.\ni had lots of error and fix them by searching in sites but recently i stoped by some error and cant fix them.</p>\n\n<p>my project is <strong>n-tier with Entity framework</strong> data model. there is 4 layer for server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DAL</strong>(Contain EF dataModel)--><strong>BLL</strong>(Class library for insert/update/Delete Functions)--><strong>Service Layer</strong>(wcf class library)--><strong>Host Layer</strong>(windows service)</p>\n\n<p>i host my service with Windows Service. and the service binding is nettcpbinding. i configure service true so no problem here.</p>\n\n<p>i have a Project with name \"Common\"(class library) that All 4 project access to it and as you know i create a code generator and pasted generated class to common.(Separate class model with DAL).</p>\n\n<p>now Client has just (Host Layer) service reference.in client, i have all entity classes in service class.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem Occure When I want to insert object to data base See Code below :</p>\n\n<p><strong>Server Side (This Is in BLL And Service Layer):</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace BLL\n{\n    public static class bz\n    {\n        public static class People\n        {\n            public static void myInsert(Common.People p, out bool Result)\n            {\n                Result = false;\n\n                Common.EFContainer cntx = new Common.EFContainer();\n                cntx.ContextOptions.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;\n                cntx.ContextOptions.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;\n\n                if (p.FirstName == \"\" || p.FirstName == null)\n                {\n                   throw new Exception(\"Fill Fist Name\") ;\n                }\n                //  ... more validate\n                //--&gt;I Do not use first or single etc in validating&lt;--\n                try\n                {\n\n                    cntx.Peoples.AddObject(p);\n                    cntx.SaveChanges();\n                    Result = true;\n                }\n                catch (Exception ex)\n                {\n                    throw ex;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        public static class Gender\n        {\n             public static List&lt;Common.Gender&gt; GetData()\n             {\n                Common.EFContainer cntx = new Common.EFContainer();\n                cntx.ContextOptions.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;\n                cntx.ContextOptions.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;\n\n                return cntx.Genders.ToList();\n             }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace ServiceLayer\n{\n\n[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required)]\npublic interface IService\n{\n    [FaultContract(typeof(NormalExeption))]\n    [OperationContract]\n    bool AddToPeople(Common.People p);\n\n    [OperationContract]\n    List&lt;Common.Gender&gt; GetGenders();\n}\n\n  [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.Single, ConcurrencyMode =     System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single)]\n public class myService : IService\n {\n    [OperationBehavior]\n    public bool AddToPeople(Common.People p)\n    {\n      try\n        {\n            BLL.bz.People.myInsert(p, out result);\n\n             return result;\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        { \n           var exep = new NormalExeption(ex.Message, ex.Source, 0, Icons.Error);\n           throw new FaultException&lt;NormalExeption&gt;(exep, new FaultReason(new FaultReasonText(ex.Message)));\n        }\n    }\n    [OperationBehavior]\n    public  List&lt;Common.Gender&gt; GetGenders()\n    {\n       return BLL.bz.Gender.GetData();\n    }\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client Sied :</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>ServiceRef.People p = new ServiceRef.People();\nServiceRef.myServiceClient client=new ServiceRef.myServiceClient();\n\np.FirstName=\"S\";\n\n//...

Calling the service is surprisingly slow compared to how much time the operation itself takes. The WCF trace log makes it look like more than two seconds are spent on impersonation (see the fifth line):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[15:32:3.193] From: Processing message 1.\n[15:32:3.193] Activity boundary.\n[15:32:3.193] Received a message over a channel.\n[15:32:3.194] ServiceChannel information.\n[15:32:5.539] Security Impersonation succeeded at the server.\n[15:32:5.540] To: Execute 'MyNamespace.GetFloorplan'.\n[15:32:5.540] Activity boundary.\n[15:32:6.302] From: Execute 'MyNamespace.GetFloorplan'.\n[15:32:6.302] Activity boundary.\n[15:32:6.305] Sent a message over a channel.\n[15:32:6.306] Activity boundary.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This baffles me, because I thought that impersonation was something you needed to explicitly enable in the configuration (or trigger from the code). I was just brought in on this project as a consultant, so I don't have a full overview of the entire source code yet, but the text \"impersonate\" or \"impersonation\" does not exist anywhere in the source code. Adding to the confusion, <code>System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity</code> from inside the service returns an unauthenticated identity with no name, and <code>System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name</code> returns <code>IIS APPPOOL\\MyCustomAppPool</code>, so the impersonation doesn't really seem to have accomplished anything.</p>\n\n<p>We use forms authentication and ASP.NET compatibility mode. When I disable the latter (which I'm not sure I can do permanently, because there might be functionality that depends on it that I don't know about yet), <code>Security Impersonation succeeded at the server</code> disappears from the log, but the time difference between <code>Received a message over a channel.</code> and <code>To: Execute 'MyNamespace.GetFloorplan'.</code> is still almost two seconds. Adding <code>[OperationBehavior(Impersonation = ImpersonationOption.NotAllowed)]</code> to the operation does not help.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone understand what is going on here?

So, how can I get a running status variable from a WCF service to an asp.net page?</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void Timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    if (statusMessage == null)\n    {\n        // feed operation finished or timer is running invalid\n        Timer1.Enabled = false;\n    }\n\n    try\n    {\n        UpdateStatusDisplay();\n    }\n    catch (Exception exp)\n    {\n        ....\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my WCF service</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string Status = \"\";\n\n    public void BeginImport(ImportOptions options)\n    {\n        _options = options;\n\n        string conString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"String1\"].ConnectionString;\n        using (var con = new SqlConnection(conString))\n        {\n            con.Open();\n\n            var products = con.Query(\"SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS\");\n\n            foreach (var product in products)\n            {\n                Status = \"Processing product \" + product.ProductName);\n            }\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    public string GetStatus()\n    {\n        return Status;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI just read about [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerSession)], is this all I'd need to do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","wcf","c#-4.0"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":13179164,"title":"bidirectional communication using wcf for messaging","body":"<p>I am creating a messaging module in our asp.net application by using WCF service.

Just as described <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1571183/808723\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1.exchange some form of a private/public key pair; the server generates a key pair and keeps the private key to itself and shares the public key with the client (e.g. over a WCF message, for instance)</p>\n  \n  <p>2.using that private/public key pair, exchange a common shared secret, e.g. an \"encryption key\" that will symmetrically encrypt your messages (and since it's symmetrical, the server can use the same key to decrypt the messages)</p>\n  \n  <p>3.setup infrastructure on your client (e.g. a WCF extension called a behavior) to inspect the message before it goes out and encrypt it with your shared secret</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That would be secure, wouldn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any existing solution to archive what I described? If not I'll create it on my own. Where do I start best?

The public part of this generated certificate will be dynamically included into the client setup. When running the client setup on the client machine the certificate will be installed into the trustet windows certificate store of the client.</p>\n\n<p>So there's no extra work when installing the product and everything should be secure, just as we want it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight","service","pollingduplexhttpbinding"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13180165,"title":"Silverlight PollingDuplex timeouts","body":"<p>I'm currently working on an application that implements a polling duplex service.

I checked both of these entries in my config file; in the exe as well as in the dll, and they match up PERFECTLY. I've had other people in the office double check behind me to make sure I wasn't going blind at one point, but of course they came to the same conclusion as me that everything looked like it was specified correctly.

Several applications want to read and write to this database so exposing a WCF service seemed like the best approach.</p>\n\n<p>I started off using the Entity Framework for ORM, CSLA for the Business Logic layer and a standard WCF service for communication with the client applications. All was going fine until I took a look at WCF Data Services and got seduced by the lovely REST interface, ease of consumption by AJAX clients and the joy of using new tech!</p>\n\n<p>I've now replaced large parts of the WCF services with a single WCF Data Service which exposes the Entity Framework model directly, bypassing the CSLA layer. This works great for read only operations but I cannot perform the other CRUD functions without some business logic.</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking into Interceptors and I can certainly put business login in there but I actually want to intercept the POST/Add operation, map the values onto the CSLA BusinessBase class in question and let that do all the validation and final save into the database.

The object are very complex, with lots of nested xsd's and different namespaces. Proxy classes are generated by adding a Web Reference to an original wsdl with 30+ webmethods and using xsd.exe for generating the missing SOAPFault objects. My pilot WCF Service consists of only 1 webmethod which matches the exact syntax of one of the original methods: 1 object as parameter, returning 1 other object as result value. I greated a WCF Interface using those proxy classes, using attributes: XMLSerializerFormat and ServiceContract on the interface, OperationContract on one method from original wsdl specifying Action, ReplyAction, all with the proper namespaces. I create incoming client messages using SoapUI; I generated a project from the original WSDL files (causing the SoapUI project to have 30+ methods) and created one new Request at the one implemented WebMethod, changed the url to my wcf webservice and send the message. Because of the specified (Reply-)Action in the OperationContractAttribute, the message is actually received and properly deserialized into an object. To get this far (40 hours of googling), a lot of frustration led me to using a custom endpoint in which the WCF 'wrapped tags' are removed, the namespaces for nested types are corrected, and the generated wsdl get's flattened (for better compatibility with other tools then MS VisualStudio).</p>\n\n<p>Interface code is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[XmlSerializerFormat(Use = OperationFormatUse.Literal, Style = OperationFormatStyle.Document, SupportFaults = true)]\n[ServiceContract(Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN)]\npublic interface IOntvangAsynchroon\n{\n\n    [OperationContract(Action = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN + \"/zakLk01\", ReplyAction = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN + \"/zakLk01\", Name = \"zakLk01\")]\n    [FaultContract(typeof(Fo03Bericht), Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStuf)]\n    Bv03Bericht zakLk01([XmlElement(\"zakLk01\", Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN)] ZAKLk01 zakLk011);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I use a Webclient in code to send a message, everything works. My problem is, when I use a WCF client. I use ChannelFactory&lt; IOntvangAsynchroon > to send a message. But the generated xml looks different: it includes the parametername of the method! It took me a lot of time to figure this one out, but here's what happens:</p>\n\n<p>Correct xml (stripped soap envelope):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;soap:Body&gt;\n&lt;zakLk01 xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/sector/zkn/0310\"&gt;\n&lt;stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;berichtcode xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;Bv01&lt;/berichtcode&gt;\n&lt;zender xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;\n&lt;applicatie&gt;ONBEKEND&lt;/applicatie&gt;\n&lt;/zender&gt;\n&lt;/stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;parameters&gt;\n&lt;/parameters&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk01&gt;\n&lt;/soap:Body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Bad xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;soap:Body&gt;\n&lt;zakLk01 xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/sector/zkn/0310\"&gt;\n&lt;zakLk011&gt;\n&lt;stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;berichtcode xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;Bv01&lt;/berichtcode&gt;\n&lt;zender xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;\n&lt;applicatie&gt;ONBEKEND&lt;/applicatie&gt;\n&lt;/zender&gt;\n&lt;/stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;parameters&gt;\n&lt;/parameters&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk011&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk01&gt;\n&lt;/soap:Body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the 'zakLk011' element? It is the name of the parameter of the method in my interface! So NOW it is zakLk011, but it when my parameter name was 'zakLk01', the xml seemed to contain some magical duplicate of the tag above, but without namespace. Of course, you can imagine me going crazy over what was happening before finding out it was the parametername!</p>\n\n<p>I now have actually created a WCF Service, at which I cannot send messages using a WCF Client anymore. For clarity: The method does get invoked using the WCF Client on my webservice, but the parameter object is empty. Because I'm using a custom endpoint to log the incoming xml, I can see the message is received fine, but just with the wrong syntax!</p>\n\n<p>WCF client code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZAKLk01 stufbericht = MessageFactory.CreateZAKLk01();\nChannelFactory&lt;IOntvangAsynchroon&gt; factory = new ChannelFactory&lt;IOntvangAsynchroon&gt;(new BasicHttpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(\"http://localhost:8193/Roxit/Link/zkn0310\"));\nfactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new LinkEndpointBehavior());\nIOntvangAsynchroon client = factory.CreateChannel();\nclient.zakLk01(stufbericht);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not using a generated client, i just reference the webservice (share libraries) like I am used to.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: When generating a Service Reference, it generates duplicate classes(dont know why..). When these duplicates are removed however, a client sends messages with correct xml. But my architecture requires shared libraries, so this doesn't help me out.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone please help me? I can't google anything on this...</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wcf","certificates","self-signed"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":781,"score":0,"question_id":3229558,"title":"WCF Transport security with peertrust and self-signed client certificates","body":"<p>I'm been struggling with WCF for a while now and I can't seem to figure it out.\nI have a self-hosted WCF service with SSL enabled (using a signed certificate from a self-signed root CA), so far so good.

Then the compile of that file fails with same error.</p>\n\n<p>As it seems from my point of view what happens in svcutil from cmd-line and what happens when using svcutil (or what is used) from the GUI adding the same service does not generate the code with the same parameters. I guess this is partly controlled by the fact that what I try to consume is a WCF service and not a \"clean\" WSDL/webservice, and the type provider assumes that I try to use a \"clean\" webservice.</p>\n\n<p>I did not manage to find any params for svcutil takeing care of this, or any possible combinations of params, not saying that I did try all permutations of combinations, but trying the ones probable based upon (trying to) deep reading the documentation of svcutil (and I am not entirley new at using it from cmd-line).</p>\n\n<p>So far I have concluded that it is some \"missing\" params to svcutil which causes this, and that the F# type provider is not at fault.

Can I (and how do i) set up this custom validation so that I can use it like it used in the above example; so it looks something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[StreamValidation(ValidationClass, ErrorMessage = \"Serial number is invalid\")]\npublic string Ksn { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>I have constructed the following class to be my attribute:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Field, AllowMultiple = false)]\npublic class KsnValidation : ValidationAttribute\n{\n    public override bool IsValid(object value)\n    {\n        if (!(value is string)) return false;\n\n        var val = (string) value;\n        var bytes = Enumerable\n            .Range(0, val.Length / 2)\n            .Select(x =&gt; Byte.Parse(val.Substring(2 * x, 2), NumberStyles.HexNumber))\n            .ToArray();\n        return val.Length == 20 &amp;&amp; bytes.Length == 10;\n    }\n\n    public override string FormatErrorMessage(string name)\n    {\n        return base.FormatErrorMessage(name);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then decorated the following property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[KsnValidation(ErrorMessage = \"Wrong Name\")]\npublic string Ksn { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I'm not sure how to unit test this</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wcf","architecture","disaster-recovery"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2370,"score":5,"question_id":391296,"title":"WCF Pub/Sub with subscriber caching","body":"<p><strong>Problem:</strong> how to provide a distributed, scalable and disaster resistant pub/sub service with WCF.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Note that this approach is being considered in addition to messaging/middleware solutions such as Tibco EMS.</em></p>\n\n<p>I've been looking into WCF, particularly how it may be used to offer pub/sub.  On this subject this article is very good: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163537.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">WCF pub-sub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the article the author attempts to tackle the problem of having multiple publishers (as one would have with a service layer scaled across several boxes).  The problem being that if client A registers with Publisher A but Publisher B wishes to publish an event, then publisher B won't know about client A.  i.e. no one told publisher B that client A wanted to be notified about events.  The author suggests a pub/sub service as a solution.  The pub/sub service would centrally store subscriptions.  However, if I wanted to make the pub/sub service disaster resistant by having a secondary/dual pub/sub service then I have the same original problem.</p>\n\n<p>So, I think there are a couple of solutions to the problem:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Store subscriber details in a distributed cache (see questions: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/125697/wcf-application-caching-implementation\">q1</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21870/systemwebcaching-vs-enterprise-library-caching-block\">q2</a>).</li>\n<li>Store subscriber details in a database/central file system.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can anyone think of any other solutions (i.e. I've not missed some fantastic magical feature of WCF?)\nAny comments appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wcf","visual-studio"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":168,"score":0,"question_id":13092781,"title":"WCF with visual studio 2012","body":"<p>I am new WCF programming, I did followed series of Getting Started tutorials from following link</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734712.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734712.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>I have hosted service in console application but when I tried to create a client and tried to add service reference I got the following exceptions. </p>\n\n<pre><code>There was an error downloading 'http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/mex/_vti_bin/ListData.svc/$metadata'.\nThe request failed with HTTP status 405: Method Not Allowed.\nMetadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved: 'http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/mex'.\nThere was no endpoint listening at http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/mex that could accept the message.

And while my approach works, I want a better way.  </p>\n\n<p>Now I'll share details of my current working approach, to clarify what I'm trying to do.</p>\n\n<p>The client using the proxy supplies the parameter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var client = new ServiceAlphaClient();\n\nclient.InnerChannel.Extensions.Add(new ParameterHolder(\"hello\"));\n\nclient.DoSomething(\"some interesting service invocation\");\n\nclient.Close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The IExtension <code>ParameterHolder</code> looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ParameterHolder: IExtension&lt;IContextChannel&gt;\n{\n\n    public string someParam;\n\n    public ParameterHolder(string someParam)\n    {\n        this.someParam = someParam;\n    }\n\n    #region IExtension required-but-useless stuff\n    public void Attach(IContextChannel owner)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public void Detach(IContextChannel owner)\n    {\n    }\n    #endregion\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The client-side behavior-extension which uses the parameter looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    #region IClientMessageInspector\n    public void AfterReceiveReply(ref System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message reply, object correlationState)\n    {\n        //throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public object BeforeSendRequest(ref System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message request, System.ServiceModel.IClientChannel channel)\n    {\n        ParameterHolder holder = channel.Extensions.Find&lt;ParameterHolder&gt;();\n\n        string param = holder.someParam;\n\n        request.Headers.Add(MessageHeader.CreateHeader(headerName, headerNamespace, someParam));\n        return null;\n    }\n    #endregion\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I don't like about all the above:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The ClientMessageInspector extension is repeatedly calling Extensions.Find for every outgoing request.  That is both needless and inefficient.</li>\n<li>The client using my proxy must supply the parameter for each new proxy created.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding the first problem, in the inspector extension I could store and test for the value for better efficiency, but I'd rather be able to fetch this parameter just once at an earlier stage.  Specifically, I'd like the IContractBehavior itself to be able to fetch the parameter either in AddBindingParameters(...) or ApplyClientBehavior(...).  But I don't know how to reach the client channel from there.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the second problem, I'd prefer not to set the parameter on each proxy instance with Extensions.Add().  I wish I could set the parameter statically on the client, and somehow still have the behavior extension reach-back and fetch it.  I can't quite figure how to leverage a partial class to help.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway to solve these problems?

I created it with the following steps:</p>\n\n<p>1) create a <strong>new library project for the data layer</strong>, add EDMX from a database, then add ADO.NET DB context and entities generators templates. </p>\n\n<p>2) create a <strong>new library project for generic data interfaces</strong>: a repository interface, implemented in (1), and the entities t4 template with its output, moved from (1) into this project (changing the TT <em>inputFile</em> parameter so that it refers to the EDMX in the other project).</p>\n\n<p>3) create a new <strong>MVC application</strong> which uses Ninject to instantiate the generic repository declared in (2) with the SDF-based repository implemented in (1).</p>\n\n<p>The web application works fine, and I can view and edit data. Now I should expose some of its functions via a WCF service and I was looking at OData for this. So I added a new WCF Data Service, and changed the generated code just to test it, by adding the name of my entities class (as implemented in (1)) and the name of an entity set, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProjectService : DataService&lt;OrganizerEntities&gt;\n{\n    public static void InitializeService(DataServiceConfiguration config)\n    {\n        config.SetEntitySetAccessRule(\"Projects\", EntitySetRights.AllRead);\n        config.DataServiceBehavior.MaxProtocolVersion = DataServiceProtocolVersion.V2;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyway when I open the SVC in the browser I get a <em>Request Error</em>: <em>The server encountered an error processing the request. See server logs for more details.</em>. If I look at the log, I see first of all a warning like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... \n  http://msdn.microsoft.com/it-IT/library/System.ServiceModel.EvaluationContextNotFound.aspx\n  <strong>Configuration evaluation context not found</strong>.\n  ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and then an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong> exception whose details follow. In all the samples or tutorials I've found I see the typical not-so-real-world example where the data layer is not separated from the consumer application: create a new MVC app, add an EDMX, add a WCF Data Service, change some lines of generated code, and all magically works :). So I suppose this is related to my layered architecture, especially for the missing context warning. Could anyone help in using this service in a layered scenario like this? Thanks!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... Value cannot be null.

It's using the address of it's own service, not the address of the Form's service.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the relevant parts of the app.config from my Windows Service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;bindings&gt;\n      &lt;basicHttpBinding&gt;\n        &lt;binding name=\"BasicHttpBinding_IFormControlService\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/basicHttpBinding&gt;\n    &lt;/bindings&gt;\n    &lt;client&gt;\n      &lt;endpoint address=\"http://localhost:8700/FormControlService\"\n        binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"BasicHttpBinding_IFormControlService\"\n        contract=\"Form_ServiceReference.IFormControlService\" name=\"BasicHttpBinding_IFormControlService\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/client&gt;\n    &lt;services&gt;\n      &lt;service name=\"smMonitor_wcfServiceLibrary.Service1\"&gt;\n        &lt;host&gt;\n          &lt;baseAddresses&gt;\n            &lt;add baseAddress=\"http://localhost:8800/smMonitorService/\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/baseAddresses&gt;\n        &lt;/host&gt;\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" contract=\"smMonitor_wcfServiceLibrary.IService1\"&gt;              \n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;            \n        &lt;endpoint address=\"mex\" binding=\"mexHttpBinding\" contract=\"IMetadataExchange\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/service&gt;\n    &lt;/services&gt;\n    &lt;behaviors&gt;\n      &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;\n        &lt;behavior&gt;              \n          &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\" httpsGetEnabled=\"True\" /&gt;\n          &lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"False\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/behavior&gt;\n      &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;\n    &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n  &lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My setup is this.

But what if, for example, I want two WCF projects to be hosted in the same appdomain within IIS?  This implies that I would have two Visual Studio WCF projects assigned to a single IIS application.</p>\n\n<p>I started to try this out, and ran into the <a href=\"http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/archive/2010/02/17/163375.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">first error message</a>.  I've <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/5278089/284758\">seen comments</a> suggesting how \"not to do this.\"  But in my case, I actually <em>want</em> to do this.  I don't mind if this means having three web configs for the IIS application (one at the root of the IIS app, the other two in \"project\" folders it contains) or if it means having only one web config for the IIS application.  </p>\n\n<p>So for my two Visual Studio WCF projects, I've shuffled around web.config contents in a variety of ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One IIS application, pointing at the physical directory where my Visual Studio solution file is found.  The two WCF projects are in two respective subfolders</li>\n<li>One IIS application, pointing at some arbitrary physical location, containing two virtual directories pointing to the two WCF project physical directories, respectively.  I have three web config files here: one for the IIS app root, the other two in the virtual directories.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A variation of the second option above nearly worked.  The final error message I got was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The type 'Sample.ServiceGroupAlpha.ServiceAlpha', provided as the Service attribute value in the ServiceHost directive, or provided in the configuration element system.serviceModel/serviceHostingEnvironment/serviceActivations could not be found.<br>\n    <strong>Description</strong>: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.

Well, this didn't work, but I can't help but think I'm close to making this work.  I'd like to know if anyone has a fix, or can relay the \"correct\" way to accomplish this whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately the answer may be that there is no such thing as having two separate web/WCF projects within the same IIS application; I would be surprised if that was the case.  Another answer may be \"combine the two WCF projects into a single Visual Studio project/binary.\"  Please assume I don't want that answer either.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","encryption","compression","wshttpbinding","custom-binding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13052772,"title":"How to compress before encrypting message in a custom binding?","body":"<p>I have followed the example at microsoft <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751458.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751458.aspx</a> regarding creation of a custom binding to compress messages.

Only one of the 3 related elements is generated in the XML. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","vb.net","wcf","httpcontext"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13071700,"title":"Cant get IP Address From Request WCF","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/391142/how-to-get-the-ip-address-of-a-wcf-remote-endpoint\">How to get the IP address of a WCF remote endpoint?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, we have broken out our API service layer, and have started adding more exposed WCF services. </p>\n\n<p>Our legacy code all used our \"in-house\" solution for emailing errors and exceptions, and we have to put that in the API layer that we are making.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, I just implemented a <strong>IErrorHandler</strong> as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public internal class ErrorHandler:IErrorHandler\n{\n    public void ProvideFault(Exception error, MessageVersion version, ref Message fault)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public bool HandleError(Exception error)\n    {\n        Path.To.Library.CustomError.Handle(error);\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add this error handler behavior, I made a custom service behavior as shown below</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CustomError: Attribute, IServiceBehavior\n{\n    public void Validate(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void AddBindingParameters(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase, Collection&lt;ServiceEndpoint&gt; endpoints, BindingParameterCollection bindingParameters)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n        foreach (ChannelDispatcher c in serviceHostBase.ChannelDispatchers)\n        {\n            c.ErrorHandlers.Add(new ErrorHandler());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything up to this point works fine, and the call to the CustomError.Handle(...) is also being called.</p>\n\n<p>Once the following line is invoked in the <strong>ErrorHandler</strong>, it enters our legacy error handling which handles the error appropriately and emails which additionally is written in VB. (Please do not recommend another error/exception handling mechanism such as elmah because it is not my choice).</p>\n\n<p>Once this is invoked, we have the following lines that are executing pulling information off the HttpContext</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim CTX As System.Web.HttpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current\n\n//More Code...yada yada yada\n\nDim ip = CTX.Request.ServerVariables(\"REMOTE_ADDR\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem we are experiencing is SOMETIMES, we cannot get the IP address. We have tried multiple ways of getting it including REMOTE_HOST and Request.UserHostAddress, but sometimes they are not working when called from our WCF service layer. Anytime this code is called from anywhere else, it works fine and the ip shows up. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we have AspNetCompatibilityMode set to required because we need that in our WCF service.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what would be causing this, but we need to ensure that IP address is available when called from the WCF service. Is there something I have to set in the configuration for WCF to allow it to pass all the right Server Variables?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","web-services","c#-4.0"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13071301,"title":"WCF service host not connecting to test client","body":"<p>I downloaded MS WCF examples and got one setup on my local machine and running fine.

We want to expose these functionalities to the world using web services. The functionalities are modeled by interfaces (which is a very good practice when dealing with distributes systems and so on). So we have something like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>///\n/// Functionalities for a certain context, calling them A functionalities\n///\npublic interface IFunctionalitiesA {\n   FunctionalityA1ResMsg FunctionalityA1(FunctionalityA1ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityA2ResMsg FunctionalityA2(FunctionalityA2ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityA3ResMsg FunctionalityA3(FunctionalityA3ReqMsg msg);\n}\n\n///\n/// Functionalities for a certain context, calling them B functionalities\n///\npublic interface IFunctionalitiesB {\n   FunctionalityB1ResMsg FunctionalityB1(FunctionalityB1ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityB2ResMsg FunctionalityB2(FunctionalityB2ReqMsg msg);\n}\n\n///\n/// Functionalities for a certain context, calling them C functionalities\n///\npublic interface IFunctionalitiesC {\n   FunctionalityC1ResMsg FunctionalityC1(FunctionalityC1ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityC2ResMsg FunctionalityC2(FunctionalityC2ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityC3ResMsg FunctionalityC3(FunctionalityC3ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityC4ResMsg FunctionalityC4(FunctionalityC4ReqMsg msg);\n}\n\n///\n/// Functionalities for a certain context, calling them D functionalities\n///\npublic interface IFunctionalitiesD {\n   FunctionalityD1ResMsg FunctionalityD1(FunctionalityD1ReqMsg msg);\n   FunctionalityD2ResMsg FunctionalityD2(FunctionalityD2ReqMsg msg);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let us consider that all these functionalities can be implemented by some services. But it is not mandatory to have a service to implement them all. A service can implement some of them and another service can implement another subset of those. In particular I am asking to consider the following situation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>///\n/// This service implements functionalities A and B.\n///\npublic class ServiceS1 : IFunctionalitiesA, IFunctionalitiesB {\n   ... /* Implementing interfaces methods */\n}\n\n///\n/// This service implements functionalities C and D.\n///\npublic class ServiceS2 : IFunctionalitiesC, IFunctionalitiesD {\n   ... /* Implementing interfaces methods */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In particular please note that these two services will create, internally, some important stuff. I mean that they have resources that only them can access, for example the first service might keep an array of elements and so does the second. In few words, they are not dummy services, they have a state and resources and they are protected from external access (so they are declared as <code>public</code> or <code>protected</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Now let us consider that we want to implement a service, maybe to be run on a different station, that implements all functionalities. This service will behave exactly like the two presented above when dealing with the respective implemented methods. Unfortunately we cannot derive from both of them. So we need to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class GlobalService : \n   IFunctionalitiesA, IFunctionalitiesB, IFunctionalitiesC, IFunctionalitiesD {\n   ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Encapsulation... can it be the answer?</h2>\n\n<p>The question is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How to reuse the logic inside the two services implementing a subset\n  of the overall functionalities?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I ended up thinking about doing something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class GlobalService : \n   IFunctionalitiesA, IFunctionalitiesB, IFunctionalitiesC, IFunctionalitiesD {\n\n   ///\n   /// Encapsulating ServiceS1\n   ///\n   protected ServiceS1 srvs1;\n\n   ///\n   /// Encapsulating ServiceS2\n   ///\n   protected ServiceS2 srvs2;\n\n   public GlobalService() {\n      this.srvs1 = new ServiceS1();\n      this.srvc2 = new ServiceS2();\n   }\n\n   ///\n   /// Methods are redirected internally to the reused implementation\n   /// This is to be done for all methods\n   ///\n   public FunctionalityA1ResMsg FunctionalityA1(FunctionalityA1ReqMsg msg) {\n      return thissrvs1.FunctionalityA1(msg);\n   }\n\n   ...\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By doing so I can reuse the implemented logic without creating redundant code again and again. Of course this can be an approach limited to some cases, but in these conditions (not so restrictive after all). </p>\n\n<p>Is this a good approach to solve the problem? Do you think differently? </p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","soap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":13005635,"title":"SOAP Response WCF Web service","body":"<p>I am working on a SOAP based Web Service.

I found <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3740193/can-wcf-self-hosted-applications-create-servicehosts-automatically-using-the-app\">this question</a></strong> which mentions a possible solution of dynamically enumerating services listed in app.config at runtime, and creating a ServiceHost for each.</p>\n\n<p>However, my services, contracts, and the hosting application are all in different assemblies.

When they try to access my service, I want the username and password to validate through the overriden Validate method of the UserNamePasswordValidator, which is currently defined as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public override void Validate(string userName, string password)\n{\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(userName))\n            throw new ArgumentNullException(\"userName\");\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(password))\n            throw new ArgumentNullException(\"password\");\n\n        // check if the user is not test\n        if (userName != \"test\" || password != \"test\")\n            throw new FaultException(\"Username and Password Failed\");\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am just using test and test as an example for the username and password.  I know I have to set the modify the behavior configuration and do a binding configuration, so the service will use the CustomUserNamePasswordValidator, but since I don't know PHP, I am not sure how to send the credentials from php to the wcf service and once the credentials are sent, I don't know how to set it in the wcf service.  I am not creating a wcf service.  I thought I could do <code>client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName</code> and <code>client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password</code>, but this is only if I am creating .NET client which I am not.</p>\n\n<p>Another question I had was that if the client is a php client, am I restricted to only basicHttpBinding?</p>\n\n<p>Also,  ideally what I would like to do is send a soap request from the php client to the wcf service, so if anyone can point me in the right direction for this, it would be great.</p>\n\n<p>I just tried the following, but it didn't work (Add was called, but it wasn't authenticated)</p>\n\n<pre><code>$sh_param = array('userName' =&gt; 'test', 'passWord' =&gt; 'test2');\n\n$headers = new SoapHeader('http://localhost:8731/MathService.svc','UserCredentials',   \n$sh_param,false);\n\n$client-&gt;__setSoapHeaders(array($headers));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nMy PHP Soap Client initialization is now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$client = new SoapClient('http://localhost:8731/MathService?wsdl',\n                         array('login' =&gt; \"test2\", \n                               'password' =&gt; \"test\",\n                               'trace'=&gt;1));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By doing the above, it added the following in the Request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>`Authorization: Basic dGVzdDI6dGVzdA==`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, my wcf service which is hosted in a console app, is not picking up this authorization, I have a custom username validator which has a hard-coded value of test for the username and test for the password, but when I try \"test2\" for the login, it is still calling the method.

I have written a WCF service which calls into one of our vendor's code bases to perform operations, such as Login, Logout, etc. A requirement of this operation is that we have a background thread to receive events as a result of that action. For example, the Login action is sent on the main thread. Then, several events are received back from the vendor service as a result of the login. There can be 1, 2, or several events received. The background thread, which runs on a timer, receives these events and fires an event in the wcf service to notify that a new event has arrived.</p>\n\n<p>I have implemented the WCF service in Duplex mode, and planned to use callbacks to notify the UI that events have arrived.

I created a WCF service that I host via a windows service. This service has been working fine for a while, and I have a windows forms and a web interface to it. The service was originally developed on XP but I have recently migrated to Windows 7. When I migrated, I found out that the windows security for the service prevented me from using my WinForms app on windows 7, yet it worked just fine on XP talking to the service on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 and XP. To simplify things while in development, I have disabled security completely, and my WinForms app works again on windows7.</p>\n\n<p>I then made some other changes to the WCF service, adding methods, changing data contracts, etc. The only endpoint changes were to disable security on wshttp. Suddenly, updating the service reference for the web app no longer creates the client proxy, but it does generate the wsdl and xsd files. I have tried numerous combinations of the older and newer service on XP and Win7 with the result that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The old service works fine when updating the reference, whether it runs on XP or Win7 and whether the web app code is on XP or Win7.</li>\n<li>The new service does not create the proxy, whether run on XP or Win7 and whether the web app code is on XP or Win7. I get no errors from the service reference update, however, the <code>configuration.svcinfo</code> and <code>configuration91.svcinfo</code> files have no behaviors, bindings or endpoints listed. The rest of the files look fine.</li>\n<li>I am able to use <code>svcutil</code> to get the metadata and to generate the proxy code using the new version of the service.</li>\n<li>When the service reference is updated, I do get two of the items that are part of the data contract showing up in object explorer, but only one of them is correct. I get no client, or other data contract objects.</li>\n<li>The kicker is that the windows forms app works just fine with the new service, including updating the reference and calling the service methods. Huh?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have looked at the service, behavior and endpoint definitions in the new service and they match the old one. Nothing online that I could find references such an error. I realize that I must be doing something wrong in the new code, but since it works fine with WinForms app, I am at a loss to explain the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps I can keep some of my hair ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Edit-</strong></p>\n\n<p>After reading the answer I did some more research and tried a few more things:</p>\n\n<p>I have looked at the xsd, etc files for the service with no security and also after restoring things to the way they were in terms of top-level enums with <code>DataContract</code> attribute (have none of these) and also restoring the security values to what they used to be. In both cases, I see nothing amiss, except that the files are named differently: the old service reference uses xsd files with numeric suffixes that range from 2 - 5, whereas the latest one uses 1 - 4 (can't see that this should affect things, since the pointers in the svcmap seem correct). It does make it more difficult to diff things, but I have looked at each file in detail and the data seems correct, just placed into different files.</p>\n\n<p>The wsdl file, after security is restored to the old values is identical except for the host IP and machine name, as expected. But still the <code>configuration.svcinfo</code> and <code>configuration91.svcinfo</code> have no endpoints, behaviors or bindings defined. Also, oddly, of the two data contracts that do get defined, one only has a New member: its data members are not present. This is a data contract that references a class that is marked as <code>Serializable</code>, but is not listed with a <code>DataContract</code> attribute. The only thing that has changed there is that I added a single new string member to the class. What is even more odd is that there is a proper definition of the data contract class in the xsd files.</p>\n\n<p>I'm very confused.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","wcf","rest","web-config","iis5"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":237,"score":1,"question_id":12317227,"title":"Hosting .NET 4.0 REST WCF service on IIS 5.1 (Windows XP) issue 404 (The resource cannot be found)","body":"<p>I've got a WCF-based RESTful API (.NET Framework 4.0) which works fine when hosting on IIS 7.0 (Win7) or IIS 6.0 (Server 2003).

After the proxy is initialized, I send a <code>Connect</code> message to the server:</p>\n\n<pre><code> _proxy.InnerChannel.Faulted += new EventHandler(InnerChannel_Faulted);\n _proxy.InnerChannel.Closing += new EventHandler(InnerChannel_Closing);\n //send a connect message to the server\n _proxy.ClientConnected(ClientHostName, Version, ClientID, ClientIP); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the server has a reference to the connected client, by using </p>\n\n<pre><code>OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel&lt;IClientEvents&gt;()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is pretty straight forward, nothing fancy. However, I'm having a bit of trouble with making the client reconnecting to the server after the server went online. In my scenario, I will have up to 50-100 clients connected to the server and they will rarely communicate with the server, let's say in average, 1 request per hour.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to achieve is to have the client \"hanging\" while the is offline, for this I try to reinitialize the communication channel on the client side every time the channel ends up in <code>Faulted</code> state, which works ok. But when I try to close the server, I get the following message</p>\n\n<pre><code>This could be because a client failed to close a sessionful channel within the required time.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm now struggling to find the most appropriate implementation for my scenario:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Not closing the channel after the service call</strong>. This way the client will always try to recreate the channel once the connection with the server is down (e.g. interval of 1 min). Doesn't make much sense to keep the channel opened all this time though, so I'm not that sure about this approach.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing the channel after each call</strong> and recreate when making a new call to the server. This works fine when making service calls, but what happens if the server wants to send a notification the client? The callback reference on the server side will not be valid anymore, I'd have to wait for the client to send a new connect message to get the new callback reference, right? In this case, should I regularly have a different call similar to a Ping() to the server in order to ensure that the server can always contact the client?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm still reading materials on WCF duplex operations, just can't decide which approach is better so that I don't run into problems later on.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your advice!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","entity-framework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":1,"question_id":12950145,"title":"WCF DataContractSerializer","body":"<p>I am getting the following error when trying to return a \nQuestionnaire object to the client.

When I turn off the ServiceHost then I can see my web site but the ClientAccessPolicy.xml is gone.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried using a complete path for the endpoint URI:</p>\n\n<pre><code>policyUri.Scheme = \"http\";\npolicyUri.Port = 80;\npolicyUri.Query = \"ClientAccessPolicy.xml\";\nhost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IPolicyGetter), new WebHttpBinding(), policyUri.ToString()).Behaviors.Add(new WebHttpBehavior());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but this throws an argument exception. Moving the policy to a subdirectory or a different port will not work because Silverlight only looks at port 80 on the root web directory.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I can just copy the ClientAccessPolicy.xml into the web root directory and disable the policy endpoint. Is there a way to button-down the endpoint so that it only hijacks calls to ClientAccessPolicy.xml but does not steal the entire IIS port 80?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","endpoints","wcf-endpoint","wcf-routing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":282,"score":3,"question_id":5704401,"title":"WCF routing backuplists - logging when they are used","body":"<p>Is there anyway to add some logging or a behaviour to the WCF routing list so that I can log when the routing has made use of an endpoint on a backup list?</p>\n\n<pre><code>     &lt;filterTables&gt;\n        &lt;filterTable name=\"RoutingTable\"&gt;\n          &lt;add filterName=\"Filter1\" endpointName=\"EP1\" priority=\"0\" backupList=\"FailOver\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/filterTable&gt;\n      &lt;/filterTables&gt;\n      &lt;backupLists&gt;\n        &lt;backupList name=\"FailOver\"&gt;\n          &lt;add endpointName=\"EP2\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/backupList&gt;\n      &lt;/backupLists&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Could a behaviour somehow log which endpoint had finally been used by the routing service?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wcf","web-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":64,"score":-2,"question_id":12958652,"title":"Not able to Access the url with username and password credentials?","body":"<p>I am facing a problem in my code:-\nI am trying to access a url for sending Acknowledgement.

One project is an ASP.NET Web Application Project, and one is a class library. The web application has a project reference to the class library. Neither of these is strongly-named.</p>\n\n<p>In the class library, which I'll call \"Framework,\" I have an endpoint behavior (an IEndpointBehavior implementation) and a configuration element (a class derived from BehaviorExtensionsElement). The configuration element is so I can attach the endpoint behavior to a service via configuration.</p>\n\n<p>In the web application, I have an AJAX-enabled WCF service. In web.config, I have the AJAX service configured to use my custom behavior. The system.serviceModel section of the configuration is pretty standard and looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n &lt;behaviors&gt;\n  &lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n   &lt;behavior name=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n    &lt;enableWebScript /&gt;\n    &lt;customEndpointBehavior /&gt;\n   &lt;/behavior&gt;\n  &lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;\n &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n &lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n &lt;services&gt;\n &lt;service name=\"WebSite.AjaxService\"&gt;\n  &lt;endpoint\n           address=\"\"\n           behaviorConfiguration=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"\n           binding=\"webHttpBinding\"\n           contract=\"WebSite.AjaxService\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/service&gt;\n &lt;/services&gt;\n &lt;extensions&gt;\n  &lt;behaviorExtensions&gt;\n   &lt;add\n       name=\"customEndpointBehavior\"\n       type=\"Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/behaviorExtensions&gt;\n &lt;/extensions&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At runtime, this works perfectly. The AJAX enabled WCF service correctly uses my custom configured endpoint behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is when I try to add a new AJAX WCF service. If I do Add -> New Item... and select \"AJAX-enabled WCF Service,\" I can watch it add the .svc file and codebehind, but when it gets to updating the web.config file, I get this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The configuration file is not a valid configuration file for WCF Service Library.</p>\n  \n  <p>The type 'Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' registered for extension 'customEndpointBehavior' could not be loaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously the configuration is entirely valid since it works perfectly at runtime. If I remove the  element from my behavior configuration temporarily and then add the AJAX-enabled WCF Service, everything goes without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in a larger project where we will have multiple services with various configurations, removing all of the custom behaviors temporarily is going to be error prone. While I realize I could go without using the wizard and do everything manually, not everyone can, and it'd be nice to be able to just use the product as it was meant to be used - wizards and all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why isn't my custom WCF behavior extension element type being found?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Updates/clarifications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It does work at runtime, just not design time.</li>\n<li>The Framework assembly is in the web project's bin folder when I attempt to add the service.</li>\n<li>While I could add services manually (\"without configuration\"), I need the out-of-the-box item template to work - that's the whole goal of the question.</li>\n<li>This issue is being seen in Visual Studio 2008. <strong>In VS 2010 this appears to be resolved.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://connect.microsoft.com/wcf/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=386511\" rel=\"nofollow\">I filed this issue on Microsoft Connect</a> and it turns out you either have to put your custom configuration element in the GAC or put it in the IDE folder.

This indicates to me that the custom token is never being sent across the wire. I assume this is because the call to CreateSecurityTokenProvider() never returned my custom token provider, since the SecurityTokenRequirement is never passed in indicating my custom token is needed.</p>\n\n<p>On the client side, I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CentralAuthorizationManagerClient : ClientBase&lt;ICentralAuthorizationManager&gt;, ICentralAuthorizationManager, IDisposable\n{\n\tpublic PFPrincipal GenerateToken()\n\t{\n\t\tif (!this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Contains(typeof(CentralAuthCredentials)))\n\t\t\tthrow new ArgumentException(\"Must set CentralAuthCredentials before calling this method.\");\n\t\treturn base.Channel.GenerateToken();\n\t}\n\n\tpublic PFPrincipal GenerateToken(CentralAuthToken token)\n\t{\n\t\tthis.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Remove&lt;ClientCredentials&gt;();\n\t\tthis.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new CentralAuthCredentials(token));\n\t\treturn this.GenerateToken();\n\t}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These methods are basically supposed to remove the default credentials from the endpoint and attach a new instance of my custom CentralAuthCredentials. (I grabbed this Remove/Add combo from an MSDN article somewhere).</p>\n\n<p>In the configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\t&lt;behaviors&gt;\n\t\t&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;behavior name=\"Server2ServerEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;clientCredentials type=\"MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;clientCertificate findValue=\"localhost\" x509FindType=\"FindBySubjectName\" storeLocation=\"CurrentUser\" storeName=\"My\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;serviceCertificate&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;authentication certificateValidationMode=\"None\" revocationMode=\"NoCheck\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;/serviceCertificate&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/clientCredentials&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/behavior&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;\n\t&lt;/behaviors&gt;\n\n\t&lt;bindings&gt;\n\t\t&lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;binding name=\"wsHttpServer2Server\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;security mode=\"Message\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;message clientCredentialType=\"UserName\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/security&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/binding&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/wsHttpBinding&gt;\n\t&lt;/bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the behavior's clientCredentials type is set to my custom client credentials. However, at the moment I still have the binding's clientCredentialType set to \"UserName\". This brings up my <strong>2nd question</strong>: What the heck should clientCredentialType=\"?\" be set to if I'm using custom credentials? According to MSDN, the available values for <em>Message</em> security are: <em>None</em>, <em>Windows</em>, <em>UserName</em>, <em>Certificate</em>, and <em>IssuedToken</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? Hopefully I'm just missing something simple?  There are like 6 more classes to the entire implementation, but I tried to only include the bits needed to understand the situation...</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've been working on this all day, and thanks to a few sources, I realized that part of what I was missing was the very last step on <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731872.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, which is adding the TokenParameters to the binding, so that the binding knows what the token looks like. That is the answer to my original 1st question; \"what the heck sets up the token requirements?\" Answer: the TokenParameters assigned to the binding.</p>\n\n<p>So now I added the following extension which sets the TokenParameters on the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public sealed class CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension : BindingElementExtensionElement\n{\n\tpublic CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension()\n\t\t: base()\n\t{\n\t}\n\n\tpublic override Type BindingElementType\n\t{\n\t\tget { return typeof(SymmetricSecurityBindingElement); }\n\t}\n\n\tprotected override System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement CreateBindingElement()\n\t{\n\t\tX509SecurityTokenParameters protectionParams = new X509SecurityTokenParameters();\n\t\tprotectionParams.InclusionMode = SecurityTokenInclusionMode.Never;\n\n\t\tSymmetricSecurityBindingElement innerBindingElement = new SymmetricSecurityBindingElement();\n\t\tinnerBindingElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SignedEncrypted.Add(new CentralAuthTokenParameters());\n\t\t//innerBindingElement.MessageProtectionOrder = MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt;\n\t\tinnerBindingElement.ProtectionTokenParameters = protectionParams;\n\n\t\treturn innerBindingElement;\n\t}\n}\n\n\t&lt;extensions&gt;\n\t\t&lt;bindingElementExtensions&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;add name=\"CentralAuthCreds\" type=\"MyApp.Security.Configuration.CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension, MyApp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/bindingElementExtensions&gt;\n\t&lt;/extensions&gt;\n\n\t&lt;bindings&gt;\n\t\t&lt;customBinding&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;binding name=\"wsHttpServer2Server\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;CentralAuthCreds /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;binaryMessageEncoding /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;httpTransport /&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/binding&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/customBinding&gt;\n\t&lt;/bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well that gets me a step further. Now I get a new exception on the server: </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"The security token manager cannot create a token authenticator for requirement ...\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like WCF is using some default token manager to try to deal with my custom token, instead of my custom token handler (my custom token handler's constructor is never called).  I <em>think</em> this is happening because for the <em>client</em>, I have this config:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n    &lt;behavior name=\"Server2ServerEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n        &lt;clientCredentials type=\"MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But on the <em>server</em> I don't have any equivalent to let it know about the custom client credentials. So, <strong>new question</strong>: Where in the config for the server do I tell it what the custom ClientCredentials are?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I finally figured out a bit more of the puzzle.  I had only implemented a ClientCredentials implementation, thinking that the client sends creds, and thats it. The client doesnt authenticate the service, so I don't need custom ServiceCredentials.  Well, I was wrong. The specified ServiceCredentials authenticates the token from the ClientCredentials, and vice-versa.

There are a couple of ways I'm considering:\n1) Have a completely separate service that allows the client to change settings, and then somehow have the services share the settings contract.\n2) Add a second Interface (for the settings) that this service implements and the settings contract will be within the service as well.</p>\n\n<p>The first approach, I'm thinking it will be difficult to share these settings. However, I am using MEF, so it could be that this will make it easier. </p>\n\n<p>As for the second approach, will that even work? Can I implement two service contracts with the same service class? If so, would I have to host the services separately?</p>\n\n<p>I guess the other option is to just have all of the settings methods in the same service, but I wanted to separate them if possible so that when a client, who doesn't care about the settings, connects, they don't have to worry about those methods.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had to do something similar?

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke(Method = \"GET\", UriTemplate = \"/PutMessage/{jsonString}\", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\nstring PutMessage(string jsonString);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I call http:///MyWebService/PutMessage/{MyJsonString} I get passed on the the method, and all is well (more or less).</p>\n\n<p>But then what does it mean when I define this as a <strong>POST</strong> instead?</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke(Method = \"POST\", UriTemplate = \"/PutMessage/{jsonString}\", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\nstring PutMessage(string jsonString);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>What does the UriTemplate do here?</strong> If I do a POST, I expect the data to be contained not in the URI, but in the \"data section\" of the post. But do I define the variable name in the data section? How does the WebServiceHost/.NET know that what is contained in the \"data section\" of the post is to be put into the variable jsonString? How do I post the data from the client side (not C#, let's say JQuery instead) so that it is interpreted correctly on the serer side?</p>\n\n<p>(And how does the WebMessageFormat affet things? I have read everywhere about this (MSDN, Stackoverflow etc) but haven't found a clear and good answer.)</p>\n\n<h1>Question 2:</h1>\n\n<p>In my attempts to understand this, I thought I'd make a very simple POST-method, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke]\nstring PutJSONRequest(string pc);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then <em>try</em> call this method using Fiddler, but that does not work at all. I just get a 400 error back, saying \"HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\". I have a breakpoint on the very first line in the code of the method, and the method itself contains nothing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string PutJSONRequest(string pc)\n{\n    return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Again, how does .NET know that what I POSTed using Fiddler should be contained in the \"string pc\"?</strong> How does it interpret it as a string, and what type of string (UT8, ASCII etc)?</p>\n\n<p>This is the RAW HTTP request, sent from Fiddler:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST http://&lt;myip&gt;:8093/AlfaCustomerApp/PutJSONRequest HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Fiddler\nHost: &lt;myip&gt;:8093\nContent-Length: 3\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\n\nasd\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it doesnt matter what type of Content-type I use, as far as I can see.</p>\n\n<p>The response is a standard-thing, that I am not in control of myself:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Length: 1165\nContent-Type: text/html\nServer: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0\nDate: Mon, 15 Oct 2012 15:45:02 GMT\n\n[then HTML code]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.

However, after deploying to the server I was hitting the error described here: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9591929/can-anyone-spot-why-i-keep-getting-this-error-testing-the-ef-5-beta\">Can anyone spot why I keep getting this error testing the EF 5 beta</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After doing as suggested - uninstalling and re-installing EF5 via NuGet, I am now getting a timeout error when trying to test the service.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically the timeout occurs when attempting to execute the following Linq:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var games = from m in _db.Members\n        join s in _db.UkSyndicates\n            on m.MemberId equals s.MemberId\n        where m.PaymentMethod == \"Credit/Debit Card\"\n        &amp;&amp; EntityFunctions.TruncateTime(s.NextChargeDate) &lt;=  EntityFunctions.TruncateTime(DateTime.Now)\n        &amp;&amp; !string.IsNullOrEmpty(m.AibCustomerReference)\n        &amp;&amp; (m.StatusId == 105 || m.StatusId == 113)\n        select new BillingItem\n        {\n            Id = s.Id,\n            SyndicateId = s.SyndicateId,\n            MemberId = s.MemberId,\n            LastDrawId = s.LastDrawId,\n            LastPaidGame = s.LastPaidGame,\n            NextChargeDate = s.NextChargeDate,\n            Protected = s.Protected,\n            PaymentFrequency = (int)(s.PaymentFrequency*4),\n            CurrencyCode = m.CurrencyCode,\n            AibCustomerReference = m.AibCustomerReference,\n            WeeklyFee = (from f in _db.GameFees where f.FeeName == \"UK_LOTTO_FEE\" &amp;&amp; f.CurrencyCode == m.CurrencyCode select f.Amount).FirstOrDefault(),\n            GameCode = game,\n            PostCode = m.PostCode,\n            CountryCode = m.CountryCode,\n            EmailAddress = m.Email\n        };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There may well be a more efficient way to write this query - I'm fairly inexperienced with Linq and EF, but I would stress this did NOT time-out prior to the uninstall and re-install of EF.  In fact it returned data fairly quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I can't see any reason this would timeout after the re-install of EF, nothing in the code has changed, but need a solution to this fast!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify the error I'm getting, it's at the point that EF tries to execute the above query, I get an <strong>EntityCommandExecutionException</strong> thrown.  The exception message is \"An error occurred while executing the command definition.  See the inner exception for details.\"  The inner exception is \"Timeout expired.

I find this kind of weird.... but, after the report screen loads, if the user sits there and doesn't click on anything (but doesn't sit there long enough to actually be logged out, maybe just 5 min or so), I get this error:\n<strong>'Load operation failed for query 'GetStuff'.

I can only get this to work if the stream is the only paramater.</p>\n\n<p>I've gone back to basics with a simple Hello World service.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code on the client </p>\n\n<pre><code>static string Test()\n{\n    HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(\"http://localhost:1884/MyAPI/Service.svc/HelloWorld\");\n    req.Method = \"POST\";\n    req.ContentType = \"text/plain\";\n    Stream reqStream = req.GetRequestStream();\n    byte[] fileToSend = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"sometext\");\n    reqStream.Write(fileToSend, 0, fileToSend.Length);\n    reqStream.Close();\n    HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse();\n    var sr = new StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream());\n    return sr.ReadToEnd();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this is the code on the service</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    [WebInvoke(Method = \"POST\", UriTemplate = \"HelloWorld\")]\n    Stream HelloWorld(Stream content);\n}\n\npublic Stream HelloWorld(Stream content)\n{\n    var sr = new StreamReader(content);\n    string text = sr.ReadToEnd();\n    return new System.IO.MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Hello World! \" + text)); \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This all works fine. Then I make this change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    [WebInvoke(Method = \"POST\", UriTemplate = \"HelloWorld/test/{test}\")]\n    Stream HelloWorld(string test, Stream content);\n}\n\npublic Stream HelloWorld(string test, Stream content)\n{\n    var sr = new StreamReader(content);\n    string text = sr.ReadToEnd();\n    return new System.IO.MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Hello World! \" + text + test)); \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And change the client code to hit HelloWorld/test/sometext</p>\n\n<p>I get a 500 Internal Server Error. I've tried about 10 different variations including using a ?key=value type UriTemplate, returning strings instead of streams etc, and no luck.</p>\n\n<p>Feels like I'm missing some tiny little thing that is going to make this work, as I have seen countless examples of exactly this all over the web. Theirs works, mine doesn't.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wcf","error-handling","wcf-4","wcf-extensions"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":0,"question_id":12892055,"title":"WCF IParameterInspector + IErrorHandler","body":"<p>If I have both <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.iparameterinspector.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IParameterInspector</code></a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.ierrorhandler.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IErrorHandler</code></a> attached to a service can I be sure <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.ierrorhandler.handleerror.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IErrorHandler.HandleError()</code></a> will be called on the same thread where <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.iparameterinspector.beforecall.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IParameterInspector.BeforeCall()</code></a> is called?</p>\n\n<p>I need this because in case of a fault thrown <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.iparameterinspector.aftercall.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IParameterInspector.AfterCall()</code></a> is never called and there is no way (as far as I know) I can get correlation state object created in <code>BeforeCall()</code>.

The <strong>logout</strong> API call will throw an exception if you try to <strong>logout</strong> without being logged in.

If I try to <strong>logout</strong> again it throws the exception as expected.</p>\n\n<p>The cookies seem to be working in that even when constructing both a new interface client and a new wrapper client on each page, the cookies persist.</p>\n\n<p>While this isn't a bad thing, I am perplexed as to how it is working. Is there somewhere that ASP.NET/WCF is saving these cookies for the session?

And I can see all properties of image like width,height, dpi.</p>\n\n<p>But when I open the uploaded image file property, I can see only size of the file.\nAnd then I want to see the files on notepade.\nThere is difference between the original file and uploaded file.\nThat is</p>\n\n<pre><code>--kpKP7FRpS5aYCWRNH0NHd0tGRj7hs2QYhVai_\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"imageData\"; filename=\"ty-uz.jpg\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then I see a tag too on bottom of file as     --kpKP7FRpS5aYCWRNH0NHd0tGRj7hs2QYhVai_--</p>\n\n<p>Android adds the tags on the original image file before sending, And then I can't see it as image.\nSo What is the problem? I use same WCF on silverlight application, IT runs very well. No problem. Image files uploads orginialy. </p>\n\n<p>But My android application adds the tags in the image file.

Try to eliminate the DB as the bottleneck by having it perform as little processing as possible (Could send xml blob to DB, but it would have to perform the xml shredding). </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","wcf","jqgrid","internet-explorer-6"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":97,"score":0,"question_id":12694742,"title":"JQGrid POST doesn't include postData when using IE6","body":"<p>Using Fiddler2, when using IE6, I see that the POST request does not contain the postData specified below.

This has been like talking to my diary, but maybe this will help someone else along the line.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, I am able to get the data back (verified via Fiddler) via a separate AJAX call, and bound to the grid using the AddJSONData() method.  The debugger pops at the end of the datatype: callback function... But if I let it continue execution, IE6 hangs at this point.

I wrote a test ajax call to the GetData service method, and it populated the POST data fine in the body, and returns all the grid data.  Ok, so JQGrid is NOT setting the parameters in the request body, do I have JQGrid misconfigured?  Please advise!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Well sure not getting much lovin'..  in the serializeGridData function, it turns out that the JSON2 stringify is treating the postData like a string?  The quotes around the key names are getting escaped:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IE6: \"{\\\"path\\\":\\\"c:\\\\Source\\\\TestUpload\\\\Uploads\\\\5ec33030-ab7b-4480-9deb-3153726c1ede.xls\\\",\\\"_search\\\":true,\\\"nd\\\":1349365262553,\\\"rows\\\":15,\\\"page\\\":1,\\\"sidx\\\":\\\"IDNumber\\\",\\\"sord\\\":\\\"desc\\\"}\"\n\nIE9:  {\"path\":\"c:\\\\Source\\\\TestUpload\\\\Uploads\\\\3228b61e-4f1b-4ce4-813e-10f58b1b4285.xls\",\"_search\":true,\"nd\":1349365395840,\"rows\":15,\"page\":1,\"sidx\":\"IDNumber\",\"sord\":\"desc\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ok, so I used the compose functionality of Fiddler to modify the IE6 JQGrid request, using a valid session cookie, and just adding the POST data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"path\":\"c:\\\\Source\\\\TestUpload\\\\Uploads\\\\cb238b83-3c6e-42c2-92be-0e8d08dd905e.xls\",\"_search\":true,\"nd\":1349284471504,\"rows\":15,\"page\":1,\"sidx\":\"IDNumber\",\"sord\":\"desc\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and it worked just fine.  So for some reason, JQGrid isn't populating the POST data for IE6?  Any ideas?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Of note is that the content-length is correct in the request header, there's just no associated POST data.

Let me try to explain the circumstances, so please bare with me...</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I have a .net WCF service (IIS hosted) that is called directly by some existing clients (third party, for them this is new functionality) and also over web (browser, web client is asp.net, written by us, also IIS hosted). I would like to keep the WCF service stateless. The channel has to be secured: the traffic has to be encrypted and clients and service have to be authenticated to each other (server methods also have to know who the caller client is). Each client already has a X509 certificate in a local store. Digital signature of client content is also a near future requirement.</p>\n\n<p>My first problem is that clients have to be \"dynamically\" registered on the server: some administration module will generate some username/password credentials for them and they will register themselves (they will basically \"upload\" their existing client certificate) with that credentials at first login.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to achive my requirements by existing .net security infrastructure? How would WCF have to be configured to achieve that? I have already explored mutual authentication but it looks like that each client certificate has to be in a server store and also mapped to a windows user - that I would like to avoid if possible. Is it even possible (or at least desirable) for WCF method to register a windows user and copy it's certificate to some server store?</p>\n\n<p>The second problem as I see it is that asp.net application has to somehow \"forward\" client certificate (chosen in a web browser) so that the WCF method has user certificate (same way as in a direct WCF service call).</p>\n\n<p>After few days of trial-and-error I have come up with a very straightforward and highly custom solution (which is not always a good thing). I would create a Login method with a \"secret\" string parameter, which would be a predefined string, encrypted with user certificate's private key. On the server I would keep all user's public keys (in a database), so I could dynamically add new users providing public key in registration procedure. If the \"secret\", decrypted with user's public key was that predefined value, the user is authenticated and some session token (say, GUID) is generated, saved to database and returned to user. Every method called from now on expects this token, verifies it in database - otherwise it rejects the user. This way, the database holds service's state. The channel would be encrypted (SSL, server-side certificate) so I don't see the problem transfering the session token around in every call.</p>\n\n<p>The problems that I see in this solution: third party clients have to implement the login (encryption) procedure and keep the session token - overhead? And the other: encrypting some string with private key inside web browser (we have to support IE, FF, and Chrome, so it's probably not trivial).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I'm missing something obvious here. Any comments, ideas or propositions would be highly appreciated. I'm also available for any additional information.

I've found nothing really interesting in the log (but maybe I didn't search in the correct places).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover - when sendTimeout is set to large value (say 10 minutes), it looks like all additional messages sent from server to client are \"stuck\" - never received by the client and no exceptions are thrown until the send timeout is reached.

I am going to be sending custom headers in my SOAP envelopes to verify that the requests are coming from our app, and I just want to keep predators from sniffing the line and picking out the custom headers. </p>\n\n<p>Now to the code, where i must just have some stupid little setting wrong, because from all i've read, this should be a fairly straightforward exercise. </p>\n\n<p>First, my service's code-behind class is decorated with the following attributes: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ServiceBehavior(AddressFilterMode:=AddressFilterMode.Any)&gt; \n&lt;AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode:=AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The ServiceModel section of my web.config on the server looks like so: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;bindings&gt;\n        &lt;basicHttpBinding&gt;\n            &lt;binding name=\"basicHttpBinding\"&gt;\n                &lt;security mode=\"Transport\"&gt;\n                    &lt;transport clientCredentialType =\"None\"/&gt;\n                &lt;/security&gt;\n            &lt;/binding&gt;\n        &lt;/basicHttpBinding&gt;\n    &lt;/bindings&gt;\n    &lt;behaviors&gt;\n        &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;\n            &lt;behavior name=\"standingsBehavior\"&gt;\n                &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"true\" httpsGetEnabled=\"true\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"false\"/&gt;\n                &lt;/behavior&gt;\n            &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;\n    &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n    &lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=\"true\"&gt;\n        &lt;baseAddressPrefixFilters&gt;\n            &lt;add prefix=\"http://www.mydomain.com:80\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/baseAddressPrefixFilters&gt;\n    &lt;/serviceHostingEnvironment&gt;\n    &lt;services&gt;\n        &lt;service behaviorConfiguration=\"standingsBehavior\" name=\"lijslwebdata\"&gt;\n            &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" contract=\"lijslwebdata\"/&gt;\n            &lt;!--&lt;endpoint address=\"mex\" binding=\"mexHttpBinding\" contract=\"IMetadataExchange\"/&gt;--&gt;\n        &lt;/service&gt;\n    &lt;/services&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the ServiceModel section of the app.config in my Windows application looks like the following: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;bindings&gt;\n        &lt;basicHttpBinding&gt;\n            &lt;binding name=\"BasicHttpBinding_lijslwebdata\" closeTimeout=\"00:01:00\"\n                openTimeout=\"00:01:00\" receiveTimeout=\"00:10:00\" \n                sendTimeout=\"00:01:00\" allowCookies=\"false\" \n                bypassProxyOnLocal=\"false\" hostNameComparisonMode=\"StrongWildcard\"\n                maxBufferSize=\"65536\" maxBufferPoolSize=\"524288\" \n                maxReceivedMessageSize=\"65536\" messageEncoding=\"Text\" \n                textEncoding=\"utf-8\" transferMode=\"Buffered\"\n                useDefaultWebProxy=\"true\"&gt;\n                &lt;readerQuotas maxDepth=\"32\" maxStringContentLength=\"8192\"\n                    maxArrayLength=\"16384\"\n                    maxBytesPerRead=\"4096\" maxNameTableCharCount=\"16384\" /&gt;\n                &lt;security mode=\"Transport\"&gt;\n                    &lt;transport clientCredentialType=\"None\" proxyCredentialType=\"None\" realm=\"\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;message clientCredentialType=\"UserName\" algorithmSuite=\"Default\" /&gt;\n                &lt;/security&gt;\n            &lt;/binding&gt;\n        &lt;/basicHttpBinding&gt;\n    &lt;/bindings&gt;\n    &lt;client&gt;\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"https://www.mydomain.com/mysubdir/myservice.svc\"\n            binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" \n            bindingConfiguration=\"BasicHttpBinding_lijslwebdata\"\n            contract=\"xdata.lijslwebdata\" name=\"BasicHttpBinding_lijslwebdata\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/client&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","certificate","x509"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":12811668,"title":"WCF client error “The private key is not present in the X.509 certificate”","body":"<p>I'm stuck trying to get a WCF client to communicate to an IIS Hosted WCF Service with TransportWithMessageCredential. </p>\n\n<p>In this scenario we will have about 20 clients all running the client app. It is planned they will all use the same certificate to communicate with our server to provide encryption (identification is handled separately).
