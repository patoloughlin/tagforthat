What I'm looking for is a way to fix this. Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.DomainClasses\n//POCO classes mapped on Entity Framework.\n\n//Project/Namespace DataAccessLayer.Base\n//Base classes and interfaces for all data access layer, such as:\n\npublic abstract class BaseContext&lt;TContext&gt; : DbContext where TContext : DbContext\n{\n  //To allow multiple contexts sharing the same connection string\n  protected BaseContext(): base(\"name=MyConnectionString\") {}\n}\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; : IDisposable where T : class\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write repository\npublic interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Basic implementation for a read-only repository\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Basic implementation for a read/write repository\npublic abstract class BaseRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Project DataAccessLayer.AccountContext/ Namespace DataAccessLayer\n//Context class:\n\npublic class AccountContext : BaseContext&lt;AccountContext&gt; {}\n\n//With this, I can have simple repositories:\n\npublic class UserRepository : BaseRepository&lt;AccountContext, User&gt;\n{ //All implementation comes from the base abstract class, unless I need to change it (override methods)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a service layer between data access and the application (Windows Forms). Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services\n//Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only service working with a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class {}\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write service working with a read/write repository\npublic interface IService&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Base implementation for a read-only service\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyService&lt;T, R&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Base implementation for a read/write service\npublic abstract class BaseService&lt;T, R&gt; : IService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Concrete sample service\npublic class UserService : BaseService&lt;User, UserRepository&gt;\n{ //As with the repository I can change the default behavior of implementation overriding methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this setup, the only way to compile is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer project.\nHow can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework there?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs (DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code).</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><em>--Edit--Including here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the question--</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three (domain, base data layer and context). My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if it's really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, it's going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too? What's making VS require this?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, I'm inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.</p>\n\n<p>One possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=4.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to avoid having these references? What improvements can I have on this structure?</p>\n\n<p>What I know is that my app certainly doesn't have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. It's a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever (except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget).

The Collection property <em>is</em> editable, and it is being saved. It actually works. Once. Whenever I change something and then try to open the Form's designer again, the above error occurs again.

I need to store a collection of custom objects as part of the user's settings.  Based on lots of google work it seems that building a preferences class off of <code>ApplicationSettingsBase</code> is an appropriate way to do so.  The problem I run into is as soon as I try to store a collection of a custom type no data gets saved for that property.  If I keep to collections of base types, such as string, things work.  I have a separate proof of concept project I have been working with for the past day to isolate down to just this issue.</p>\n\n<p>This project consists of a WPF window with a listbox and two buttons, â+â and â-â.  I have a Prefs class with three properties defining different types of collections.  In my window code I bind the listbox to one of these lists and the buttons either add or remove an item to/from the list.  Closing the window should save the contents of the list to the users.config file for the current user.  Reopening it should display the saved contents of the list.</p>\n\n<p>If I use List1 (<code>ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt;</code>) and click the + button a few times then close the window the data is correctly saved to user.config.  However if I change and use List2(<code>ObservableCollection&lt;Foo&gt;</code>) or List3(<code>FooCollection</code>) I just end up with an empty value tag.  I have tried to implement <code>ISerializable</code> and <code>IXmlSerializable</code> in attempts to get this working with no change in behavior.  In fact running in debug mode with break points shows that the collection contains data when the save method is called but the serialization interface methods are never being called.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?  </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I have changed my approach and written the data off to another file alongside of user.config for the time being so that I can make some progress on other portions of the app.  But I would still like to know why application settings base was failing to record my collection data.</p>\n\n<p>Here is all of the relevent code, if someone thinks an ommitted section is important I will add it back into the post.</p>\n\n<p>user.config after adding a couple of elements to each list property</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;setting name=\"List1\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;\n        &lt;ArrayOfString xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n            xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;0&lt;/string&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;2&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;/ArrayOfString&gt;\n    &lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n&lt;setting name=\"List2\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value /&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n&lt;setting name=\"List3\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value /&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window XAML</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;\n    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n        &lt;ColumnDefinition&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;\n        &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\"&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;\n    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n    &lt;ListBox Name=\"l1\" Grid.Column=\"0\" Grid.Row=\"0\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding}\"&gt;&lt;/ListBox&gt;\n    &lt;StackPanel Grid.Column=\"1\" Grid.Row=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;Button Name=\"bP\" Margin=\"5\" Padding=\"5\" Click=\"bP_Click\"&gt;+&lt;/Button&gt;\n        &lt;Button Name=\"bM\" Margin=\"5\" Padding=\"5\" Click=\"bM_Click\"&gt;-&lt;/Button&gt;\n    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Code Behind for Window</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class Window1 : Window\n{\n    Prefs Prefs = new Prefs();\n\n    public Window1()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n\n        //l1.DataContext = Prefs.List1;\n        //l1.DataContext = Prefs.List2;\n        l1.DataContext = Prefs.List3;\n    }\n\n    private void Window_Closed(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        Prefs.Save();\n    }\n\n    private void bP_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        //Prefs.List1.Add(Prefs.List1.Count.ToString());\n        //Prefs.List2.Add(new Foo(Prefs.List2.Count.ToString()));\n        Prefs.List3.Add(new Foo(Prefs.List3.Count.ToString()));\n    }\n\n    private void bM_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        //Prefs.List1.RemoveAt(Prefs.List1.Count - 1);\n        //Prefs.List2.RemoveAt(Prefs.List2.Count - 1);\n        Prefs.List3.RemoveAt(Prefs.List3.Count - 1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Prefs class</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Prefs : ApplicationSettingsBase\n{\n    [UserScopedSettingAttribute()]\n    [DefaultSettingValueAttribute(null)]\n    public System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt;

It has the <code>Add</code> method that adds a new handler to the list and the <code>Invoke</code> method that enumerates and invokes all of the collected action handlers. The intended working scenarios include very frequent enumerations with occasional modifications while enumerating.</p>\n\n<p>Normal collections throw exception if you modify them using the <code>Add</code> method while the enumeration is not over. I've created a sample \"recursion-safe\" collection that allows adding new values even while enumerating.

After all enumerations are finished, the <code>_delta</code> values are added to the <code>_actions</code> collection. If you add some new values while the main <code>_actions</code> collection is being enumerated (creating the <code>_delta</code> collection) and then re-enter the Invoke method again we have to create a new merged collection (<code>_actions</code> + <code>_delta</code>) and replace <code>_actions</code> with it.</p>\n\n<p>So, this collection looks \"recursion-safe\", but I want to make it thread-safe.

I was thinking that it would be helpful to put a business logic layer between the application and the Linq to SQL library.  The problem is the more I design it out, the more it looks like I'm just trying to implement something that looks just like  Linq to SQL.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I decided that the application should have a single entry point to the business logic.  So that entry point (I called it MCP) has a property for class in the system, and this property has a \"list\" (probably IQueryable) that contains all the objects from the corresponding table.  Which starts sounding, and looking, a lot like a Linq to SQL data context...plus I feel like having an extra object/accessor wrapped around every existing object is a ton of extra typing just to hide the \"real\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>So because of that I'm a little afraid I'm just doing a bad re-implementation of what I already have.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip-side, I am hopefully improving on how everything works.

But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since I'd be running each link twice, that'd be a problem where POST operations were required, as it'd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API I'm consuming off a public framework, I wouldn't have control of the source code to safeguard against that.</p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions?\nIs there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do easily?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","ajax","modalpopupextender","asyncfileupload"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6328,"score":2,"question_id":1812251,"title":"how to clear the textbox value of asyncfileupload ..?","body":"<p>There is one button(MyButton).\nOnClick of this button a modalpopup(MyPopup) appears with one asyncfileupload ajax control, Ok button and Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The browse functionality of the asyncfileupload functionality is working fine, No problem.\nBut after postback, if I click the MyButton again, the popup appearing with the previous path in the asyncfileupload control's textbox.</p>\n\n<p>How to clear it ... !</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","amazon-s3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13114772,"title":"S3 .NET SDK Hash before upload?","body":"<p>When I upload a file using S3, does the SDK hash the file and make sure the current version isn't the same before it uploads?

If I remove the abstract keyword from the Payment object then the code works but I only get a collection of Payment object, I do not get their specific objects (Cash &amp; Credit Card payments).</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: How can I get AutoMapper to map the specific payment types and not the base class?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I did some more digging and think I see a problem but am not sure how I can solve this with AutoMapper. I think this is more of an EF thing and not AutoMapper's fault. :-)</p>\n\n<p>In my code I am using Entity Framework 4 Proxy POCOs with lazy loading.</p>\n\n<p>So when I try to map an entity returned from EF that is a proxy POCO it gets that funny looking type like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.CashPayment_86783D165755C316A2F58A4343EEC4842907C5539AF24F0E64AEF498B15105C2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my theory is that when AutoMapper tries to map CashPayment to DtoCashPayment and the payment passed in is of the proxy type AutoMapper sees it as a \"non match\" and then maps the generic Payment type. But since Payment is an abstract class AutoMapper bombs with a \"System.InvalidOperationException: Instances of abstract classes cannot be created.\" exception.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: Is there a way for me to use AutoMapper to map EF POCO proxy objects to Dtos.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","datetime"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":91,"score":7,"question_id":13249688,"title":"DateTime precision?","body":"<p><em>(ignoring the optimized compiler flag )</em></p>\n\n<p>can it be that this code will enter the block on some systems ? </p>\n\n<pre><code>if (Datetime.Now!=Datetime.Now)\n{\n ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I mean , how does it evaluate the values here ?

I can bind textboxes on a form like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>nameTextBox.DataBindings.Add(new Binding(\"Text\", entity, \"Name\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I did the same for a date field,</p>\n\n<pre><code>evaluationDatePicker.DataBindings.Add(new Binding(\"Value\", entity, \"EvaluationDate\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this too works fine as long as the EvaluationDate property is of type DateTime.</p>\n\n<p>However, if I now modify the entity and make EvaluationDate nullable, the binding becomes one-way. That is, the control reflects the property value (as long as it's not null), but it doesn't update the entity when I pick another date in the UI.</p>\n\n<p>In line with the recent Windows Forms policy of not throwing exceptions but rather pretend all is well even when things fail (a major annoyance in my book; Form_Load too now just swallows exceptions, though in this case of course we're way past Form_Load before the error occurs). So in fact I can't even tell if it's <em>trying</em> to do anything, but I have to assume it is, given that the two-way binding is working perfectly fine as long as the property isn't nullable.</p>\n\n<p>How can I overcome this?</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to do is write a base class for presenters in the application which has the ability to databind controls based on a simple naming convention. The presenter knows that for TextBox it should bind the Text property, for CheckBox it should bind \"Checked\", and so on. The mapping between properties and controls is done by convention - controls presenting a field should have the same name as the field plus the control type. Hence \"Name\" presented in a TextBox maps to \"NameTextBox\" (which is the convention I like to use anyway - I have never understood why people are still fond of prefixes specifically with GUI controls, but no other kind of code!?) and \"IsMarried\" in a checkbox would become \"IsMarriedCheckBox\". </p>\n\n<p>All of this allows the presenter to offer a method that accepts an object, \"datasource\", and a container where the controls to be bound are living. This makes for very rapid work adding a bunch of fields to a screen compared to having to use a bindingsource and write code, a solution which like mine does not give any compiler checks and does mean it's easy to break things by mistypes and property renames. </p>\n\n<p>But to make my little PoC I want to know what I can handle with this, and what sorts of things will still require other solutions. The whole thing would be considerably more valuable if it could support properties of nullable types, since we use them a lot. (Nor do I want to stop using them; bundling together the concept of \"has a value\" and if so \"which value\" is elegant and makes for less code, as well as more compiler help.) </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way? Anything I can hook into? Or possible to make a generic type of my own to replace Nullable&lt;T&gt;? Since I don't understand why it doesn't work without me having to do anything, it's difficult to imagine what might be worth trying to work around it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","taskbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13249511,"title":"showing the autohiding windows taskbar","body":"<p>I have defined the windows taskbar as auto-hiding.

All of those references have Copy Local set to 'True'.  Note that the code in the plugin assemblies (which are project references) is not referred to in \"ProjA\" directly, but is loaded and located through DI/Ninject.  (So I'm using these project references as a way of getting the plugin assemblies into the output folder, see below for why)</p>\n\n<p>I also have project \"ProjB\", which references ProjA.

I then think that adding the plugin assemblies as 'Content' to the project would work, but then I have two issues: 1) TFS source control; the plugin projects need a writable target to build to, presumably - content files would be 'checked in' and 2) some of the plugins have Content of their own: with references I don't need to worry about missing something.  Going the Content route I need to refer to another project's build output folder, include all of it's content, but not the PDBs.. seems even more hacky!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have also considered and played with post-build steps for either the plugin projects (not ideal: I am pulling them into this new solution from another, if I add post-build steps it will likely screw up the other solution) or the project which depends on them (which is OK, but an XCopy with relative paths, and having to manually set up Project Dependencies.. seems more hacky again).</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I'm missing, any ideas at all?

May be I'm missing something key to understanding .NET collections, but my thinking is since <code>Sort</code> acts on an existing <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, it should have lesser overhead (if every any) in processing when compared to <code>OrderBy</code> which acts on the same <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> (in our case <code>persons</code>) but have to return another collection <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb534852.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IOrderedEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. But still <code>OrderBy</code> performs far far better. <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> might have certain overhead compared to <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type, but <code>Sort</code> anyway acts on the existing list! Furthermore, I'm little amused to see a <code>Linq</code> method working faster than existing .NET method. </p>\n\n<p>All the answers in the original question compare <code>Sort</code> against <code>OrderBy.ToList</code> which I believe will have some overhead and therefore performs more or less equally. </p>\n\n<p>What could be the implementation differences?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Ok I learned something new. Here is how I confirmed about deferred execution.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    BenchMark(persons =&gt;\n    {\n        persons.Sort((p1, p2) =&gt; string.Compare(p1.Name, p2.Name, true));\n        foreach (var item in persons)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n    });\n\n    BenchMark(persons =&gt;\n    {\n        IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; people = persons.OrderBy(n =&gt; n.Name);\n        foreach (var item in people)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Sort</code> ran in 4000 - 5000ms while <code>OrderBy</code> ran just above 5000ms. So indeed my conclusion was wrong. Both of them performed on equal terms once I started to enumerate the collections. I prefer the syntax of <code>OrderBy</code> anyday :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I just found that this is exact duplicate of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10299464/why-is-array-sort-so-slow-compared-to-linq?lq=1\">this one</a>.

Trouble comes when I try to use this BrowserSession again to fetch another page. I'm doing it this way since BrowserSession saves the cookies from the last response and inserts them into the next request, thus I should not have to manually inser cookiedata fetched from my browser anymore.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I try to do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var profilePage = b.Get(@\"https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1111111111\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the doc I get back is empty.

But I'm having trouble understanding how to best handle a particular situation.  And I apologize in advance for the long explanation, but I don't know if I could be specific enough otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>The application is a general purpose record-keeping app for many different types of records, some of which are related to each other and some of which are unrelated to other records.  Each different record type we work with constitutes a distinct \"feature\" in the application.  So the startup screen for the application is essentially a switchboard from which they can select the feature they want to navigate to.  </p>\n\n<p>When they make a selection, the window (view) for that feature opens and it's from this window they can perform various operations relating to that feature.  Most of the features (e.g. Customers, Orders) have some common operations the user can perform (Creating new records, opening existing records, saving changes, printing, etc.).  Some however have operations that are specific to that one feature (e.g. a validation operation specific to the Orders feature).  My problem lies in figuring out how to perform the operations within each feature.</p>\n\n<p>Since I'm using MVP the feature window has a presenter that would respond when the user initiates any of the operations for that feature.  But since I want to follow the Single Responsibility principle I don't want the presenter to become a God class and actually know how to create records, save, print, etc.  So my thought was to define separate classes to handle each operation, as in having an ICreateOrders implementation with a .Create() method, an ISaveOrders implementation with a .Save() method, etc.  Just for the sake of having a name for them I'll call them \"resolvers\" since they actually resolve the request for that operation to happen.  Some of these common resolvers would probably have base implementations (e.g. a base FeatureSave class) because much of the code would be similar across features, but each feature needs to be able to have a specific implementation if required. This approach raises a couple of questions.</p>\n\n<p>First I want these actions to be able to be initiated from other places in the app besides just the window for that feature.  For example instead of only being able to open order records from within the Orders feature window, I'd also like to be able from the Customers feature to select \"View Orders\" and have that customer's order records opened and displayed automatically.  And to achieve code re-use I'd want to use the same IOpenOrders implementation to do the job regardless of where in the app the request was initiated from.  So simply embedding the needed resolvers in the Orders window's presenter doesn't seem like an option.</p>\n\n<p>So my thought was to create a FeatureService class that would hold a collection of Feature objects.  At app startup I'd get from the database a list of all the features that are valid for the logged-in user and I'd then iterate over that list and create a Feature object for each one and add it to the FeatureService's collection.  Then when I need to initiate an operation in one feature from another I could achieve that by just injecting the FeatureService object into the source class, getting the target feature from it, and then using that to perform the operation.  But I don't want the Feature class to be a God class either, so this would simply amount to moving all the individual resolvers from the Orders presenter to the Feature class.</p>\n\n<p>But for this to happen, the Feature object must be injected with all the resolvers it MIGHT need, without knowing if the user will perform those operations or not.  For some of the more complex features this could be 20 or 30 distinct resolvers being injected, which certainly seems like constructor injection abuse.  And while this keeps the Feature object from becoming a God class, as it's simply passing off each operation to its injected resolver, this seems wrong.  Is this correct usage when an object becomes a \"God-coordinator\" like this?</p>\n\n<p>My other question is about the volume of these objects.  For some customers there might be 50 or more separate features available (with more to follow over time no doubt).  So as I'm creating these Feature objects at startup and my container is injecting all these resolver dependencies into each one, I'm creating hundreds of objects (e.g. 40 features X 20 resolvers per feature) whether I ever access some of those features or not.  A typical user session will probably only involve going into a few features, so it seems wasteful to create so many objects at startup like this.  I could give up and just have the Feature object do ServiceLocation internally to get its resolvers, but if there's a better way, I'd like to use it.</p>\n\n<p>I can't figure out where to go from here.  I've tried to look and find examples and information on this, but I don't know if I even know enough to know what to search for.  Any guidance or insight anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wcf","c#-4.0","versioning"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13073339,"title":"WCF 4.5 Versioning","body":"<p>I have a WCF service with a data contract and etc...</p>\n\n<p>I need to make some changes in the contract, because some customers I had to change the business logic and add two data members in the data contract.

This causes a query where the result will contain the already changed entity object (because it is attached to the DbContext before the actual query is sent to the database).</p>\n\n<p><strong>And here is my problem: At this point the entity framework could compare the ROW_VERSION of the attached object with that of the object in the actual query result, detect a mismatch and e.g. throw an exception.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But instead the EF treats the ROW_VERSION property like all other properties which could just have been changed by the client.</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I wish the EF to treat the ROW_VERSION property specially and compare its values on every query to detect changes by other clients.

From there, I need to scan through all the rows to build a string:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           foreach (myDataTableRow row in _dt)\n            {\n                sbFilter.Append(\"'\" + row.info + \"',\");\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that upon doing this after a delete, the following exception is thrown:\n<code>DeletedRowInaccessibleException: Deleted row information cannot be accessed through the row.</code></p>\n\n<p>The work around that I am currently using (which feels like a hack) is the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           foreach (myDataTableRow  row in _dt)\n            {\n                if (row.RowState != DataRowState.Deleted &amp;&amp;\n                    row.RowState != DataRowState.Detached)\n                {\n                    sbFilter.Append(\"'\" + row.info + \"',\");\n                }\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question:  Is this the proper way to do this?  Why would the foreach loop access rows that have been tagged via the <code>Delete()</code> method??</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","visual-studio-2010","c#-4.0"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13209125,"title":"what is use of base.OnManipulationStarted(e) in OnManipulationStarted(ManipulationStartedEventArgs e) in C# .Net?","body":"<p>I created a program which uses  </p>\n\n<pre><code>OnManipulationStarted(ManipulationStartedEventArgs e) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then I found </p>\n\n<pre><code>base.OnManipulationStarted(e) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which was automatically inserted in the code....I have commented that line and checked the program which gave no change in output of program..For what reason does this code exist in the default method ??</p>\n\n<pre><code>OnManipulationStarted(ManipulationStartedEventArgs e) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help please...Thanks in Advance.. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","magento","shopping-cart"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":723,"score":3,"question_id":8531659,"title":"best .net solution for ecommerce compared to Magento CE","body":"<p>I am in the need of looking for a .net shopping cart, I am a .net developer not PHP and I need that the shopping cart solution be extendible.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I have used Magento, and its probably the best solution out there, but I dont want just to learn another programming language.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any as good as magento but done in .NET??</p>\n\n<p>Some requirements I need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MultiStore in one single database.</li>\n<li>Ability to create themes.</li>\n<li>Complex shopping cart discount rules as in Magento</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wpf","observablecollection","inotifypropertychanged"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":2,"question_id":13203795,"title":"Binding multiple ObservableCollections to One ObservableCollection","body":"<p>Have a bunch of <code>ObservableCollection&lt;MeClass&gt; Result</code> and require to combine them all into another <code>ObservableCollection&lt;MeClass&gt; AllResults</code> so I can display it in a <code>listview</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Just not sure how to combine them all in one.</p>\n\n<p>I Created a new class to combine them all but not sure how they will get updated after I got the list once...

Client connections are long-lived - typically hours. (The server is part of a trading system. The client messages are aggregated into groups to send to an exchange over a smaller number of 'outbound' socket connections, and acknowledgment messages are sent back to the clients as each group is processed by the exchange.) OS is Windows Server 2003, hardware is 2 x 4-core X5355. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Current client socket design:</strong> A <code>TcpListener</code> spawns a thread to read each client socket as clients connect. The threads block on <code>Socket.Receive</code>, parsing incoming messages and inserting them into a set of queues for processing by the core server logic. Acknowledgment messages are sent back out over the client sockets using async <code>Socket.BeginSend</code> calls from the threads that talk to the exchange side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Observed problems:</strong> As the client count has grown (now 60-70), we have started to see intermittent delays of up to 100s of milliseconds while sending and receiving data to/from the clients. (We log timestamps for each acknowledgment message, and we can see occasional long gaps in the timestamp sequence for bunches of acks from the same group that normally go out in a few ms total.) </p>\n\n<p>Overall system CPU usage is low (&lt; 10%), there is plenty of free RAM, and the core logic and the outbound (exchange-facing) side are performing fine, so the problem seems to be isolated to the client-facing socket code. There is ample network bandwidth between the server and clients (gigabit LAN), and we have ruled out network or hardware-layer problems.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions or pointers to useful resources would be greatly appreciated.

(One can use a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1346480/how-to-make-a-net-application-large-address-aware\">hack</a> to turn on the large address aware flag but MarkH's answer shows that checks inside the .NET Framework will break things because the address space is assumed to be only 2GB, not 3GB.)</p>\n\n<p>This means that all correct virtual memory addresses a pointer can have (as far as the .NET Framework is concerned) will be between 0x00000000 and 0x7FFFFFFF. When this range is translated to signed <code>int</code>, no values would be negative because the highest bit is not set. This reinforces my belief that there's no difference in using IntPtr vs UIntPtr. Is my reasoning correct?</strike></p>\n\n<p>Fermat2357 pointed out that the above edit is wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","console-application","exit-code"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":0,"question_id":13195491,"title":"How do I make my console application return an integer?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155610/how-do-i-specify-the-exit-code-of-a-console-application-in-net\">How do I specify the exit code of a console application in .net?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to have a console app that returns a value to the caller (I will call it by a PowerShell script).</p>\n\n<p>How can I change the entry-point to the console app?

First I have a <code>BaseController</code> that sets a <code>ViewBag</code> property listing all of the possible categories:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        _connection.Open();\n        this.ViewBag.AvailableCategories = new MultiSelectList(_connection.Query&lt;Category&gt;(\"select * from Category\"), \"CategoryID\", \"Name\");\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        throw new HttpException(500, ex.Message);\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        _connection.Close();\n    }\n\n    base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, when navigating to <code>/Event/View/1</code> I have the <code>EventController</code> setup (<strong>NOTE</strong> this controller bases the aforementioned controller) with the following <code>View</code> method.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ActionResult View(int id)\n{\n    Event evt = null;\n\n    try\n    {\n        evt = Event.Where(_connection, id);\n        if (evt == null)\n        {\n            throw new HttpException(404, \"Oops!

However, I'm running into a problem when trying to set up the main windows service engines, which need to establish connections to the RabbitMQ server to do their thing.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the <code>ConnectionFactory</code> object in RabbitMQ's .NET client is not abstract and implements no interfaces.  I can't see an obvious way to inject this class using an IoC container like StructureMap.  Even the code examples in the documentation show just blatantly <code>new</code>ing it up, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code> ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();\n factory.Uri = \"amqp://user:pass@hostName:port/vhost\";\n IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The solution that presents itself to me is to push up the entire factory into the service's main <code>OnStart</code> and <code>OnStop</code> functions, which are really difficult to test and not of huge interest anyway.  However, that leaves me with a single <code>IConnection</code> for the service, so if that connection is broken in any way, the service has no way to recover and must simply exit.  If the main engine had visibility to the factory, it could simply produce a new connection and continue.  But unless I inject that, there is no way to test the main engine without connecting to an existing server!</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything I am missing here?  Any other option I'm not considering?  How can I go about injecting this factory, and if I can't, how can I limit the damage?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also, as an afterthought, I'm perfectly happy to make a change to RabbitMQ's .NET client to implement an interface on this if someone has a good idea of how receptive the main dev team would be to a change like this.  I'd be delighted to contribute, but the last thing I want to do is have my programs working on some custom version of RabbitMQ, thereby eliminating the main benefit of using a third party library in the first place.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","mysql","vb.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13194056,"title":"Delegate Error when converting C# to VBNET","body":"<p>I have this code in c#</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Backup()\n{\n    string constr = \"server=localhost;user=root;pwd=qwerty;database=test;\";\n    string file = \"C:\\\\MyDumpFile.sql\";\n    MySqlBackup mb = new MySqlBackup(constr);\n    mb.ExportInfo.FileName = file;\n    mb.ExportProgressChanged += new MySqlBackup.exportProgressChange(mb_ExportProgressChanged);\n    mb.ExportCompleted += new MySqlBackup.exportComplete(mb_ExportCompleted);\n    timerRead.Start();\n    mb.Export();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when converted to <code>VBNet</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub Backup()\n    Dim constr As String = \"server=localhost;user=root;pwd=qwerty;database=test;\"\n    Dim file As String = \"C:\\MyDumpFile.sql\"\n    Dim mb As New MySqlBackup(constr)\n    mb.ExportInfo.FileName = file\n    mb.ExportProgressChanged = mb.ExportProgressChanged + New MySqlBackup.exportProgressChange(mb_ExportProgressChanged)\n    mb.ExportCompleted = mb.ExportCompleted + New MySqlBackup.exportComplete(mb_ExportCompleted)\n    timerRead.Start()\n    mb.Export()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I always get this error</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'exportProgressChange' is a type in\n  'MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlBackup' and cannot be used as an\n  expression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","configuration"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13194039,"title":"How to test the transformed web.config on localhost?","body":"<p>I have a classic development architecture : </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3 different Server </li>\n<li>3 different DB :</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>=> A distinct couple for each  Dev, Test &amp; Prod</p>\n\n<p>Each config has thus its own connection string.\nThe Web.config has 3 transformation available, one for each config.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that the transformation of the web.config doesn't seems to occur on localhost...</p>\n\n<p>If it's true, How can I have the right (transformed) web.config corresponding to my chosen config on localhost?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","localization","cultureinfo","culture"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13193603,"title":"culture locale make up","body":"<p>The following is the culture locale for Belgium with the french language: fr-BE</p>\n\n<p>fr is the Two Letter ISO Language Name</p>\n\n<p>But what is the correct term/name for the \"BE\" aspect of the culture local?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","webbrowser-control"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9517,"score":12,"question_id":2476360,"title":"Disable JavaScript error in WebBrowser control","body":"<p>I am developing a windows application with a WebBrowser control that navigates to a sharepoint site.<br>\nMy problem is that i am getting JavaScript error.</p>\n\n<p>How can i disable the JavaScript error?
