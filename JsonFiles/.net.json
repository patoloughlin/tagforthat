The company utilizes automated trading algorithms which process streaming quotes and send out quotes for hundreds of products dozens of times per second. Obviously, performance is a significant concern. (Which makes me question why we're using VB.NET, but that's another topic entirely.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm relatively new to the company and am working with another guy on some code that's been around for a while. This code utilizes a Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection object to store all of the products (objects representing pairs of ETFs or stocks and a large amount of data about each) and does a LOT of searching/retrieving from that Collection.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, the Collection class is deprecated and pretty much no one uses it anymore. In our more recent code we've been using .NET collections such as List(Of T) and Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue) and from what I understand it might make sense to replace the old Collection with a Dictionary. However, as the source code is quite substantial, going ahead with this replacement would be a significant undertaking; and so my question is just this:</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone actually measured the performance difference between the old Collection and a .NET Dictionary? Is such a comparison, for whatever reason, inappropriate? It certainly seems that everything we are currently doing with the Collection we could do with a Dictionary; basically I just want to know if it makes sense for us to go through the code and make this transition, or if doing so would essentially be a waste.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Originally in the question I referred to the current Collection we are using as a VB6 Collection. After reading the first two answers I realize it is more accurately a Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection, which appears to be a class introduced for compatibility between VB6 and VB.NET. I think the question still holds.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the first link provided in Kenneth Cochran's answer, I am led to believe that a Dictionary would indeed be better suited to our purposes than a Collection as it performs better at retrieving items by key and running \"For Each\" loops by several milliseconds for 10,000 runs. At our company, this is a realistic scenario; there are lots of places in the code with statements like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim ETF as ETFdetails = ETFcoll(sym)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And as I said, these lines execute on hundreds of products, many times per second. With this in mind I am inclined to think we really should go ahead and make the change, then measure any performance difference. I expect that we will see at least a mild but noticeable improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything obviously wrong with what I've just said? If so, point it out!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net",".net",".net-3.5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13293346,"title":"User Defined controls on web form","body":"<p>Using VS 2010, C#, .NET 3.5</p>\n\n<p>I have three User Defined Web Controls:</p>\n\n<p>Control 1 has a ListBox and A Button</p>\n\n<p>Control 2 has three <code>Text-Boxes</code> two <code>DropDownLists</code> and three <code>Buttons</code></p>\n\n<p>Control 3 has only a Table which is populated in code.</p>\n\n<p>I have two pages:</p>\n\n<p>Page 1 has Control 2 and Control 3</p>\n\n<p>Page 2 has Control 1, Control 2, and Control 3</p>\n\n<p>Functionality of Control 2 works perfectly on Page 1.</p>\n\n<p>However, on Page 2 when the submit button is clicked, both DropDownLists ALWAYS show <code>SelectedIndex = 0</code> and <code>SelectedValue = \"0\"</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All three Text Boxes and Buttons retain their value on both pages when the Submit Button on Control 2 is clicked.

I've also seen some articles online that suggest Digest Authentication is fundamentally flawed, but according to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee817643.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Authentication in ASP.NET: .NET Security Guidance</a>, I shouldn't use Basic Authentication if my users are stored in a custom database. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So let me lay out a simpler scenario that will hopefully be easier to answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to implement custom authentication used when mapping a network drive to a virtual directory in my site. I'm using IIS 7.5. I need to parse out the username and password to handle the custom log-in, either in an <code>HttpModule</code> or a Global.asax event. Has anyone ever done anything like this or have any advice/suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>I've found <a href=\"http://blog.smithfamily.dk/2008/08/27/ImplementingBasicAuthenticationInASPNET20.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this example which seems like it could work</a> - but it's meant for a browser. I've got it implemented now on my test site but the problem is when mapping the drive, the 401 challenge is returned (which is supposed to prompt for a log-in) but Windows instead displays an error that says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Windows cannot access <code>Http://myServer/mySite/myFolder</code></p>\n  \n  <p>Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your\n  network.</p>\n  \n  <p>Error code: 0x80070043 The network name cannot be found</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if I can format/build a Basic/Digest Authentication-style challenge response so that Windows will prompt for a log-in rather than displaying the network can't be found? Does anyone know if this is possible?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I saw using Fiddler, that Windows Authentication includes a <code>Negotiate</code> header. So I tried including that header in my challenge response in addition to the <code>WWW-Authenticate: Basic</code> header. This seems to have fixed my problem with the \"network name cannot be found\" error described above, but unfortunately now there is no Authorization header included in the subsequent request (after I provide my credentials) so I can't pull out the username and password.</p>\n\n<p>I'm running out of ideas here, and while there seems to be a lot of documentation on Authentication, there doesn't seem to be much on WebDAV Authentication (or how to use it), or custom authentication when mapping drives. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any insight or ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's not looking like I'll be able to do what I want exactly. I'm going to do further testing with @AdamV 's suggestion with Windows Authentication as it looks like it might be my only option.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","string","truncate"],"answer_count":9,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":34,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5841,"score":34,"question_id":2776673,"title":"How do I truncate a .NET string?","body":"<p>I apologize for such a question that likely has a trivial solution, but strangely, I could not find a concise API for this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, I would like to truncate a string such that its length is not longer than a given value.

The column is hosting a third-party component. I enter edit mode in the cell and modify its value and then I press enter key to validate the value. The problem is that I have to press enter key twice to validate the value. It seems like first enter key is to validate the value in the third-party's editor hosted in the cell, and second one to validate the <code>DataGridView</code>'s cell... So how to validate cell's value with only pressing enter key one time? </p>\n\n<p>Also I have seen strange behaviour, for example, the last <code>DataGridView</code>'s row does not behaves as the rest of the <code>DataGridView</code>'s cells. For last row, if I edit the value of a cell and then press enter key to validate, after validating value, it always remains in the same cell and in edit mode and cell's value gets selected so user can think that cell value is invalid when in fact it isn't.

How to do this? Also I have tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.dataGridView.CurrentCell.DataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this.dataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);</p>\n\n<p>in DataError handler but it does not work.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, cellvaluechanged is not raised maybe as it is a hosted control in the cell...I don't understand why I have to press enter key twice to commit and validate changes on the cell and exit edit mode for the cell. I want only to press enter key press once.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php",".net","ssl","curl","basic-authentication"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13287469,"title":"PHP CURL and ssl authentication basic","body":"<p>I like to get content of file protected with authentication basic and ssl , using this code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n $ch=curl_init();\n curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,'https://webservicexxx.com:60443/services.asmx?WSDL');\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, \"MYLOGIN:MYPASSWORD\");\n curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);   // no verify\n curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,5);\n curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);\n $buffer = curl_exec($ch);\n curl_close($ch);\n\n print $buffer;\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But in the result, on my screen i haven't the content of the file that i woulk like to get, but i have this page :</p>\n\n<pre><code>Erreur HTTP 401.2 - Non autorisé : Accès refusé en raison de la configuration du serveur.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That means, that the authentication doesn't work.

I want to be able to look at the Tag of the TextBox and iterate through the entire Company object to find a property with a matching Name and Set its value to the Text property of the TextBox.

As I'm sure you well can guess my class is a GREAT deal larger than the example provided with near 100 properties. Most all are string values which will be entered in manually through TextBox objects. I'm attempting to create one routine that can then be called by all TextBox objects whereby the Tag property of the object could be used to indicate which Property of my class I'm trying to set.

(Stopped|Running|Paused|StopPending|StartPending|PausePending|ContinuePending)","body":"<p>I am developing a Windows Service application of some complexity, and need to have a way of gracefully transitioning between states. Since each state might need initialization / cleaning up, there must be a mechanism that coordinates the transitions between them and makes sure only valid states can be reached from any given state. The states in question are the familiar states of a Windows Service:</p>\n\n<p><code>Stopped|Running|Paused|StopPending|StartPending|PausePending|ContinuePending</code></p>\n\n<p>I have developed a system that <i>seems</i> to do this properly, but I am curious whether it has flaws that I just haven't stumbled over yet and/or if there are more tried-and-tested patterns / best practices that I could or should use instead.</p>\n\n<p>This is implemented in a Bootstrapper class that exposes methods corresponding to the commands I should expect from a Windows Service: Start, Stop, Pause, Continue (so that the Service's OnStart command will simply call the class' Start method, OnStop will call Stop etc):</p>\n\n<p>In the Service code (this is VB.Net, but I had to use // for comments here, since ' seemed to mess things up in the code listing):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sub OnStart()\n    Bootstrapper.Start()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the <code>Start()</code> method of my class (I bypass threading and exception handling and other logic for simplicity here):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Sub Start()\n    If RequestState(State.Running) = True Then\n        // Log success\n    Else\n        // Log failure\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, inside my class, there is a similar set of private <code>OnStart()</code>, <code>OnStop()</code>, <code>OnPause()</code> and <code>OnContinue()</code> methods that perform the actual initialization / cleanup for each state:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Function OnStart() As Boolean\n    SetState(State.StartPending)\n        // Do something\n    Return SetState(State.Running)\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see above, there are calls being made to two other methods - <code>RequestState()</code> and <code>SetState()</code>. That's where the logic actually takes place, and it works as follows:</p>\n\n<p>A command is being sent to the application (Start, Stop, Pause or Continue).

For example: \"Welcome to the CompanyX web portal\" or \"Contact CompanyX support for more info\".\nNow we want to deploy an instance of this application for Company Y instead. So we want a good way to dynamically replace the company name in all the resources. \nWe think that a workable way to achieve this, is to replace CompanyX with a named placeholder like $COMPANYNAME$ in all the resX files (simple find-replace). \nThen, at runtime, replace that placeholder with the actual company name, which is unique per physical deployment and defined in the settings.</p>\n\n<p>The place where we could do that dynamic replacement could be a custom implementation of IResourceProvider. After a string is looked up we could run our custom replacement logic on it.\nThe \"GetObject\" method seems wel suited for this task. Apart from this little hook, our custom implementation should look up local and global resources EXACTLY the same way as the default ResourceProvider, which suits our needs fine.\nHowever, I failed to find the source of the default ResourceProvider online. I only find examples of highly customized IResourceProvider implementations (e.g. that use the db). </p>\n\n<p>First question:\nIs this a decent approach to solving the main problem (replacing the company name in our resource strings? \nThe BIG advantage with this approach is that we wouldn't need to modify the aspx markup or code that uses the resources. We don't want to wrap every reference to a resource with a custom function call to do the placeholder formatting.\nAlso, just duplicating the resx files and doing find-replace is not option. We want to limit the number of files and strings to maintain!\nIf we can get the same advantages with another approach, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Second question:\nCan someone show me how to implement this concept without disturbing the default handling of global and local resources? All I need is a way to hook in somewhere after the value is loaded, and execute the replacement logic.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","aforge"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13284586,"title":"How to use window in FFT","body":"<p>I dont understand how to use the window in FFT.

to avoid the need to reference Entity Framework on my service layer?","body":"<p>While trying to create a data access layer for a new project, I ran into what I can only imagine as an OOP/Design/Generics problem (using EF 4.3 to access the database).</p>\n\n<p>Mainly I wanted to achieve two things with this data layer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Different Context objects I have on my project should share the same connection string.</li>\n<li>Abstract repository class with common implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For some reason, I cannot compile my solution without referencing EntityFramework on the service layer. What I'm looking for is a way to fix this. Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.DomainClasses\n//POCO classes mapped on Entity Framework.\n\n//Project/Namespace DataAccessLayer.Base\n//Base classes and interfaces for all data access layer, such as:\n\npublic abstract class BaseContext&lt;TContext&gt; : DbContext where TContext : DbContext\n{\n  //To allow multiple contexts sharing the same connection string\n  protected BaseContext(): base(\"name=MyConnectionString\") {}\n}\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; : IDisposable where T : class\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write repository\npublic interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Basic implementation for a read-only repository\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Basic implementation for a read/write repository\npublic abstract class BaseRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Project DataAccessLayer.AccountContext/ Namespace DataAccessLayer\n//Context class:\n\npublic class AccountContext : BaseContext&lt;AccountContext&gt; {}\n\n//With this, I can have simple repositories:\n\npublic class UserRepository : BaseRepository&lt;AccountContext, User&gt;\n{ //All implementation comes from the base abstract class, unless I need to change it (override methods)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a service layer between data access and the application (Windows Forms). Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services\n//Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only service working with a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class {}\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write service working with a read/write repository\npublic interface IService&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Base implementation for a read-only service\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyService&lt;T, R&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Base implementation for a read/write service\npublic abstract class BaseService&lt;T, R&gt; : IService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Concrete sample service\npublic class UserService : BaseService&lt;User, UserRepository&gt;\n{ //As with the repository I can change the default behavior of implementation overriding methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this setup, the only way to compile is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer project.\nHow can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework there?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs (DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code).</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><em>--Edit--Including here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the question--</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three (domain, base data layer and context). My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if it's really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, it's going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too? What's making VS require this?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, I'm inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.</p>\n\n<p>One possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=4.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to avoid having these references? What improvements can I have on this structure?</p>\n\n<p>What I know is that my app certainly doesn't have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. It's a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever (except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget).

Removing the resx file \"solves\" that exactly once.</p>\n\n<p>The Form can now be displayed again, with my <code>UserControl1</code>. The Collection property <em>is</em> editable, and it is being saved. It actually works. Once. Whenever I change something and then try to open the Form's designer again, the above error occurs again.

I have code that instantiates a class generated from the script, which has a constructor taking parameters, of which some are types from the dynamically emitted assembly.

This occurs because they both have the same name and location.  The question: how do I get the CSharpCodeProvider to resolve to the latest version of the dynamic assembly?</p>\n\n<p>I've considered changing the location for each dynamically emitted assembly, but I'd prefer not to create a bunch of copies on disk for each script iteration.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":13274113,"title":"Variables that accept values with pipe | as separator","body":"<p>I have six variables of type <code>String</code>, they contain 0/1 value retrieved from a DB field bit.</p>\n\n<p>So,these variables are value of radio boxes, that have Y=1 | N=0. </p>\n\n<p>Now,  I have a Varilable,  that accept one or more enumerator values, they are separated by pipe \"|\".</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (bool.Parse(mht_ReadAccess) &amp;&amp; bool.Parse(mht_WriteAccess))\n{\n  var grantAccessRequest = new GrantAccessRequest\n  {\n    PrincipalAccess = new PrincipalAccess\n    {\n      AccessMask = AccessRights.WriteAccess | AccessRights.ReadAccess,\n      Principal = userreference\n    },\n    Target = recordentityreference\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this is a static way to solve this problem.

I need to store a collection of custom objects as part of the user's settings.  Based on lots of google work it seems that building a preferences class off of <code>ApplicationSettingsBase</code> is an appropriate way to do so.  The problem I run into is as soon as I try to store a collection of a custom type no data gets saved for that property.  If I keep to collections of base types, such as string, things work.  I have a separate proof of concept project I have been working with for the past day to isolate down to just this issue.</p>\n\n<p>This project consists of a WPF window with a listbox and two buttons, “+” and “-“.  I have a Prefs class with three properties defining different types of collections.  In my window code I bind the listbox to one of these lists and the buttons either add or remove an item to/from the list.  Closing the window should save the contents of the list to the users.config file for the current user.  Reopening it should display the saved contents of the list.</p>\n\n<p>If I use List1 (<code>ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt;</code>) and click the + button a few times then close the window the data is correctly saved to user.config.  However if I change and use List2(<code>ObservableCollection&lt;Foo&gt;</code>) or List3(<code>FooCollection</code>) I just end up with an empty value tag.  I have tried to implement <code>ISerializable</code> and <code>IXmlSerializable</code> in attempts to get this working with no change in behavior.  In fact running in debug mode with break points shows that the collection contains data when the save method is called but the serialization interface methods are never being called.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?  </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I have changed my approach and written the data off to another file alongside of user.config for the time being so that I can make some progress on other portions of the app.  But I would still like to know why application settings base was failing to record my collection data.</p>\n\n<p>Here is all of the relevent code, if someone thinks an ommitted section is important I will add it back into the post.</p>\n\n<p>user.config after adding a couple of elements to each list property</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;setting name=\"List1\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;\n        &lt;ArrayOfString xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n            xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;0&lt;/string&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;2&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;/ArrayOfString&gt;\n    &lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n&lt;setting name=\"List2\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value /&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n&lt;setting name=\"List3\" serializeAs=\"Xml\"&gt;\n    &lt;value /&gt;\n&lt;/setting&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window XAML</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;\n    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n        &lt;ColumnDefinition&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;\n        &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\"&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;\n    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n    &lt;ListBox Name=\"l1\" Grid.Column=\"0\" Grid.Row=\"0\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding}\"&gt;&lt;/ListBox&gt;\n    &lt;StackPanel Grid.Column=\"1\" Grid.Row=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;Button Name=\"bP\" Margin=\"5\" Padding=\"5\" Click=\"bP_Click\"&gt;+&lt;/Button&gt;\n        &lt;Button Name=\"bM\" Margin=\"5\" Padding=\"5\" Click=\"bM_Click\"&gt;-&lt;/Button&gt;\n    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Code Behind for Window</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class Window1 : Window\n{\n    Prefs Prefs = new Prefs();\n\n    public Window1()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n\n        //l1.DataContext = Prefs.List1;\n        //l1.DataContext = Prefs.List2;\n        l1.DataContext = Prefs.List3;\n    }\n\n    private void Window_Closed(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        Prefs.Save();\n    }\n\n    private void bP_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        //Prefs.List1.Add(Prefs.List1.Count.ToString());\n        //Prefs.List2.Add(new Foo(Prefs.List2.Count.ToString()));\n        Prefs.List3.Add(new Foo(Prefs.List3.Count.ToString()));\n    }\n\n    private void bM_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        //Prefs.List1.RemoveAt(Prefs.List1.Count - 1);\n        //Prefs.List2.RemoveAt(Prefs.List2.Count - 1);\n        Prefs.List3.RemoveAt(Prefs.List3.Count - 1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Prefs class</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Prefs : ApplicationSettingsBase\n{\n    [UserScopedSettingAttribute()]\n    [DefaultSettingValueAttribute(null)]\n    public System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt;

Here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Media_Audio aud = (Media_Audio)item.MediaFile;\nTimeSpan total = aud.EndTime - aud.StartTime;\nif (aud.EndTime.TotalSeconds == 0)\n{\n    total = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(aud.Player.Duration)-aud.StartTime;\n}\nTimeSpan now = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(aud.Player.CurrentPosition) - aud.StartTime;\nstring nows = now.Hours.ToString() + \":\" + now.Minutes.ToString() + \":\" + now.Seconds.ToString();\nstring tots = total.Hours.ToString() + \":\" + total.Minutes.ToString() + \":\" + total.Seconds.ToString();\nitem.currentPosition.Text = nows + \"/\" + tots;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The key line being:</p>\n\n<pre><code>total = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(aud.Player.Duration)-aud.StartTime;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>aud.Player is an instance of Microsoft.DirectX.AudioVideoPlayback.Audio.</p>\n\n<p>For a song that is, in fact, 5:49 seconds long, it reports 39:13 as the duration. The same length as Windows Explorer and VLC Player. Also, have the K-Lite Mega Codec pack installed. so it could be interfering. I am aware of this question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383164/how-to-retrieve-duration-of-mp3-in-net\">How to retrieve duration of MP3 in .NET?</a>\nHowever, at this stage in my program I do not have the time to switch from my current method of playing audio files to a new one, so do I have any other options to determine the duration using DirectX only?

This helps me splitting the code, managing the different parts of the program. And it would be easy to expand the application later on.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create a class where I manage the active controls I want to call one function in that class with as argument the form that should become active.</p>\n\n<p>An image can illustrate how I try to setup this application. <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jwimk.png\" alt=\"Illustration\"> Note that the control manager class is not a seperate class in the code i show below, but a partial class of the mainform. Any tips on how to get it like in the image are very welcome :)</p>\n\n<p>The class to manage all active forms looks like this: Please note that all user controls are just a user control with some buttons/textboxes etc on it. No code is added at all yet.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public partial class STP2Main \n        {\n// I make each UserControl accessable for the whole class\n            SetupDeviceControl.SetupDevice SetupDev = new SetupDeviceControl.SetupDevice();\n            GenConfigFileControl.GenConfigFileControl GenConfFile = new GenConfigFileControl.GenConfigFileControl();\n            Monitoring.MonitoringControl Monitor = new Monitoring.MonitoringControl();\n            GenEncKeyControl.GenEncKeyControl GenEncKey = new GenEncKeyControl.GenEncKeyControl();\n            MenuControl.MenuControl MenuControl = new MenuControl.MenuControl();        \n\n            public void SelectActiveWindow()\n            {\n                // Any active control should be hidden thats what this function does:\n                HideCurrentActiveControl();\n                // Check whether the window is already created\n                if (!WindowExists())\n                { // if not created; create the windows: \n                    switch (STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.NextActiveControl)\n                    {\n                        case STP_Data.Data.SetupDeviceControl: // control 1:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.SetupDeviceControl;\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.SetupDeviceControlIsCreated = true;\n                            SetupDev.Parent = this;\n                            SetupDev.Location = new Point(3, 30);\n                            SetupDev.Show();\n                            SetupDev.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                        case STP_Data.Data.MonitoringControl: //control 2:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.MonitoringControl;\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.MonitoringControlIsCreated = true;\n                            Monitor.Parent = this;\n                            Monitor.Location = new Point(3, 125);\n                            Monitor.Show();\n                            Monitor.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                        case STP_Data.Data.MenuControl: // control 3\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.MenuControl;\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.MenuControlIsCreated = true;  \n                            MenuControl.Location = new Point(3, 30);\n                            MenuControl.Parent = this;\n                            MenuControl.Show();\n                            MenuControl.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                    }\n                }\n                else\n                { // window is already created so needs to be called to front again:\n                    switch (STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.NextActiveControl)\n                    {\n                        case STP_Data.Data.SetupDeviceControl:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.SetupDeviceControl;\n                            SetupDev.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                        case STP_Data.Data.MonitoringControl:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.MonitoringControl;\n                            Monitor.Visible = true;\n                            Monitor.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                        case STP_Data.Data.AdvancedMenu:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.AdvancedMenu;\n                            tabControl1.Visible = true;\n                            tabControl1.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n\n                        case STP_Data.Data.MenuControl:\n                            STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl = STP_Data.Data.MenuControl;\n                            MenuControl.Visible = true;\n                            MenuControl.BringToFront();\n                            break;\n                    }\n\n                }\n                btnMenu.BringToFront();\n\n            }\n    // some functions which are called above are not shown; not relevant for this question\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I experience is the following: I get no errors at all. But the controls simply not change at all. If I call a window, it is created only once, because I did make it as partial class of my Mainform. (I've tried a complete seperate class, which did result in errors with threading, As I am not an experienced c# programmer, I tried to avoid that using a partial class.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll add another function; which does not do anything at all: </p>\n\n<pre><code>    private void HideCurrentActiveControl()\n    {\n        switch (STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.CurrentActiveControl)\n        {\n            case STP_Data.Data.SetupDeviceControl:\n                SetupDev.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            case STP_Data.Data.MonitoringControl:\n                tabControl1.Visible = false;\n                Monitor.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            case STP_Data.Data.GenConfFileControl:\n                GenConfFile.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            case STP_Data.Data.GenEncKeyControl:\n                GenEncKey.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            case STP_Data.Data.MenuControl:\n                MenuControl.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            case STP_Data.Data.AdvancedMenu:\n                tabControl1.Visible = false;\n                break;\n            default:\n                tabControl1.Visible = false;\n                break;\n\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried debugging this part of code and it executes the statements, but I see no changes at all.</p>\n\n<p>I think I've shown what I am trying to do; and how I try to do that. My question is: How do I acces those forms so I can manage them from a seperate class (or in this case partial class of the main form).</p>\n\n<p>Then I have this last function, which does some wierd things. Before I call the SelectActiveWindow() function I update the variable STP_Design.ProgramParameters.C.NextActiveControl to for example:  ...AdvancedMenu.

I was thinking that it would be helpful to put a business logic layer between the application and the Linq to SQL library.  The problem is the more I design it out, the more it looks like I'm just trying to implement something that looks just like  Linq to SQL.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I decided that the application should have a single entry point to the business logic.  So that entry point (I called it MCP) has a property for class in the system, and this property has a \"list\" (probably IQueryable) that contains all the objects from the corresponding table.  Which starts sounding, and looking, a lot like a Linq to SQL data context...plus I feel like having an extra object/accessor wrapped around every existing object is a ton of extra typing just to hide the \"real\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>So because of that I'm a little afraid I'm just doing a bad re-implementation of what I already have.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip-side, I am hopefully improving on how everything works.

Users can have multiple versions of the application running side by side on their computer.  </p>\n\n<p>My single WPF application is supposed to allow users to select the version of this other application they would like to work with. The other application has an unmanaged COM DLL for each version installed that I use to create the integration between my WPF app and this other application.</p>\n\n<p>My WPF application has been working fine with the first version of the other application using a reference to the unmanaged COM component of version 1. The trouble starts when I try to reference the COM component of the second version. </p>\n\n<p>I get the following error when I use “Add Reference” on the WPF project:\n<em>A reference to 'XXX Type Library' could not be added.

The ProgID and the TypeLib values are the same across both components.  </p>\n\n<p>As the versions of the other application are really treated as separate applications I would prefer the COM components to be installed as different applications and I’m working with company on the next release.</p>\n\n<p>For now I’m stuck trying to get version 2 integrated into my WPF application. I’ve seen many posts about  <em>extern alias</em> and how to manually edit the project file to introduce aliases, but they all seem to start with managed assemblies and not unmanaged COM components. The contents of the project file are different for referenced unmanaged COM components and as I can’t create the second reference, adding an <em>aliases</em> tag to the references in the project files doesn’t help me. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve seen people talking about using System.Addin and reflection but I wanted to confirm there isn’t a more straightforward approach before investigating more complex approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this far!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Following CasperOne's advise I did the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ran the following using Visual Studio Command Prompt: <em>tlbimp \"c:\\xxx1.dll\" /out:\"c:\\NETxxx1.dll\"</em></li>\n<li>Ran the following using Visual Studio Command Prompt: <em>tlbimp \"c:\\xxx2.dll\" /out:\"c:\\NETxxx2.dll\"</em></li>\n<li>Added both newly created DLLs (Interop's I guess) as references to my test project.

But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since I'd be running each link twice, that'd be a problem where POST operations were required, as it'd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API I'm consuming off a public framework, I wouldn't have control of the source code to safeguard against that.</p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions?\nIs there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do easily?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","ajax","modalpopupextender","asyncfileupload"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6335,"score":2,"question_id":1812251,"title":"how to clear the textbox value of asyncfileupload ..?","body":"<p>There is one button(MyButton).\nOnClick of this button a modalpopup(MyPopup) appears with one asyncfileupload ajax control, Ok button and Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The browse functionality of the asyncfileupload functionality is working fine, No problem.\nBut after postback, if I click the MyButton again, the popup appearing with the previous path in the asyncfileupload control's textbox.</p>\n\n<p>How to clear it ... !</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","amazon-s3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13114772,"title":"S3 .NET SDK Hash before upload?","body":"<p>When I upload a file using S3, does the SDK hash the file and make sure the current version isn't the same before it uploads?

So in fact I can't even tell if it's <em>trying</em> to do anything, but I have to assume it is, given that the two-way binding is working perfectly fine as long as the property isn't nullable.</p>\n\n<p>How can I overcome this?</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to do is write a base class for presenters in the application which has the ability to databind controls based on a simple naming convention. The presenter knows that for TextBox it should bind the Text property, for CheckBox it should bind \"Checked\", and so on. The mapping between properties and controls is done by convention - controls presenting a field should have the same name as the field plus the control type. Hence \"Name\" presented in a TextBox maps to \"NameTextBox\" (which is the convention I like to use anyway - I have never understood why people are still fond of prefixes specifically with GUI controls, but no other kind of code!?) and \"IsMarried\" in a checkbox would become \"IsMarriedCheckBox\". </p>\n\n<p>All of this allows the presenter to offer a method that accepts an object, \"datasource\", and a container where the controls to be bound are living. This makes for very rapid work adding a bunch of fields to a screen compared to having to use a bindingsource and write code, a solution which like mine does not give any compiler checks and does mean it's easy to break things by mistypes and property renames. </p>\n\n<p>But to make my little PoC I want to know what I can handle with this, and what sorts of things will still require other solutions. The whole thing would be considerably more valuable if it could support properties of nullable types, since we use them a lot. (Nor do I want to stop using them; bundling together the concept of \"has a value\" and if so \"which value\" is elegant and makes for less code, as well as more compiler help.) </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way? Anything I can hook into? Or possible to make a generic type of my own to replace Nullable&lt;T&gt;? Since I don't understand why it doesn't work without me having to do anything, it's difficult to imagine what might be worth trying to work around it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","taskbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13249511,"title":"showing the autohiding windows taskbar","body":"<p>I have defined the windows taskbar as auto-hiding.

I then think that adding the plugin assemblies as 'Content' to the project would work, but then I have two issues: 1) TFS source control; the plugin projects need a writable target to build to, presumably - content files would be 'checked in' and 2) some of the plugins have Content of their own: with references I don't need to worry about missing something.  Going the Content route I need to refer to another project's build output folder, include all of it's content, but not the PDBs.. seems even more hacky!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have also considered and played with post-build steps for either the plugin projects (not ideal: I am pulling them into this new solution from another, if I add post-build steps it will likely screw up the other solution) or the project which depends on them (which is OK, but an XCopy with relative paths, and having to manually set up Project Dependencies.. seems more hacky again).</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I'm missing, any ideas at all?  If Copy Local chained across project references it would fit perfectly..</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","naudio"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":1,"question_id":13248500,"title":"Microphone buffer in NAudio C#","body":"<p>I set sample rate on microphone(NAudio.WaveIn) 44100Hz.

To make these operations smooth I need to set for each layer CacheMode property to BitmapCache with RenderAtScale = 2 to keep text clear when scaling.</p>\n\n<p>Setting bitmap cache increases memory consumption on <strong><em>76 Mb</em></strong> (= (2 * 1000)<sup>2</sup> pixels * 4 bytes per pixel) on <strong>WP7</strong> which is ok for the OS and on <strong><em>~ 195 Mb</em></strong> (experimental) on <strong>WP8</strong> which leads to app crash on a real device!</p>\n\n<p>Here is sample code which crashes on the <em>Lumia 920</em> and works ok on the <em>7.1 or WXGA emulators</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Rectangle Fill=\"Red\" Width=\"1000\" Height=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n        &lt;BitmapCache RenderAtScale=\"2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n&lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n&lt;Rectangle Fill=\"Red\" Width=\"1000\" Height=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n        &lt;BitmapCache RenderAtScale=\"2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n&lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n&lt;Rectangle Fill=\"Red\" Width=\"1000\" Height=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n        &lt;BitmapCache RenderAtScale=\"2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n&lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n&lt;Rectangle Fill=\"Red\" Width=\"1000\" Height=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n        &lt;BitmapCache RenderAtScale=\"2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n&lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n&lt;Rectangle Fill=\"Red\" Width=\"1000\" Height=\"1000\"&gt;\n    &lt;Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n        &lt;BitmapCache RenderAtScale=\"2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Rectangle.CacheMode&gt;\n&lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How to deal with this problem?

May be I'm missing something key to understanding .NET collections, but my thinking is since <code>Sort</code> acts on an existing <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, it should have lesser overhead (if every any) in processing when compared to <code>OrderBy</code> which acts on the same <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> (in our case <code>persons</code>) but have to return another collection <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb534852.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>IOrderedEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. But still <code>OrderBy</code> performs far far better. <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> might have certain overhead compared to <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type, but <code>Sort</code> anyway acts on the existing list! Furthermore, I'm little amused to see a <code>Linq</code> method working faster than existing .NET method. </p>\n\n<p>All the answers in the original question compare <code>Sort</code> against <code>OrderBy.ToList</code> which I believe will have some overhead and therefore performs more or less equally. </p>\n\n<p>What could be the implementation differences?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Ok I learned something new. Here is how I confirmed about deferred execution.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    BenchMark(persons =&gt;\n    {\n        persons.Sort((p1, p2) =&gt; string.Compare(p1.Name, p2.Name, true));\n        foreach (var item in persons)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n    });\n\n    BenchMark(persons =&gt;\n    {\n        IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; people = persons.OrderBy(n =&gt; n.Name);\n        foreach (var item in people)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Sort</code> ran in 4000 - 5000ms while <code>OrderBy</code> ran just above 5000ms. So indeed my conclusion was wrong. Both of them performed on equal terms once I started to enumerate the collections. I prefer the syntax of <code>OrderBy</code> anyday :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I just found that this is exact duplicate of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10299464/why-is-array-sort-so-slow-compared-to-linq?lq=1\">this one</a>.

But I'm having trouble understanding how to best handle a particular situation.  And I apologize in advance for the long explanation, but I don't know if I could be specific enough otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>The application is a general purpose record-keeping app for many different types of records, some of which are related to each other and some of which are unrelated to other records.  Each different record type we work with constitutes a distinct \"feature\" in the application.  So the startup screen for the application is essentially a switchboard from which they can select the feature they want to navigate to.  </p>\n\n<p>When they make a selection, the window (view) for that feature opens and it's from this window they can perform various operations relating to that feature.  Most of the features (e.g. Customers, Orders) have some common operations the user can perform (Creating new records, opening existing records, saving changes, printing, etc.).  Some however have operations that are specific to that one feature (e.g. a validation operation specific to the Orders feature).  My problem lies in figuring out how to perform the operations within each feature.</p>\n\n<p>Since I'm using MVP the feature window has a presenter that would respond when the user initiates any of the operations for that feature.  But since I want to follow the Single Responsibility principle I don't want the presenter to become a God class and actually know how to create records, save, print, etc.  So my thought was to define separate classes to handle each operation, as in having an ICreateOrders implementation with a .Create() method, an ISaveOrders implementation with a .Save() method, etc.  Just for the sake of having a name for them I'll call them \"resolvers\" since they actually resolve the request for that operation to happen.  Some of these common resolvers would probably have base implementations (e.g. a base FeatureSave class) because much of the code would be similar across features, but each feature needs to be able to have a specific implementation if required. This approach raises a couple of questions.</p>\n\n<p>First I want these actions to be able to be initiated from other places in the app besides just the window for that feature.  For example instead of only being able to open order records from within the Orders feature window, I'd also like to be able from the Customers feature to select \"View Orders\" and have that customer's order records opened and displayed automatically.  And to achieve code re-use I'd want to use the same IOpenOrders implementation to do the job regardless of where in the app the request was initiated from.  So simply embedding the needed resolvers in the Orders window's presenter doesn't seem like an option.</p>\n\n<p>So my thought was to create a FeatureService class that would hold a collection of Feature objects.  At app startup I'd get from the database a list of all the features that are valid for the logged-in user and I'd then iterate over that list and create a Feature object for each one and add it to the FeatureService's collection.  Then when I need to initiate an operation in one feature from another I could achieve that by just injecting the FeatureService object into the source class, getting the target feature from it, and then using that to perform the operation.  But I don't want the Feature class to be a God class either, so this would simply amount to moving all the individual resolvers from the Orders presenter to the Feature class.</p>\n\n<p>But for this to happen, the Feature object must be injected with all the resolvers it MIGHT need, without knowing if the user will perform those operations or not.  For some of the more complex features this could be 20 or 30 distinct resolvers being injected, which certainly seems like constructor injection abuse.  And while this keeps the Feature object from becoming a God class, as it's simply passing off each operation to its injected resolver, this seems wrong.  Is this correct usage when an object becomes a \"God-coordinator\" like this?</p>\n\n<p>My other question is about the volume of these objects.  For some customers there might be 50 or more separate features available (with more to follow over time no doubt).  So as I'm creating these Feature objects at startup and my container is injecting all these resolver dependencies into each one, I'm creating hundreds of objects (e.g. 40 features X 20 resolvers per feature) whether I ever access some of those features or not.  A typical user session will probably only involve going into a few features, so it seems wasteful to create so many objects at startup like this.  I could give up and just have the Feature object do ServiceLocation internally to get its resolvers, but if there's a better way, I'd like to use it.</p>\n\n<p>I can't figure out where to go from here.  I've tried to look and find examples and information on this, but I don't know if I even know enough to know what to search for.  Any guidance or insight anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wcf","c#-4.0","versioning"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13073339,"title":"WCF 4.5 Versioning","body":"<p>I have a WCF service with a data contract and etc...</p>\n\n<p>I need to make some changes in the contract, because some customers I had to change the business logic and add two data members in the data contract.

This causes the ROW_VERSION in the DB to be incremented (it is 2 now).</p></li>\n<li><p>The user of Client App 1 now changes some properties of entity object (which is still in memory with a ROW_VERSION of 1).</p></li>\n<li><p>Before Client App 1 saves the changes, it loads some other entity objects for display, and eventually selects the entity object in question again (e.g. to review the changes made). This causes a query where the result will contain the already changed entity object (because it is attached to the DbContext before the actual query is sent to the database).</p>\n\n<p><strong>And here is my problem: At this point the entity framework could compare the ROW_VERSION of the attached object with that of the object in the actual query result, detect a mismatch and e.g. throw an exception.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But instead the EF treats the ROW_VERSION property like all other properties which could just have been changed by the client.</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I wish the EF to treat the ROW_VERSION property specially and compare its values on every query to detect changes by other clients. This way I would detect concurrency situations earlier than when waiting for the SaveChanges call.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net",".net","unit-testing","user","identity"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":4,"question_id":12780185,"title":"Writing Unit Test for methods that use User.Identity.Name in ASP.NET MVC","body":"<p>I am writing test cases using the Unit Test for ASP.NET MVC 4 with Web Api.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have an action which makes a call to some method I have defined in the service layer, where I have used the following line of code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>string username = User.Identity.Name;\n// do something with username\n// return something\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now how to I create unit test method for this, I am getting null reference exceptions.

Client connections are long-lived - typically hours. (The server is part of a trading system. The client messages are aggregated into groups to send to an exchange over a smaller number of 'outbound' socket connections, and acknowledgment messages are sent back to the clients as each group is processed by the exchange.) OS is Windows Server 2003, hardware is 2 x 4-core X5355. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Current client socket design:</strong> A <code>TcpListener</code> spawns a thread to read each client socket as clients connect. The threads block on <code>Socket.Receive</code>, parsing incoming messages and inserting them into a set of queues for processing by the core server logic. Acknowledgment messages are sent back out over the client sockets using async <code>Socket.BeginSend</code> calls from the threads that talk to the exchange side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Observed problems:</strong> As the client count has grown (now 60-70), we have started to see intermittent delays of up to 100s of milliseconds while sending and receiving data to/from the clients. (We log timestamps for each acknowledgment message, and we can see occasional long gaps in the timestamp sequence for bunches of acks from the same group that normally go out in a few ms total.) </p>\n\n<p>Overall system CPU usage is low (&lt; 10%), there is plenty of free RAM, and the core logic and the outbound (exchange-facing) side are performing fine, so the problem seems to be isolated to the client-facing socket code. There is ample network bandwidth between the server and clients (gigabit LAN), and we have ruled out network or hardware-layer problems.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions or pointers to useful resources would be greatly appreciated.

(One can use a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1346480/how-to-make-a-net-application-large-address-aware\">hack</a> to turn on the large address aware flag but MarkH's answer shows that checks inside the .NET Framework will break things because the address space is assumed to be only 2GB, not 3GB.)</p>\n\n<p>This means that all correct virtual memory addresses a pointer can have (as far as the .NET Framework is concerned) will be between 0x00000000 and 0x7FFFFFFF. When this range is translated to signed <code>int</code>, no values would be negative because the highest bit is not set. This reinforces my belief that there's no difference in using IntPtr vs UIntPtr. Is my reasoning correct?</strike></p>\n\n<p>Fermat2357 pointed out that the above edit is wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","console-application","exit-code"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":0,"question_id":13195491,"title":"How do I make my console application return an integer?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155610/how-do-i-specify-the-exit-code-of-a-console-application-in-net\">How do I specify the exit code of a console application in .net?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to have a console app that returns a value to the caller (I will call it by a PowerShell script).</p>\n\n<p>How can I change the entry-point to the console app?

First I have a <code>BaseController</code> that sets a <code>ViewBag</code> property listing all of the possible categories:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        _connection.Open();\n        this.ViewBag.AvailableCategories = new MultiSelectList(_connection.Query&lt;Category&gt;(\"select * from Category\"), \"CategoryID\", \"Name\");\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        throw new HttpException(500, ex.Message);\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        _connection.Close();\n    }\n\n    base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, when navigating to <code>/Event/View/1</code> I have the <code>EventController</code> setup (<strong>NOTE</strong> this controller bases the aforementioned controller) with the following <code>View</code> method.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ActionResult View(int id)\n{\n    Event evt = null;\n\n    try\n    {\n        evt = Event.Where(_connection, id);\n        if (evt == null)\n        {\n            throw new HttpException(404, \"Oops!

However, I'm running into a problem when trying to set up the main windows service engines, which need to establish connections to the RabbitMQ server to do their thing.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the <code>ConnectionFactory</code> object in RabbitMQ's .NET client is not abstract and implements no interfaces.  I can't see an obvious way to inject this class using an IoC container like StructureMap.  Even the code examples in the documentation show just blatantly <code>new</code>ing it up, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code> ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();\n factory.Uri = \"amqp://user:pass@hostName:port/vhost\";\n IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The solution that presents itself to me is to push up the entire factory into the service's main <code>OnStart</code> and <code>OnStop</code> functions, which are really difficult to test and not of huge interest anyway.  However, that leaves me with a single <code>IConnection</code> for the service, so if that connection is broken in any way, the service has no way to recover and must simply exit.  If the main engine had visibility to the factory, it could simply produce a new connection and continue.  But unless I inject that, there is no way to test the main engine without connecting to an existing server!</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything I am missing here?  Any other option I'm not considering?  How can I go about injecting this factory, and if I can't, how can I limit the damage?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also, as an afterthought, I'm perfectly happy to make a change to RabbitMQ's .NET client to implement an interface on this if someone has a good idea of how receptive the main dev team would be to a change like this.  I'd be delighted to contribute, but the last thing I want to do is have my programs working on some custom version of RabbitMQ, thereby eliminating the main benefit of using a third party library in the first place.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","mysql","vb.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13194056,"title":"Delegate Error when converting C# to VBNET","body":"<p>I have this code in c#</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Backup()\n{\n    string constr = \"server=localhost;user=root;pwd=qwerty;database=test;\";\n    string file = \"C:\\\\MyDumpFile.sql\";\n    MySqlBackup mb = new MySqlBackup(constr);\n    mb.ExportInfo.FileName = file;\n    mb.ExportProgressChanged += new MySqlBackup.exportProgressChange(mb_ExportProgressChanged);\n    mb.ExportCompleted += new MySqlBackup.exportComplete(mb_ExportCompleted);\n    timerRead.Start();\n    mb.Export();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when converted to <code>VBNet</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub Backup()\n    Dim constr As String = \"server=localhost;user=root;pwd=qwerty;database=test;\"\n    Dim file As String = \"C:\\MyDumpFile.sql\"\n    Dim mb As New MySqlBackup(constr)\n    mb.ExportInfo.FileName = file\n    mb.ExportProgressChanged = mb.ExportProgressChanged + New MySqlBackup.exportProgressChange(mb_ExportProgressChanged)\n    mb.ExportCompleted = mb.ExportCompleted + New MySqlBackup.exportComplete(mb_ExportCompleted)\n    timerRead.Start()\n    mb.Export()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I always get this error</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'exportProgressChange' is a type in\n  'MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlBackup' and cannot be used as an\n  expression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","configuration"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13194039,"title":"How to test the transformed web.config on localhost?","body":"<p>I have a classic development architecture : </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3 different Server </li>\n<li>3 different DB :</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>=> A distinct couple for each  Dev, Test &amp; Prod</p>\n\n<p>Each config has thus its own connection string.\nThe Web.config has 3 transformation available, one for each config.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that the transformation of the web.config doesn't seems to occur on localhost...</p>\n\n<p>If it's true, How can I have the right (transformed) web.config corresponding to my chosen config on localhost?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","localization","cultureinfo","culture"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13193603,"title":"culture locale make up","body":"<p>The following is the culture locale for Belgium with the french language: fr-BE</p>\n\n<p>fr is the Two Letter ISO Language Name</p>\n\n<p>But what is the correct term/name for the \"BE\" aspect of the culture local?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","webbrowser-control"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9546,"score":12,"question_id":2476360,"title":"Disable JavaScript error in WebBrowser control","body":"<p>I am developing a windows application with a WebBrowser control that navigates to a sharepoint site.<br>\nMy problem is that i am getting JavaScript error.</p>\n\n<p>How can i disable the JavaScript error?

Workstation GC is hosted in console and Windows Forms applications. It performs full (generation 2) collections concurrently with the running program, thereby minimizing latency. This mode is useful for client applications, where perceived performance is usually more important than raw throughput.</p>\n  \n  <p>The server GC is available only on multiprocessor computers. It creates a separate managed heap and thread for each processor and performs collections in parallel. During collection, all managed threads are paused (threads running native code are paused only when the native call returns). In this way, the server GC mode maximizes throughput (the number of requests per second) and improves performance as the number of processors increases.

It is\n  far more random than the data generated by the typical random number\n  generator such as the one shipped with your C compiler.</p>\n  \n  <p>This function is often used to generate random <em>initialization vectors</em>\n  and <em>salt values</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Software random number generators work in fundamentally the same way.\n  They start with a random number, known as the seed, and then use an\n  algorithm to generate a pseudo-random sequence of bits based on it.\n  The most difficult part of this process is to get a seed that is truly\n  random. This is usually based on user input latency, or the jitter\n  from one or more hardware components.</p>\n  \n  <p>With Microsoft CSPs, <strong>CryptGenRandom</strong> uses the same random number\n  generator used by other security components. This allows numerous\n  processes to contribute to a system-wide seed. CryptoAPI stores an\n  intermediate random seed with every user. To form the seed for the\n  random number generator, a calling application supplies bits it might\n  have—for instance, mouse or keyboard timing input—that are then\n  combined with both the stored seed and various system data and user\n  data such as the process ID and thread ID, the system clock, the\n  system time, the system counter, memory status, free disk clusters,\n  the hashed user environment block. This result is used to seed the\n  pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). [...] If an application has access to a good random source, it can\n  fill the <em>pbBuffer</em> buffer with some random data before calling\n  <strong>CryptGenRandom</strong>. The CSP then uses this data to further randomize its\n  internal seed. It is acceptable to omit the step of initializing the\n  <em>pbBuffer</em> buffer before calling <strong>CryptGenRandom</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["c#","android","iphone",".net","sms"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13003343,"title":"How to send sms from .Net application via phone connected to pc","body":"<p>We have a legacy .Net application which can send/receive sms from the connected phone, currently it uses old Nokia 5110 phone to send/recieve sms.

The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This puzzled me as we are using EF and the connection handling should have been automatic.</p>\n\n<p>So I started digging. The first potential culprit I considered was MiniProfiler (or I should say, our implementation of using miniprofiler). We have been using this and it has been working well, but I was worried about potential connection leaks.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public OurContext() : base(GetProfilerConnection(), true)\n    {}\n\n    private static DbConnection GetProfilerConnection()\n    {\n        return new EFProfiledDbConnection(new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"Database\"].ConnectionString),\n                                          MiniProfiler.Current);\n    }       \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was under the impression that the \"true\" parameter in the base call caused the context to take ownership of the connection so I believe that this should work fine and the connection will be disposed of.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8X4Qq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In our Enhancement DEV branch I've removed miniprofiler as it has not been updated to support EF5 and we're going to be migrating at some point in the not too distant future, so this should be removed as a concern.</p>\n\n<p>Concern two was \"are we disposing our datacontexts properly\"? So I downloaded Entity Framework Profiler on a trial and took our heaviest page and ran a test.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3CxJr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The results showed explicitly that any context we opened was closed, the concerning part to me however is the number of contexts we open. We have our DI container (Ninject 2) setup to instatiate one context per web http request, which I'd\nconsider correct. The problem comes into pay with how we handle images in our application. This page in particular can have up to seven images in the database. Each of these images is included in the page via a MVC action.\nLike so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[&lt;img src=\"/Controller/GetPhotoAction/[ImageId] /&gt;]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the image is a separte request a separate context is being opened. So, for this particular page, we are utilizing seven different connections from the connection pool if I'm understanding this correctly. Multiply this by however many users and I see\nhow the error message above could be true.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for storing images in the database is twofold. One, our administrative application to manage the data for this app is on the US West Coast, but the servers hosting the application are on the US East Coast. There is a \nVPN tunnel between our network here at work on the West Coast and the servers on the East Coast. The app is load balanced as well (2 web front ends). The decision was made to store the images in the DB to avoid copying the images \nthrough a VPN tunnel and then dealing with permissions to writing the images to a file location within the web app on each server (the two locations are also completely different domains). </p>\n\n<p>In the interim, while we test, we have upped the max connection pool size in our connection string and will be deploying this out to PROD early next week.</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Have I covered my bases in leak checking here? I believe I have. Am I wrong in anything I stated above?</p>\n\n<p>2) If the multiple data contexts on this page prove to be the culprit, suggestions on how to write an image to two servers across the country keeping in mind permissions will cross domains?

A factual answer would help me decide if it's worth spending more effort on reducing the compilation time, many thanks.</em></p>\n\n<p>Is it ever sensible to use the .net JIT compiler to execute a largely straight-line segment of 10 000 000 simple IL instructions? The instructions are mostly memory accesses, the usual arithmetic/logic/operations, and short branches. There is no memory allocation, runtime typing, or anything else that would at first sight appear difficult to compile.</p>\n\n<p>[ The comments on the previous questions suggested I should provide the code. It's not easily possible since the code is very long and I have not yet figured out how to save it to disc, though the pattern really is very simple. It's just a lot of fragments in sequence. Each fragment pushes a reference to a member (of the one object the whole code is in). This member is an array, and it is accessed at a constant index. This may be repeated a few times. Then there is a simple bit of computation. A result is then written back to the array. The sequence of instructions for the last step is similar to that for the first, and is something like Ldarg_0, Ldfld, Ldc_I4, Conv_I, ..., Stelem. This should hopefully not be in any way controversial - but it's about the most complex thing the code does ]</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript",".net","ajaxpro"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":1,"question_id":13172421,"title":"Namespace undefined error in javascript to execute ajax method from asp.net page","body":"<p>I am Using Ajax Pro</p>\n\n<p>I am  not getting any error on my machine when i test the web site but getting an error of TimeSheet is undefined (TimeSheet is the namespace) from the hosting.</p>\n\n<p>I get this error in the following cdoe from javascript function</p>\n\n<pre><code>try\n{\nvar response = TimeSheet.DAL.ApexDalc.PopulateDuration(d1, d3);\n}\ncatch(txt)\n{\n alert(txt.message);\n return false;\n}\n\nalert(response.value.Tables[0].Rows[0].Hours);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have registered Ajaxpro in the page load with <code>AjaxPro.Utility.RegisterTypeForAjax(typeof(DAL.ApexDalc));</code></p>\n\n<p>I have added httphandlers in web.config also:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;httpHandlers&gt;\n    &lt;add verb=\"POST,GET\" path=\"ajaxpro/*.ashx\" type=\"AjaxPro.AjaxHandlerFactory, AjaxPro.2\"/&gt;\n    &lt;remove verb=\"*\" path=\"*.asmx\"/&gt;\n    &lt;add verb=\"*\" path=\"*.asmx\" validate=\"false\" type=\"System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptHandlerFactory, System.Web.Extensions, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can you suggest what can be the cause of error in the web site from hosting server?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","asp.net-web-api"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":1,"question_id":13171684,"title":"CA 1822 WEB api","body":"<p>I'm using .net webapi for creating RESTFUL services.

I have noticed that a lot of the errors occur during calls to ADODB (not always in the same place or on the same call), but it has also crashed on calls to form.ShowDialog(). </p>\n\n<p>The form where ShowDialog is being called writes some log information to the \nDB using ADODB. Though I haven't been able to confirm, I am guessing the exception within the form.ShowDialog() is happening during one of these ADODB calls. The crashing on the ADODB calls is happening in assemblies that are successfully being used in the other two apps that were converted and it doesn't consistently crash in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>In my research on this I have seen that bad interop can cause this issue. Wondering if the ADODB COM calls are somehow causing the issue in this app even though these calls are fine in the other apps.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the places I've observed calls that are apparently throwing this exception to the event log:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>newing an ADODB.recordset</li>\n<li>Creating a new parameter within a command.append</li>\n<li>connection.open calls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would anyone have any ideas how I can narrow this down to possibly trace the \nissue to its root cause?

Indeed endless questions about uniqueness. This is <strong>not a question about 2^128 uniqueness</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is to determine just how random the <strong>first section</strong>, secifically the <em>first</em> four bytes of the GUID is in .NET . Based on research, it is supposedly the least significant 32 bits of timestamp. But how is timestamp converted?

If you have an even spread for each new GUID, then you can use table partitioning based on the first 1,2,3 or 4 bytes based on how many partitions you need. I have seen a 2 billion row table with 10 million inserts a day,  with 128 partitions using the first 2 bytes  as partition key. NOTE under DB2 the the first part of the key had to be used. Quote DB2 DBA. This greatly improved throughput on the DB. The second use is batch job parallel key allocation.  If you know you have approximately N rows as a batch task, you can allocate key ranges to parallel jobs.  Without a homogenous split, the dispatcher must first calculate the from and to keys for each job. If that means reading 100 millions and managing them in memory just to dispatch work, the first x minutes is lost to job dispatch.  In the example I have seen it was around 15 mins. So there a 2 excellent reasons to use and want Evenly spread GUIds.</p>\n\n<p>The SAP Banking system actually introduced a custom GUID routine to resolve the lack randomness in the first Section of the GUID. For those with access to an SAP banking system, the Function is BANK_DISTRIBUTED_ID_CREATE. the comments in the code explain why they did it. Those with access to SAP support there is a note 496904 explains why they see it necessary to fix guids.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the custom routine there were clear skews in the GUIDs under AIX.

I can't.</p>\n\n<p>If I wanted to schedule a text at a later date, I can't - all I can do is have the message populated, ready for me to send.</p>\n\n<p>And why? It makes little sense to limit these. OK, it makes some sense in regards to stopping developers having access to sending text messages (to protect the consumer from malicious dudes (especially if there is a cost of the text involved))... but no! This is what internet security does - or the UAC in Windows... It allows users to set permissions.

It does not happen by itself from what it seems.\nAnother I believe worthy update: I have dived deeper into the subject of building grapsh etc. I have also downloaded the GrapStudio software in order to play with different filter settings. <strong>However</strong>, as soon as I choose the Render Media File submenu and point it to the problematic video it says 'cannot render file'! Nothing less, nothing more,the video file plays just fine in Windows media player, or VLC. It was encoded with h264video codec, provided by FFDSHOW.</p>\n\n<p>Another Update:\nI have managed to make GraphStudio render movie (File->Render MEdia File), with use of K-Lite codec pack x64. The graph is built (takes use of LAV Video Decoder). My app STILL fails to auto-generate a graph, though its targeted for x64 platform as well and from what I've read GraphStudio just calls the same API function. That is very strange. So I have decided to build a semi-automatic graph.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Guid gui = new Guid(\"EE30215D-164F-4A92-A4EB-9D4C13390F9F\");\nObject o;\nty = Type.GetTypeFromCLSID(gui);\no = Activator.CreateInstance(ty, false);\nIBaseFilter ibfVideoDec = (IBaseFilter)o;\nhr=m_FilterGraph.AddFilter(ibfVideoDec, \"LAV Video decoder\");\nDsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While adding other filters which I need, followed by a call to RenderFile. NOTHING. All of the filters were initialized by their corresponding CLSID, no error there. It wont render.Anyone?\nif you ask me that DirectShowNet or maybe DirectShow as whole is terribly documented when it comes to use of modern codecs etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","panel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13143532,"title":"Create a panel in winForms c# with multiple sections in full screen mode","body":"<p>I would like to create a form that can have multiple panels with a single picturebox in each panel and each panel can be moved around.</p>\n\n<p>The panels need to fit on the maximum size of the monitor with each panel having equal width. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to get the form to start at the maximum size using the WindowState Property but cannot get the panels' width to be split depending on the number of panels that are there.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I have tried to use a flow-panel as the main container and tried adding panels as required inside the flow-panel.

It doesn't look like there is a problem with that from the implementation point of view, but for some reason the functionality is not made available it seems.</p>\n\n<p>Also this is not a trivial case as the same method can be used to iterate from a known position to another modifying values in that range.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to do this in C# with any of the keyed collections in .NET without using 3rd party libraries?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n<p>Jeeves</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","linq","linq-to-sql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":1,"question_id":13129135,"title":"LINQ to SQL query Multiply two columns and calculate SUM","body":"<p>Here's the SQL query</p>\n\n<pre><code>Select sum(f.Acres*m.credit1), sum(f.Acres*m.credit2), sum(f.Acres*m.credit3)\nfrom first f join model m on f.Id = m.fID\nwhere m.year == 2012\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How to write this above SQL in LINQ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wpf","task-parallel-library"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":3,"question_id":13124329,"title":"Event on Task Result is done","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5971686/how-to-create-a-task-tpl-running-a-sta-thread\">How to create a task (TPL) running a STA thread?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var task = Task.Factory.StartNew&lt;List&lt;NewTwitterStatus&gt;&gt;(\n        () =&gt; GetTweets(securityKeys),  \n        TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);\n\nDispatcher.BeginInvoke(DispatcherPriority.Background,\n    new Action(() =&gt;\n    {\n        var result = task.Result; // ERROR!!!

Here's where I got to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Provides an invoker that can be used to authenticate a BaseOperationRequest message.\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic class UserAuthenticationInvoker : IOperationInvoker {\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The original operation invoker.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    private IOperationInvoker _originalInvoker;\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The injected User service, for authentication.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    [Inject]\n    public IUserService UserService { get; set; }\n\n\n    public UserAuthenticationInvoker(IOperationInvoker originalInvoker) {\n        _originalInvoker = originalInvoker;\n    }\n\n    #region Implementation of IOperationInvoker {\n\n    public object[] AllocateInputs() {\n        return _originalInvoker.AllocateInputs();\n    }\n\n    public object Invoke(object instance, object[] inputs, out object[] outputs) {\n        // Validate base request\n        if(!(inputs[0] is BaseOperationRequest)) {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"The request object must inherit from BaseOperationRequest in order for User authentication to take place.\");\n        }\n\n        // Get BaseOperationRequest\n        var req = (BaseOperationRequest)inputs[0];\n\n        // Authenticate the User\n        var authResult = UserService.AuthenticateUser(new AuthenticateUserRequest {\n            Token = req.Token,\n            Password = req.Password\n        });\n        if(authResult.Success) {\n            // This is where I get stuck - do I need to modify \"outputs\"?

Socket.Receive will return as much data as in the protocol stack at the time or block until data is available. This is why we have to continously read from the socket until we receive the number of bytes in the length indicator. The Socket.Receive will return 0 if the other side closed the connection. I understand all that.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a minimum number of bytes that has to be read? The reason I ask is from the documentation it seems entirely possible that the entire length indicator (4 bytes) might not be available when socket.Receive can return. We would then have to have to keep trying. It would be more efficient to minimize the number of times we call socket.receive because it has to copy things in and out of buffers. So is it safer to get a single byte at a time to get the length indicator, is it safe to assume that 4 bytes will always be available or should we keep trying to get 4 bytes using an offset variable?</p>\n\n<p>The reason that I think that there may be some sort of default minimum level is that I came across a varaible called ReceiveLowWater variable that I can set in the socket options.

The object are very complex, with lots of nested xsd's and different namespaces. Proxy classes are generated by adding a Web Reference to an original wsdl with 30+ webmethods and using xsd.exe for generating the missing SOAPFault objects. My pilot WCF Service consists of only 1 webmethod which matches the exact syntax of one of the original methods: 1 object as parameter, returning 1 other object as result value. I greated a WCF Interface using those proxy classes, using attributes: XMLSerializerFormat and ServiceContract on the interface, OperationContract on one method from original wsdl specifying Action, ReplyAction, all with the proper namespaces. I create incoming client messages using SoapUI; I generated a project from the original WSDL files (causing the SoapUI project to have 30+ methods) and created one new Request at the one implemented WebMethod, changed the url to my wcf webservice and send the message. Because of the specified (Reply-)Action in the OperationContractAttribute, the message is actually received and properly deserialized into an object. To get this far (40 hours of googling), a lot of frustration led me to using a custom endpoint in which the WCF 'wrapped tags' are removed, the namespaces for nested types are corrected, and the generated wsdl get's flattened (for better compatibility with other tools then MS VisualStudio).</p>\n\n<p>Interface code is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[XmlSerializerFormat(Use = OperationFormatUse.Literal, Style = OperationFormatStyle.Document, SupportFaults = true)]\n[ServiceContract(Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN)]\npublic interface IOntvangAsynchroon\n{\n\n    [OperationContract(Action = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN + \"/zakLk01\", ReplyAction = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN + \"/zakLk01\", Name = \"zakLk01\")]\n    [FaultContract(typeof(Fo03Bericht), Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStuf)]\n    Bv03Bericht zakLk01([XmlElement(\"zakLk01\", Namespace = Constants.NamespaceStufZKN)] ZAKLk01 zakLk011);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I use a Webclient in code to send a message, everything works. My problem is, when I use a WCF client. I use ChannelFactory&lt; IOntvangAsynchroon > to send a message. But the generated xml looks different: it includes the parametername of the method! It took me a lot of time to figure this one out, but here's what happens:</p>\n\n<p>Correct xml (stripped soap envelope):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;soap:Body&gt;\n&lt;zakLk01 xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/sector/zkn/0310\"&gt;\n&lt;stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;berichtcode xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;Bv01&lt;/berichtcode&gt;\n&lt;zender xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;\n&lt;applicatie&gt;ONBEKEND&lt;/applicatie&gt;\n&lt;/zender&gt;\n&lt;/stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;parameters&gt;\n&lt;/parameters&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk01&gt;\n&lt;/soap:Body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Bad xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;soap:Body&gt;\n&lt;zakLk01 xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/sector/zkn/0310\"&gt;\n&lt;zakLk011&gt;\n&lt;stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;berichtcode xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;Bv01&lt;/berichtcode&gt;\n&lt;zender xmlns=\"http://www.egem.nl/StUF/StUF0301\"&gt;\n&lt;applicatie&gt;ONBEKEND&lt;/applicatie&gt;\n&lt;/zender&gt;\n&lt;/stuurgegevens&gt;\n&lt;parameters&gt;\n&lt;/parameters&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk011&gt;\n&lt;/zakLk01&gt;\n&lt;/soap:Body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the 'zakLk011' element? It is the name of the parameter of the method in my interface! So NOW it is zakLk011, but it when my parameter name was 'zakLk01', the xml seemed to contain some magical duplicate of the tag above, but without namespace. Of course, you can imagine me going crazy over what was happening before finding out it was the parametername!</p>\n\n<p>I now have actually created a WCF Service, at which I cannot send messages using a WCF Client anymore. For clarity: The method does get invoked using the WCF Client on my webservice, but the parameter object is empty. Because I'm using a custom endpoint to log the incoming xml, I can see the message is received fine, but just with the wrong syntax!</p>\n\n<p>WCF client code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZAKLk01 stufbericht = MessageFactory.CreateZAKLk01();\nChannelFactory&lt;IOntvangAsynchroon&gt; factory = new ChannelFactory&lt;IOntvangAsynchroon&gt;(new BasicHttpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(\"http://localhost:8193/Roxit/Link/zkn0310\"));\nfactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new LinkEndpointBehavior());\nIOntvangAsynchroon client = factory.CreateChannel();\nclient.zakLk01(stufbericht);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not using a generated client, i just reference the webservice (share libraries) like I am used to.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: When generating a Service Reference, it generates duplicate classes(dont know why..). When these duplicates are removed however, a client sends messages with correct xml. But my architecture requires shared libraries, so this doesn't help me out.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone please help me?

Therefore when you click the button the list will be empty.If you dynamically populate the list, the items are not remembered. You must added in each Page_load. The view state will only remember which item was selected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How it does then remember the items when the page is executed directly from the IDE and not remember when i run from a virtual directory. Is there a view state that i might need to set to get it working. The cache setting also did not do much luck. I enabled Trace info, funny thing again :|, tracing is happening when executed directly from the IDE and not from the virual directory. Question again, the child directory's web.config should override the parent web.config right ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for replying.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","reflection"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":83,"score":1,"question_id":13130286,"title":"Dynamically setting the <T> when calling a generic method","body":"<p>I am having an issue trying to recursively use a generic function for a deserialization algorithm.

For example, if the PictureBox is \"more widescreen\" in relation to the image (see screenshot), it means the PictureBox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally, showing its background color (in this case red) to the left and right of the image. Then I assume the image's displayed height is the same as PictureBox.Height, and work from there.</p>\n\n<p>There's a problem, though.

Now resize the Form vertically, as slow as you can. You should see a red margin at the bottom every now and then.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize, showing a margin to the right.</p>\n\n<p>It's because of this small imperfection that I know the zoom factor cannot be calculated the way I have been doing it; the result would only be an approximate.

Now let me explain my situation...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a dashboard that only displays current running status to the user.  It executes various select queries against a Sql Server DB and performs some calculations that are eventually displayed to the user on the dashboard.  The user can open multiple dashboards at the same time.  I have a timer thread that refreshes the dashboard every few seconds.  That timer thread spawns another thread (actually queues work on a threadpool) to perform long running calculations/queries.    </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the user clicks the X to close the Dashboard window, it needs to shut down right away (say within a second, I think 2 seconds is too long).  So I use this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)\n    {\n        _timerThread.Abort();\n    }\n\n    private void Timer_Elapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        // we're on the timer thread now\n\n        try\n        {\n            RefreshUi();\n        }\n        catch (ThreadAbortException)\n        {\n            System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort();\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            MessageBox.Show(ex.ToString());\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is sometimes the ThreadAbortException is caught, and sometimes it isn't.  I find it's mostly uncaught when in the middle of executing queries.</p>\n\n<p><em>[UPDATE]</em> I've recently discovered I can catch the ThreadAbortException if I check the innerexception.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is it ok use Thread.Abort() in this case?  If so, how do I ALWAYS catch the ThreadAbortException so the user doesn't see it when closing the Form? (from what I've read I don't think this is possible)</li>\n<li>If it's not ok to use Thread.Abort() (which is what I think most of you will answer), then here are my other concerns with using a \"global boolean flag\" to tell the thread(s) when to shutdown.\n<ul>\n<li>I'm concerned the threads won't stop themselves within the 1 second time limit. (For example, I may have some queries that take 1-2 seconds to run)</li>\n<li>I will have to clutter my code with: if(shouldShutdown) statements.</li>\n<li>Should I make the shouldShutdown flag static so all my classes can use it?  Will this pose a problem if the user can open multiple dashboards at the same time? (I'm concerned about the static variable being shared across all dashboards. This I definetely don't want.)</li>\n<li>When the worker threads see they have to shutdown, should they throw an exception or just return?  If they just return, then I'll have to add even more if(shouldShutdown) checks because it's ok for some functions to return false.  If throwing an exception is ok, which exception do you recommend?  A custom one?</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","internet-explorer","selenium","webdriver"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":13117971,"title":"Clicking a link within a dropdown menu using C# WebDriver","body":"<p>I've used every possible combination/variation I could think of involving Actions.MouseMove and IMouse (with elements and coordinates), Actions.Click, Actions.DoubleClick, IWebElement.Click, and Thread.Sleep.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what I do, it always either mouses out of the dropdown menu before trying to click (thus raising an exception when trying to click the element) or seemingly successfully clicks the link but then fails to cause the browser (IE 9) to follow the link.</p>\n\n<p>However, I've gotten to click the link and proceed to the following page as expected when running in Debug mode (haven't figured out why).</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>(I'd post some code here, but I've scrapped and rewritten and tweaked code for this problem so many times with essentially identical results that I'm not sure how useful it'd be; at this point, I'm basically fishing for completely novel approaches for me to test out and report back on, rather than minor tweaks to any particular revision of my code.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: By request: the HTML code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"sxmenu_main\"&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;span&gt;Header Item 1&lt;/span&gt;\n                    &lt;ul&gt;\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/linka\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Link A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/linkb\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Link B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;/ul&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;span&gt;Header Item 2&lt;/span&gt;\n                    &lt;ul&gt;\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/linka\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Link A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/linkb\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Link B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;/ul&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","charts"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13129062,"title":"chart series - markerstyle not showing","body":"<p>can anyone tell me please what i am doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p>i have a chart with multiple series displayed als lines.

(without coding it myself which may be prone to errors).</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","sql","windows","application"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":3,"question_id":13128604,"title":"What is the best method for storing data locally inside an EXE for a windows application","body":"<p>I have a small windows application I wrote using Visual Studio 2010, CSharp, .NET 4.0 that does some scanning of remote pages using HTTP Requests, Pings, and DNS lookups.</p>\n\n<p>It then shows the results of the scan in tables (tabbed at the top) ordered by a column.</p>\n\n<p>It's pretty simple but I want to add a \"settings\" panel or menu option so that the user can add certain configuration options such as\n -Timeout duration (HTTP calls)\n -Proxy details (port and IP) \n -Useragent\n -Email login details, port, email account type IMAP/POP3, password etc\n -Anything else</p>\n\n<p>Therefore I want to add a small DB that is \"ingrained\" into the application and comes as part of the .EXE.</p>\n\n<p>I am used to writing client / server apps where the DB is on a remote server and the app somewhere else and using ADO connection strings to connect to this remote SQL Server which I then use management studio to look at the data.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure where to start with this type of small DB hooked into the app. Do I use SQlLite or SQL CE or some other kind of MS SQL DB.</p>\n\n<p>Do I have to write code inside the app to \"create the DB, tables and populate them\" and then get the data back out if they exist to show to the user so they can edit the details.</p>\n\n<p>Does the DB sit separately from the .EXE or is it part of the .EXE when I give it out to people as ideally I want it to be all part of the .EXE.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure there are great tutorials online which I am looking through but I would just like to hear other peoples thoughts on the way to go and the best approach.</p>\n\n<p>Any links to guides or tutorials would be great if you have any.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"}]}
