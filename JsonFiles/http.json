I don't know what else to tell you. I hosted a simple HTML page on my website with a couple links to various pages on that website (all starting with \"http://members.iracing.com/...\") and when I click any of them, they simply open in the browser without ever asking me which app I want to use. I tried it both on the emulator as well as after installing the app on my physical device, nothing works. I tried this in a completely BLANK, new Android project just to see if that would work, nothing. </p>\n\n<p>I then realized that the website requires authentication, and if you are not logged in it redirects to the login page at <a href=\"https://members.iracing.com/membersite/login.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://members.iracing.com/membersite/login.jsp</a>, hence I tried replacing the scheme by \"https\".

I'm not sure if the redirect is relevant though, the browser clearly first goes to the non-redirected site, then does the redirect to the login page, but at no point do I get the choice to open it in my app. Furthermore, if I login manually in the browser first, there is no redirect, and it still does not work.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something obvious here?

Its simpler smaller and it seems to work fine in FireFox!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>\n1.What are the pros and cons of using protocollless Urls?<br>\n2.Why aren't other folks using them?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks! Very curious to your insights.  Much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","objective-c","ios","http","post"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13250419,"title":"Error in AFHTTPClient POST","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a http post to a web server in an iPhone App with AFHTTPClient.

Here's the weird thing: When I take a URL constructed with this code and put it directly into my browser window, the server does its job even if there is a space in the value. So this URL sent from my script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://[ip]/setsetting/setting1=value 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does not work, but if I plug that same url into my browser (Chrome), it does work.

The REST service returns a String which is then placed onto a JMS queue using the request-response pattern. The idea is that the String placed on the queue will be consumed by some consumer and a reponse will created using the Reply-To address. So basically this is implimenting synchronous JMS.</p>\n\n<p>The flow works as expected, except when the HTTP endpoint is secured using Basic Authentication. In this case the response is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.io.NotSerializableException: com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerResponse (org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationException). Message payload is of type: MuleResponseWriter$1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and no message is placed on the queue. Removing Basic Authentication results in no exception being thrown. Also, removing the JMS outbound endpoint results in the String being echoed back which leads me to believe the problem is with the JMS endpoint. I suspect that the problem is with the response from the JMS endpoint because setting component in the flow to one-way negates the problem. I think the issue might be that the endpoint is sending some response to the HTTP endpoint without authentication credentials and it fails because of it, but I'm unsure how to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the flow that I created:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mule\n    xmlns:scripting=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting\"\n    xmlns:context=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/context\" xmlns=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core\"\n    xmlns:http=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http\" xmlns:jms=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms\"\n    xmlns:jersey=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey\"\n    xmlns:doc=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation\"\n    xmlns:spring=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\" xmlns:core=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core\"\n    version=\"CE-3.3.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n    xmlns:mule-ss=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security\"\n    xmlns:json=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json\"\n    xmlns:ss=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/security\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms/current/mule-jms.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey/current/mule-jersey.xsd \n    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting/current/mule-scripting.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security/3.1/mule-spring-security.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json/current/mule-json.xsd \n    http://www.springframework.org/schema/security http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.0.xsd \"&gt;\n&lt;jms:activemq-connector name=\"Active_MQ\" specification=\"1.1\" brokerURL=\"tcp://localhost:61616\"\n                        validateConnections=\"true\" doc:name=\"Active MQ\"/&gt;\n&lt;mule-ss:security-manager&gt;\n    &lt;mule-ss:delegate-security-provider name=\"memory-provider\" delegate-ref=\"authenticationManager\"/&gt;\n&lt;/mule-ss:security-manager&gt;\n&lt;spring:beans&gt;\n    &lt;ss:authentication-manager alias=\"authenticationManager\"&gt;\n        &lt;ss:authentication-provider&gt;\n            &lt;ss:user-service id=\"userService\"&gt;\n                &lt;ss:user name=\"username\" password=\"password\" authorities=\"ROLE_ADMIN\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/ss:user-service&gt;\n        &lt;/ss:authentication-provider&gt;\n    &lt;/ss:authentication-manager&gt;\n&lt;/spring:beans&gt;\n&lt;flow name=\"RESTAPISync\" doc:name=\"RESTAPISync\"&gt;\n    &lt;http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=\"request-response\" host=\"localhost\" port=\"8081\" doc:name=\"HTTP\"&gt;\n        &lt;mule-ss:http-security-filter realm=\"realm\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/http:inbound-endpoint&gt;\n    &lt;jersey:resources doc:name=\"REST\"&gt;\n        &lt;component class=\"SFREST\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/jersey:resources&gt;\n    &lt;jms:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=\"request-response\" queue=\"tmp\" connector-ref=\"Active_MQ\"\n                           doc:name=\"JMS\"/&gt;\n&lt;/flow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The SFREST.java component:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import javax.ws.rs.GET;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\n\n\n@Path(\"/pops\")\npublic class SFREST{\n\n    @GET\n    public String getPOPs()  throws Exception{\n        return \"hello\";\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR 2012-11-04 21:40:57,485 [[jmstest].connector.http.mule.default.receiver.02] org.mule.exception.DefaultMessagingExceptionStrategy:\n********************************************************************************\nMessage               : Authentication Attempt Failed.

I wish to implement this in such a way that it will work in the presence of real world HTTP proxies. I am attempting to do this without using a servlet container, to avoid unnecessary overhead in terms of library dependencies, and because the servlet API does not fit the usage patterns of a full duplex http tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of some restrictions that HTTP proxies impose that \"break\" some potential uses of the HTTP protocol:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTTP Pipelining may not be honoured beyond the connection between the client and the proxy. i.e. The proxy may send a single request and wait for the response before sending the next request, even if the client has dispatched multiple pipelined requests to the proxy.</li>\n<li>Chunked encoding may not be honoured beyond the connection between the proxy in a similar fashion: the server may send a response back in chunks, but the proxy may wait for the end chunk before dispatching the full, dechunked response to the client.</li>\n<li>HTTP CONNECT is often only allowed for SSL/TLS ports, typically only port 443, so this cannot be used as a sneaky way to get an unfettered TCP connection to the outside world.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However there is one additional possibility that I am not sure about: do real world HTTP proxies also share a persistent connection to a server between multiple clients? For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Client A sends requests A1, A2, and A3 to server X</li>\n<li>Client B sends requests B1 and B2 to server X</li>\n<li>Client C sends requests C1, C2 and C3 to server X</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would the proxy then potentially open a single connection to server X and send messages in the order:</p>\n\n<p>A1, A2, B1, C1, B2, A3, C2, C3</p>\n\n<p>or a similar order that preserves the ordering from each individual client, but potentially interleaved? Or even worse, could the proxy open multiple connections to the server and scatter messages from each client between the connections, i.e.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Connection 1: A1, C1, C2, C3\nConnection 2: B1, B2, A2, A3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If so, my approach requires more thought as I potentially need to demultiplex these messages into different queues for each tunnel, and cannot simply rely on identifying a connection as being used for a particular client.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of any good resources that describe the quirks of commonly used HTTP proxies and stateful inspecting firewalls?</p>\n"},{"tags":["django","http","redirect","amazon-s3","http-headers"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":4,"question_id":13159748,"title":"Do not propagate headers on HTTP redirects","body":"<p>I have files hosted on Amazon S3, and I'd like to download them after a treatment in my app. This app view requires the HTTP Authorization header to proceed.

I am not permitted to store my content on the <code>SD card</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My input data is essentially of an infinite length.  I tell <code>MediaPlayer</code> that its data source should basically be something like <code>\"http://localhost/myfile.mp3\"</code>.  I've a simple server set up that waits for <code>MediaPlayer</code> to make this request.  However, <code>MediaPlayer</code> isn't very cooperative.  At first, it makes an <code>HTTP GET</code> and tries to grab the whole file.  It times out if we try and simply dump data into the <code>socket</code> so we tried using the <code>HTTP</code> Range header to write data in chunks.  <code>MediaPlayer</code> doesn't like this and doesn't keep requesting the subsequent chunks.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had any success streaming data directly into <code>MediaPlayer</code>?  Do I need to implement an <code>RTSP</code> or <code>Shoutcast</code> server instead?  Am I simply missing a critical <code>HTTP header</code>?  What strategy should I use here?</p>\n\n<p>Rob Szumlakowski</p>\n\n<p>-- Later, I managed to solve the problem:</p>\n\n<p>The <code>HTTP</code> Server was indeed hosted on the phone itself.  It was very simple: just a <code>thread</code> listening on a socket for an <code>HTTP GET</code> request.  When it got the <code>HTTP</code> request, it would one a <code>new socket</code>, write back some <code>HTTP</code> headers and start dumping the <code>MP3</code> audio data back to the <code>socket</code>.  This <code>HTTP</code> server didn't do anything else.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Android Media Player</code> was playing the music as I was streaming to it.  The <code>Media Player</code> behaved very poorly if its playback <code>buffer</code> was emptied while it was playing audio.  It was very important for me to make sure my <code>HTTP</code> server kept writing data into that <code>socket</code>.\nI moved bytes into the socket in small chunks (10 kB). The headers on my <code>HTTP</code> response ended up looking like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Build response headers\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nsb.append( \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n\");\nsb.append( \"Content-Type: audio/mpeg\\r\\n\");\nsb.append( \"Connection: close\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Accept-Ranges: bytes\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Content-Length: \" + totalFileSize + \"\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Content-Disposition: inline; filename=xxxxx.mp3\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As long as I kept the pipe stoked, the <code>Android Media Player</code> kept consuming it without complaint.  Playing audio only required one request and response.  It ended up working pretty well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","http"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":82,"score":2,"question_id":13134019,"title":"http post method passing null values to the server","body":"<pre><code>         try \n         {\n\n            url= new URL(ConstantsClass.VENDOR_FOLLOW + \"?UID=\" +android_id+\"&amp;URL='\"+resultfinal+\"'&amp;device=android\");\n\n\n                connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n                connection.setDoOutput(true);\n                connection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\n\n                request = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream());\n                request.flush();\n                request.close();\n                request.write(\"Hello!!!\");\n\n                String line = \"\";\n                InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream());\n                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(isr);\n\n                StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n                while((line=reader.readLine())!=null) {\n                    sb.append(line + \"&amp;\");\n                }\n\n                response = sb.toString();\n                //response.getEntity().getContent();\n\n                Log.i(\"Test\", \"updated response: \" + response);\n\n\n\n            }\n         catch (IOException e) {\n              e.printStackTrace();\n          }\n\n            Log.i(\"Test\", \"**************url list********************\" + url);\n         tag_text.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n                public void onClick(View v) {\n                    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n                    Intent in=new Intent(context,LinkWebView.class);\n                    in.putExtra(\"vendorUrl\", resultfinal);\n                    context.startActivity(in);      \n                    //postData();\n                }\n            });\n             }\n\n    tag_text.setTextSize(16);\n    return view;\n\n}   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hi i am new to android and I am trying to pass values from the url to the server but i am getting null values passed on the server side.

I\nhave also tried with InputStream using getInputStream() with the same\nresults.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is tested on apache-tomcat-6.0.18.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","http","post","timeout"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6099,"score":6,"question_id":4896949,"title":"Android httpclient file upload data corruption and timeout issues","body":"<p>i'm having issues with uploading images in android.</p>\n\n<p>i'm using apache httpmime 4.1 lib\nthe code is like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MultipartEntity reqEntity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE);\n\nreqEntity.addPart(\"image\", new FileBody(new File(AndorraApplication.getPhotosPath() + \"/\" + entity.getFileName()), \"image/jpeg\"));\nresp = NetworkUtils.sendHttpRequestMultipart(EXPORT_PHOTOS_URI, reqEntity);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NetworkUtils class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class NetworkUtils {\n    public static final int REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT = 3 * 1000; \n    public static final int WAIT_TIMEOUT = 5 * 1000;\n\n    public static HttpResponse sendHttpRequestMultipart(String uri, MultipartEntity entity) {\n        HttpClient mHttpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();\n        final HttpParams params = mHttpClient.getParams();\n        HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(params, REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT);\n        HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(params, WAIT_TIMEOUT);\n        ConnManagerParams.setTimeout(params, WAIT_TIMEOUT);\n\n        HttpPost post = new HttpPost(uri);\n        post.addHeader(entity.getContentType());\n        post.setEntity(entity);\n        HttpResponse resp = mHttpClient.execute(post);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>sometimes everything works fine, but sometimes (especially on a slow connection) the image is uploaded very corrupted. the example is here: <a href=\"http://pixelbirthcloud.com/574_orig.jpg\">http://pixelbirthcloud.com/574_orig.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>it doesn't throw any exceptions. the lenght of the uploaded file is same as the original one.. tried to change mime type to application/octet-stream or remove it at all. tries playing with timeouts. still same result. end users upload corrupted images almost all the time (although i managed to get bronem images just 2 times only).. the image size was 2.5 megs at first, but then i reduced it to 500-700 kb. didn't fix the problem though. </p>\n\n<p>haven't tried to change the apache's library.. maybe it is the problem.. but as far as i read the net, nobody was experiencing this with httpmime library.</p>\n\n<p>what can it be?

However, the interesting this is that, on one testing server (EC2), it improves a lot and no more slow down.  HOwever, the other server (rackspace) only improves a bit.  It still shows slow down.  I even set \"Connection: close\" in the request header, it only improves 100ms. </p>\n\n<p>if http.request is using connection pooling, how to increase it?</p>\n\n<p>in both server, if I do \"ulimit -a\", the # of file open is 1024. </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** <strong>MORE AND MORE</strong> ** -------------------</p>\n\n<p>It seems that even I set maxSockets to higher number, it only works at some limit.  There seems to be a internal or OS dependent socket limitation.  However to bump it up? </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING ** ---------------</p>\n\n<p>After reading lots of post, I find out:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>quoted from: <a href=\"https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1) If I set the headers with connection = 'keep-alive', the performance is good and can go up to maxSocket = 1024 (which is my linux setting).  </p>\n\n<pre><code>var options1 = {\n                  host: 'www.google.com',\n                  port: 80,\n                  path: '/',\n                  method: 'GET',\n    **headers: {\n            'Connection':'keep-alive'\n    }**\n                };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I set it to \"Connection\":\"close\", the response time would be 100 times slower. </p>\n\n<p>Funny things happened here:</p>\n\n<p>1) in EC2, when I first test with Connection:keep-alive, it will take about 20-30 ms.  Then if I change to Connection:Close  OR set Agent:false, the response time will slow down to 300 ms. WIHTOUT restarting the server, if I change to Connection:keep-alive again, the response time will slow down even further to 4000ms.   Either I have to restart server or wait for a while to get back my 20-30ms lighting speed response.</p>\n\n<p>2) If I run it with agent:false, at first, the response time will slow down to 300ms.  But then, it will get faster again and back to \"normal\".   </p>\n\n<p>My guess is connection pooling still in effect even you set agent:false.

I'd like for it to work the same both ways, i.e. when copying files into the mapped drive, they shouldn't be copied into the Virtual Directory in <code>IIS</code>.

This has caused some issues with some of my company's SSRS 2008 reports.  While it is easy to simply use a higher value in order to get the reports to work I would like to know a bit more about how this works.  I understand this particular setting is HTTP thing, not strictly an SSRS thing, but this SSRS is the context of my investigation.  My aim is to derive some sort of way to calculate what the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys should be to cater for my reports, obviously looking at the worst case report which will have the greatest number of possible parameter values.</p>\n\n<p>So my main question is this - with respect to an SSRS report, what constitutes an item that is counted and compared to the setting MaxHTTPCollectionKeys?  Obviously there is some correlation to the total number of values from all parameters for a report, but how does this work exactly?</p>\n\n<p>I have made some test reports (using VS2008) and run them on my local 2008 R2 report server and found that the value of MaxHTTPCollectionKeys does not match exactly with the total number of parameter values passed at run-time.  One of my test reports contained only one multi-valued parameter of type INTEGER for which I defined a list of allowable values - ints 1 - 10.  I set the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 35 (in the report manager web config file.  Note - i reset the report server before performing my tests) and found that the report would run when i select six values (1 - 6, 2 - 7 - any combination of six) but not 7.  This suggests that 29 items are included in the collection before grabbing parameter values.  Further, I set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 30 and found that I could only select a single value for the parameter for the report to run.  When i set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 29 I could not run the report at all (multi-value parameters cannot be null).</p>\n\n<p>I then changed the report and found that by adding a second parameter (basically a copy of the first, multi-value int type with a list of ten ints) the base number rose from 29 to 30.  That is, when i set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 35 i could only select a total of five values between my two parameters (various combinations of the amount of items for each parameter didn't affect anything).</p>\n\n<p>I made a 3rd test report with no parameters at all (all the report contained was textbox which displayed the current time) and found that when MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 27 the report worked when it was 26 it did not work.</p>\n\n<p>To reiterate, my aim is to derive some sort of way to calculate what the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys should be to cater for my reports, obviously looking at the worst case report which will have the greatest number of possible parameter values.  Can anybody offer some guidelines to calculate this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","visual-studio-2010","http","rest"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13000835,"title":"I/P issue testing HTTP service on local computer","body":"<p>My development computer is assigned a local I/P of 192.168.2.7 on my LAN.</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://localhost</code> into a browser I get my computer's IIS screen as expected (running Win7).</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://192.168.2.7</code> into a browser I get my computer's IIS screen as expected.</p>\n\n<p>I have an HTTP service listening on port 50421.(Visual Studio)</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://localhost:50421</code> into a browser I get the proper response from my HTTP service</p>\n\n<p>if I enter <code>http://192.168.2.7:50421</code> into a browser both firefox and I.E. say they cannot connect.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this?

The idea is that Brazilians who are looking for flights from, say, SAO to REC by e.g. Google should have a higher chance of finding that particular flight search engine.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is probably replacing the fragment identifier (#) by a query string (?). The server then dynamically generates nice text content that can be viewed without JavaScript (search results would still be loaded via XHR). In my opinion, that makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to make the URLs more search engine friendly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(A) My customer proposes adding additional keywords into the URL, something like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com?flights+to+Porto+Alegre&amp;S%C3%A3o+Paulo+-+Todos+os+aeroportos+(SAO),+Brasil&amp;ao=Recife+-+Guararapes+Intl+(REC),+Brasil\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com?flights+to+Porto+Alegre&amp;S%C3%A3o+Paulo+-+Todos+os+aeroportos+(SAO),+Brasil&amp;ao=Recife+-+Guararapes+Intl+(REC),+Brasil</a></p></li>\n<li><p>(B) I propose adding a slug instead, which can easily be internationalized, and which is good to read also for humans. Example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com/pt_BR?ad=REC&amp;ao=SAO/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_para_Recife\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/pt_BR?ad=REC&amp;ao=SAO/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_para_Recife</a></p></li>\n<li><p>(C) Or, perhaps without a slug (but - due to parsability - only for a limited parameter set, which has the disadvantage of limiting sharing of URLs by users):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com/pt_BR/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_(SAO)_para_Recife_(REC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/pt_BR/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_(SAO)_para_Recife_(REC</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What do you suggest? Any examples of good URLs for similar use cases?</p>\n\n<p>That all being said: I understand that links from highly ranked pages are still the most important ranking measure. In the end, I wonder if all that complexity really is worth the effort. When I look at Google's own search pages, then they are rather simple. For example, there is no summary of the search query in a H1 tag, just as my customer wants.

Its part of a web application, but events have to be seen as soon as they occur. Long polling was not an option because it would be expensive for the webserver to hold on to connections, when no events are available. So i had to go for <code>Short-lived Polls</code>. <br><br>Each client hits the web server every say. 2 seconds (this is a fairly high rate). When events are available, they are sent as <code>JSON</code> to the JavaScript Client. Now, this requires a server set-up to handle high shot-lived connections. I have implemented one such system using <code>Yaws Web server</code>. However, because yaws starts quite a number of many other services, it feels heavy and connections begin to get either refused or aborted when they go beyond 30,000 (maybe because i am running some ETS Tables in the same Erlang VM as yaws is running on [ separating these may require <code>rpc:call/4</code>, which -- i fear -- will increase latency]). I know that there are Operating system specific tweaks to do, and those have been done.<br><br> This would not be a problem if it was easy to cluster up several yaws instances. In yaws, i am using a few appmods, and i am doing things <code>REST</code>-fully. I was thinking that <code>Cowboy Web server</code> might enhance things a bit here. I have not used Cowboy before, but i have used <code>Misultin</code>. Looking at Cowboy, it is a full fledged OTP Application and it seems to be easy to cluster, and being light weight, may perhaps increase on the number of clients the overall system can handle. Storage is on <code>Mnesia</code>, which i can distribute easilly to add more nodes (may be by replication), so that there is a <code>Cowboy</code> instance infront of every <code>Mnesia</code> instance.<br><br><b>Question 1: </b> Is my speculation correct, that if i switched from <code>Yaws</code> to <code>Cowboy</code>, i might increase the performance significantly ?<br><br><b>Question 2: </b> Yaws has a clean API via <code>Appmods</code> and the <code>#arg{}</code> record. Does <code>Cowboy</code> have an equivalent of these two things (illustrate please) ? <br><br><b> EDIT/ADDITIONS </b><hr> <b>Question 3: </b> Can <code>Cowboy</code> handle file uploads ? if so, which server (<code>Yaws</code> vs <code>Cowboy</code>), in your opinion would be better to use in-case of frequent file uploads ? illustrate how file uploads are done with <code>Cowboy</code>.<br><br> It is possible to run several yaws instances on the same machine, do you think that if i create many yaws instances per server (physical box), and have the client-load distributed across these, would help ? what do i need to know about doing this ? <br><br> When i set the <code>yaws.conf</code> parameter  <code>max_connections = nolimit</code>, how would i specify the same in Cowboy ?\n<br><br><b>Yet Another Edit</b><hr>\nNow, i followed the <a href=\"http://pdincau.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/an-interview-with-erlang-cowboy-loic-hoguin-lhoguin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interview with <code>Cowboy Author</code></a> and he discusses the reasons why Cowboy is more light weight than yaws. He says that, <code>\"The biggest difference is the use of binaries instead of lists. The generic acceptor pool is another. I could list a lot of other small differences but I figure these aren’t the most interesting.\"</code>. That because Cowboy uses the listener-pool library <a href=\"https://github.com/extend/ranch\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>Ranch</code></a>, it somehow ends up with a higher capability of handling more connections, plus the use of <code>Binaries</code> and not <code>Lists</code>.<br><br>Another quote from the same interview: <code>\"Since we use one process per connection instead of two, and we use binaries instead of lists, we end up using a lot less memory than other projects without user intervention. Cowboy is also lazy, it doesn’t do anything unless required. So we don’t have much in memory until the user starts calling functions.\"</code>. I wonder how yaws handles this case. Somehow, my problem domain needs light weight http handling. Its actually true that yaws will lead to more memory consumption as compared to say, <code>Mochiweb</code>, <code>Misultin</code> or <code>Cowboy</code>. My greatest concern is that, <code>Yaws</code> has the best/Cleanest <code>API</code> whereby it gives us access to the <code>#arg{}</code>, containing everything we need as an Erlang record, so that we can get them out ourselves, than the other which have numerous functions for extracting stuff outside. Even <code>Documentation</code>: Yaws docs are pretty good and straight forward. Perhaps, i need to look at more <code>CowBoy</code> Code for things like <code>File Upload</code>, simple <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> request handling. <br><br>Otherwise, the questions i asked earlier, remain as pressing concerns. Yaws, is pretty good, but seems an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overkill_%28term%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>OverKill</code></a> for this fast light-weight short-lived high rate poll situation, what do you think ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","get","nsarray"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":11527231,"title":"How to pass NSArray which is part of NSDictionary in http get method?","body":"<p>I want to pass an array to my server.

RFC 2616 has this to say on idempotence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Methods can also have the property of \"idempotence\" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. (RFC 2616 section 9.1.2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not clear on \"the side effects are the same\" qualifier. Does that mean it can be a repeat of the same side effect, or a net-0 effect?</p>\n\n<p>And then...  we've been allowing forward revisions, that is, creating a new version that is not yet the default version, but will be. How does that play into idempotence and PUT? If a new revision is created, then repeating the PUT is not a no-op. Rather, it would create yet another revision. The spec says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example, an article might have a URI for identifying \"the current version\" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in several other URIs being defined by the origin server</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Put another way:</p>\n\n<p><code>PUT /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p>\n\n<p>Results in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>GET /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p></li>\n<li><p><code>GET /node/5/revision/8 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And that's totally fine, by my read of the spec. However, what of:</p>\n\n<p><code>PUT /node/5 {title: \"Bonjour le monde\"}</code></p>\n\n<p>Results in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>GET /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></li>\n<li><code>GET /node/5/revision/8 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></li>\n<li><code>GET /node/5/revision/9 {title: \"Bonjour le monde\"}</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is that still spec-valid behavior? And if not, does that mean that any system that uses a Create-Read-Archive-Purge (CRAP) model instead of CRUD, or that supports forward revisioning, is inherently not-PUT-compatible? </p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","svn","http","svn-hooks"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":265,"score":0,"question_id":3027117,"title":"post commit hook fail","body":"<p>I have Master/Slave setup using Win2k8R with SVN 1.6.9 and using TortoiseSVN 1.6.7. \nThe access is through Apache and using http.\nEverything works but when I commit I get the following message:\nError: post-commit hook failed (exit code 1) with output:<br>\nError: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. \nThis happen when using multiple TortoiseSVN dialog for committing the files in rapid succession.

Is there a better way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gareth's answer is pretty good, but I would still like an answer from someone familiar with Rails 2 (because of its unique CookieSessionStore).</p>"},{"tags":["ruby","http","tcp","apachebench"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":12947510,"title":"Why ApacheBench considers HTTP response failed (two times)?","body":"<p>I've taken a basic Ruby http server from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/7044459/513342\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It does seem to produce valid HTTP response:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 14 Dec 2010 10:48:45 GMT\nServer: Ruby\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Length: 17\n\n&lt;html&gt;amit&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm doing a simple ApacheBench test against it:</p>\n\n<p><code>ab -r -n 10 -c 1 http://localhost:2000/</code></p>\n\n<p>It produces weird results:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Complete requests:      10</p>\n  \n  <p>Failed requests:        20</p>\n  \n  <p>(Connect: 0, Receive: 10, Length: 0, Exceptions: 10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can't figure out why.</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","caching","http-headers"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":12946812,"title":"How I can use the HTTP headers to indicate in the Response that possibility?","body":"<p>Finally I accomplished to cache dynamic images, css, and javascript files using HTTP headers BUT I have a problem now:</p>\n\n<p>I have specific dynamic images that are equal but has different URL's.</p>\n\n<p>For example: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://example.com/image/src/the-same-image.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/image/src/the-same-image.jpg</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://example.com/image/custom/src/the-same-image2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/image/custom/src/the-same-image2.jpg</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>1 and 2 has the same file content but different URL.

I can submit a form pointing to <a href=\"http://other-site.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://other-site.com/</a>, but then the body won't be raw JSON - it'll be form data.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to ask the other department to change their API, but I want to make sure of this before I do.</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","parsing","email","rest","authentication"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":2,"question_id":12843313,"title":"Parsing a HTTP Basic authentication with an email containing a colon character ( ':' )","body":"<p>I'm using the Authorization header with the Basic type for authentication. \nI'm following the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTP Basic authentication specifications</a> which states that the credentials should follow this form -> userIdentifier:password encoded in base64</p>\n\n<p>We are using an email as the user identifier and according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address\" rel=\"nofollow\">email format specification</a>, the colon(':') character is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>The colon(':') is also a valid character in the password. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing this, I'm looking for a creative way to parse the credentials part of the header that uses a colon(':') as the separator between userID and password. </p>\n\n<p>In this case it's simple -> francis@gmail.com:myPassword</p>\n\n<p>This is where it gets complicated -> francis@gmail.com:80:myPasswordWith:Inside</p>\n\n<p>francis@gmail.com:80 is a valid email according to the email format specification even though this is not used very often.

This gets complicated.</p>\n\n<p>If the data is valid and the user is expecting html, you want to issue a redirect so that refreshing doesn't cause them to re-post.

If they are not expecting html, you can simply return 200 OK.</p>\n\n<p>If the data is invalid and the user is expecting html, you want to re-render the page they came from, with a visible error, so that they can re-post.  To do this, you'd have to run the previous action, and make it aware of the error message.  To decide which was the previous action, perhaps you included that as a hidden parameter in the form.  If they are not expecting html, you can return an applicable 4xx client error. </p>\n\n<p>I find myself doing this silly dance far too many times.

Stuff the error data in the session for a split second between requests, and then clear it, just like the success message.  That way, valid and invalid posts can be handled the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Idea 2: Don't do any normal HTTP posts.  Only use ajax.  Now you don't have to worry about rendering or redirecting at all.

I have used a >2G mp4 video file for my tests and was capturing packets with Wireshark.

No new HTTP request is sent (unless the video is fast forwarded to a certain position). Streaming code chunk for this is quite simple, it reads <code>RandomAccessFile input</code> and writes to <code>OutputStream output</code> via <code>byte[] buffer</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ((read = input.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n    output.write(buffer, 0, read);\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>iPad 1\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP GET request for file comes, asking for byte range <code>[0; &lt;almost the end of the file&gt;]</code></li>\n<li>server responds, starts to stream the file</li>\n<li>iPad gets a chunk or two and then unilaterally decides to stop accepting bytes from the server and issues a <strong>separate <code>GET</code> request</strong> for the next chunk of the file. New range boundaries are e.g. <code>[100, almost the end of the file]</code>. The video is shown OK.</li>\n<li>cycle repeats again from step 2. Left boundary always moves towards the end of the file.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn't investigate how exactly the connection is terminated. It could be that iPad stops sending TCP ACK packets, I suppose this doesn't really matter that much.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that for every terminated connection I get <code>java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe</code> exception. This not only pollutes the logs (which is a minor/solvable problem) but I believe this can hurt performance as raising exceptions is quite expensive. When watching simple video, the exception rate was around 1 exception/sec, but if the server had 100 concurrent users, then the JVM would probably be spending loads of time just calculating stack traces instead of doing real work.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tested this on iPhone using iOS 6 and was able to observe the same behaviour as iPad 1.

IMO the latter seems more preferable although to some it might make the client code more complex. The spec supports named events (events that relate to a particular topic), which to me suggests that a Server-Sent Events connection should be used as single channel for all events.</p>\n\n<p>The following code illustrates the first scenario where a multiple Server-Sent Event connections are initiated:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventSource eventSource1 = new EventSource(\"events/topic1\");\neventSource1.addEventListener('topic1', topic1Listener, false);\n\nvar EventSource eventSource2 = new EventSource(\"events/topic2\");\neventSource2.addEventListener('topic2', topic2Listener, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>eventSource1 would receive \"topic1\" events and eventSource2 would receive \"topic2\" events. Whilst this is pretty straight forward it is also pretty inefficient with a hanging GET occurring for each topic you are interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative is something like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventSource eventSource3 = new EventSource(\"/events?id=1234\")\neventSource3.addEventListener('topic3', topic3Listener, false);\neventSource3.addEventListener('topic4', topic4Listener, false);\n\nvar subscription = new XMLHttpRequest();\nsubscription.open(\"PUT\", \"/events/topic3?id=1234\", true);\nsubscription.send();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example a single EventSource would exist and interest in a particular event would be specified by a separate request with the Server-Sent Event connection and the registration being correlated by the id param. topic3Listener would receive \"topic3\" events and topic4Listener would not. Whilst requiring slightly more code the benefit is that only a single connection is made, but events can be still be identified and handled differently.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number examples on the web that show the use of named events, but it seems the event names (or topics) are known in advance so there is no need for a client to register interest with the server (<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/06/a-wall-powered-by-eventsource-and-server-sent-events/\">example</a>). Whilst I am yet to see an example showing multiple EventSource objects, I also haven't seen an example showing a client using a separate request to register interest in a particular topic, as I am doing above. My interpretation of the spec leads me to believe that indicating an interest in a certain topic (or event name) is entirely up to the developer and that it can be done statically with the client knowing the names of the events it is going to receive or dynamically with the client alerting the server that it is interested in receiving particular events.</p>\n\n<p>I would be pretty interested in hearing other people's thoughts on the topic.

(Even though ASP.Net thinks that the content-length is 0)</p>\n\n<p>I use this code for setting it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpRequest r; .... \nif(r.Headers.AllKeys.Contains(\"Content-Length\")){\n    r.Headers[\"Content-Length\"]=length.ToString();\n}else{\n    r.AddHeader(\"Content-Length\",length.ToString());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This runs fine on mod_mono+Apache and on Mono's implementation of <code>xsp</code>, however, on Microsoft's Cassini dev server, this produces a PlatformNotSupportedException with the text <code>This operation requires IIS integrated pipeline mode.</code></p>\n\n<p>Are there any known workarounds for this issue? </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","http","https","connection-pooling","typhoeus"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":12559575,"title":"Typhoeus does not close https connections","body":"<p>I'm using Typhoeus to handle all of the HTTP calls to external APIs on my site, and it's been working beautifully up until recently. My Rails site started to be unresponsive after a while. I noticed that there're a ton of connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state when I do a netstat, and they're generated by the following piece of code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  requests = []\n  hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new\n  urls.each_with_index do |url, index|\n    request = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, :timeout =&gt; 5000)\n    request.on_complete do |response|\n      begin\n        resp = JSON.parse(response.body)\n\n        if resp[\"error\"]\n          p \"no deal found for #{factual_ids[index]}\"\n          { :deals =&gt; nil }\n        else\n          { :deals =&gt; resp[\"merchant\"][\"deals\"] }\n        end\n      rescue Exception =&gt; e\n        p e.message\n        { :deals =&gt; nil }\n      end\n    end\n\n    requests &lt;&lt; request\n    hydra.queue(request)\n  end\n\n  hydra.run\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only thing that I find different than how I am using Typhoeus in my other HTTP calls is that the urls above are all HTTPS urls.

Is there a option I can pass into Typheous to force close the connection once it's finished?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","servlets","post","multipartform-data","jboss-4.0.x"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12315250,"title":"Method Not Implemented Error Jboss4 - Unsupported for \"multipart/form-data\"","body":"<p>I have been  unable to get a solution from within SO hence posting.</p>\n\n<p>I have a sample JSP page that is posting to a vendor product that implements and image upload facility.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nfunction upload(){\ndocument.forms[0].enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"\ndocument.forms[0].action=\"/upload\"\ndocument.forms[0].submit()\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After posting the form  while monitoring the request I am getting the following response and the servlet is defaulting to processing the input with content type = <code>\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"</code></p>\n\n<p>These are the request headers:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>POST /upload HTTP/1.1\nAccept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/x-ms-application, application/x-ms-xbap, application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument, application/xaml+xml, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, */*\nReferer: http://localhost:9001/ansHealthConsole/htmljsp/common/reattach_file.jsp?JOBNAME=RESCAN_IMAGES&amp;RFCNAME=READ&amp;SEQNUM=100041767&amp;SESSIONID=62767&amp;SECURETXNID=7309450930646918658&amp;\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------7dc3c0d25050c\nUA-CPU: x86\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: localhost:9001\nContent-Length: 71671\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The response headers are as follows:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nX-Powered-By: Servlet 2.4; Tomcat-5.0.28/JBoss-4.0.1 (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_1 date=200412230944)\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 989\nDate: Fri, 07 Sep 2012 06:13:34 GMT\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nConnection: close\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am unable to debug whether the <code>\"multipart/--\"</code> is not supported within the Tomcat of Jboss 4 or I have some other error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","google-app-engine","http","afnetworking"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12757039,"title":"My app fails to connect to the server some times","body":"<p>I've been helplessly observing this problem for a couple months now, and have decided this is my best shot. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what the cause of the problem is, but I can list some of the things I'm doing.

After the failed request, I try again, and it works fine. It works fine for the whole day. And then another time randomly the issue repeats itself, sometimes spinning for 10 seconds with a fail, or a minute. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, what can possibly be the cause of this? Is it normal to have some failed connections randomly? Is that something on my part?</p>\n\n<p>But the weird thing is, is that while on my iPhone the app is running, and the indicator is spinning, and it's trying to connect, I try connecting on the iOS simulator, and the connection works just fine.

So it sounds like it may be a software issue rather than connection issue, but then again I have no evidence or data what so ever.</p>\n\n<p>I know it's vague, but I'm hoping someone may have had a similar problem.

There had two issues on the proxy client side I couldn't resolve for long time. Hope someone can point out the root causes based on following scenarios. Thanks a lot. :D</p>\n\n<p>The HTTP proxy I built right now is somehow work partially only. For example, I could access google's main page through proxy while I couldn't get any search result after I typed keyword(the google instant is also not working at all). On the other hand, youtube is working perfectly includes searching, loading video and commenting. What's more, there also got some websites like yahoo even couldn't display main page after I keyed in its URL. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why I said the issues are on the proxy client side at the begining is because I traced the data flow of my program. I found out the written size returned by socket programming function write() was smaller than the data size I passed to my write back function. The most weird observation for me was the data losing issue is independent from the size of data. The socket write() function could work properly for youtube video data which is nearly 2MB while it would loss data for google search request which is just 20KB. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there also had another situation that browser displayed blank when the data size I passed to my write back function and the written size returned by socket write function() are the same. I used wireshark to trace the flow of communication and compared mine with pure IP communication without proxy involved. I found out that browser didn't continuously send out HTTP requests after it received certain HTTP responses comparing with pure IP communication flow.

The problem I'm running into is how to handle the <code>GET</code> operation on the collection root if the collection is large.</p>\n\n<p>As an example pretend I'm exposing StackOverflow's <code>Questions</code> table where each row is exposed as a document (not that there necessarily is such a table, just a concrete example of a sizable collection of 'documents'). The collection would be made available at <code>/db/questions</code> with the usual CRUD api <code>GET /db/questions/XXX</code>, <code>PUT /db/questions/XXX</code>, <code>POST /db/questions</code> is in play. The standard way to get the entire collection is to <code>GET /db/questions</code> but if that naively dumps each row as a JSON object, you'll get a rather sizeable download and a lot of work on the part of the server. </p>\n\n<p>The solution is, of course, paging. Dojo has solved this problem in its <a href=\"http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/data/JsonRestStore#id7\" rel=\"nofollow\">JsonRestStore</a> via a clever RFC2616-compliant extension of using the <code>Range</code> header with a custom range unit <code>items</code>. The result is a <code>206 Partial Content</code> that returns only the requested range. The advantage of this approach over a query parameter is that it leaves the query string for...queries (e.g. <code>GET /db/questions/?score&gt;200</code> or somesuch, and yes that'd be encoded <code>%3E</code>).</p>\n\n<p>This approach completely covers the behavior I want. The problem is that <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616\" rel=\"nofollow\">RFC 2616</a> specifies that on a 206 response (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <strong>request</strong> MUST have included a Range header field (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.35\" rel=\"nofollow\">section 14.35</a>)\n    indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range\n    header field (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.27\" rel=\"nofollow\">section 14.27</a>) to make the request conditional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes sense in the context of the standard usage of the header but is a problem because I'd like the 206 response to be the default to handle naive clients/random people exploring.</p>\n\n<p>I've gone over the RFC in detail looking for a solution but have been unhappy with my solutions and am interested in SO's take on the problem. </p>\n\n<p>Ideas I've had:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Return <code>200</code> with a <code>Content-Range</code> header!</em> - I don't think that this is wrong, but I'd prefer if a more obvious indicator that the response is only Partial Content.</li>\n<li><em>Return <code>400 Range Required</code></em> - There is not a special 400 response code for required headers, so the default error has to be used and read by hand. This also makes exploration via web browser (or some other client like Resty) more difficult.</li>\n<li><em>Use a query parameter</em> - The standard approach, but I'm hoping to allow queries a la Persevere and this cuts into the query namespace.</li>\n<li><em>Just return <code>206</code>!</em> - I think most clients wouldn't freak out, but I'd rather not go against a MUST in the RFC</li>\n<li><em>Extend the spec! Return <code>266 Partial Content</code></em> - Behaves exactly like 206 but is in response to a request that MUST NOT contain the <code>Range</code> header. I figure that 266 is high enough that I shouldn't run into collision issues and it makes sense to me but I'm not clear on whether this is considered taboo or not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'd think this is a fairly common problem and I'd like to see this done in a sort of de facto fashion so I or someone else isn't reinventing the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way to expose a full collection via HTTP when the collection is large?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","iis7","dynamic","compression","http-compression"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2874,"score":12,"question_id":4662764,"title":"Dynamic Compression not working IIS 7.5","body":"<p>I currently have both static and dynamic compression configured.

Let's call it <code>A</code>. I've got another (read-only) HTTP resource whose contents \nare a subset of the contents <code>A</code> that I'll call <code>A(b)</code>. The HTTP response for a GET of <code>A(b)</code> includes a \n<code>Content-Location</code> header that resolves to <code>A</code>. I've got another (read/write) resource whose contents\nare also a subset of the contents of <code>A</code> that I'll call <code>A(c)</code>. When a POST, PUT, or DELETE is applied \nto <code>A(c)</code> the response contains a <code>Content-Location</code> header that resolves to <code>A</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is about the cacheing behavior. It's pretty clear from <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-13.10\" rel=\"nofollow\">RFC 2616, Section 13.10</a>\nthat a POST, PUT, or DELETE to <code>A(c)</code> will invalidate the cache entry for <code>A</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Some HTTP methods MUST cause a cache to invalidate an entity. This is\n  either the entity referred to by the Request-URI, or by the Location\n  or Content-Location headers (if present). These methods are:\n\n     - PUT\n\n     - DELETE\n\n     - POST\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But does a POST, PUT, or DELETE to <code>A(c)</code> also invalidate the cache entry for <code>A(b)</code>? My intuition says\nthat it <em>should</em>, based on my interpretation of the nature of the <code>Content-Location</code> header, but it's \nhard to definitively determine that from on the spec. And even if it <em>should</em> behave this way, does it\nactually <em>work</em> that way in browsers and other cacheing hardware and software?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","httpresponse","http-status-codes","http-status-code-403"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":832,"score":0,"question_id":1270759,"title":"Difference between http response status code 402 and 403","body":"<p>Friends and fellow users,</p>\n\n<p>We have both 402 and 403 http response codes.

I am trying to upload a ByteArray from memory via POST to a server. I'm using the URLRequest class to send the data, and URLLoader because I want to monitor the progress. The relevant sections of code follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var uploadRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://127.0.0.1/upload.php\");\nuploadRequest.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\nuploadRequest.contentType = \"multipart/form-data\";\nuploadRequest.data = myByteArray;\n\nvar uploader:URLLoader = new URLLoader;\nuploader.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onUploadProgress);\nuploader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onUploadComplete);\nuploader.dataFormat = URLLoaderDataFormat.BINARY;\nuploader.load(uploadRequest);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that I've set my callbacks to trace the upload progress, and the bytesTotal property of the ProgressEvent is always 1960 (the size of the request minus data?), even though the actual data is around 20MB and no file is uploaded even after the Complete event fires.</p>\n\n<p>I've verified that upload.php functions correctly with a simple html form, and I can verify that myByteArray contains all of the data in question. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've attempted a couple of new things that I thought I should mention. The first is setting the content type to application/octet-stream instead of multipart/form-data, which had no effect other than increasing the number of bytes to 1964. I also checked the Apache error log and found the following text repeated a lot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PHP Warning:  Missing boundary in multipart/form-data POST data in Unknown on line 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm guessing that Flash isn't formatting the HTTP request properly for whatever reason. Given that I created a FileReference that makes use of the same methods I set for the URLLoader to upload a file from disk, and got the expected result: the bytesTotal property matched the file size and the file was uploaded correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Working from that I found a page in the Adobe developer docs that mentions uploading data to a server using FileReference.upload() by setting the data parameter of the URLRequest, so I tried the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var uploadRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://127.0.0.1/upload.php\");\nuploadRequest.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\nuploadRequest.data = myByteArray;\n\nfileRef = new FileReference;\nfileRef.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onUploadProgress);\nfileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onUploadComplete);\nfileRef.upload(uploadRequest);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which resulted in the following output:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ArgumentError: Error #2127: FileReference POST data cannot be type ByteArray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm really stuck here.

I have about 300 different data feeds as xml formatted files served from 50 data providers. Each file is between 100kb and 5mb in size. I need to poll them frequently (as in once every few minutes) to determine if any of them has new data I need to process. So it is important that the downloader uses http caching to minimize the amount of data to fetch. It also uses gzip compression obviously. </p>\n\n<p>Then the big problem is how to use the bandwidth in an as efficient manner as possible without overstepping any boundaries. For example, one data provider may consider it abuse if you open 20 simultaneous connections to their data feeds. Instead it may be better to use one or two connections that are reused for multiple files. Or your own connection may be limited in strange ways.. My isp limits the number of dns lookups you can do so some kind of dns caching would be nice.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","http","streaming","jpeg","mjpeg"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12529006,"title":"how set parameter stream st in mjpeg","body":"<p>i try write mjpeg stream and i found good example : <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1595945/creating-my-own-mjpeg-stream/12527791#12527791\">creating my own MJPEG stream</a> </p>\n\n<p>I want to understand how to set the parameter \"Stream st\" that is used above example </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"Stream st\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","http","http-server"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7411,"score":6,"question_id":3732109,"title":"simple HTTP server in Java using only Java SE API","body":"<p>Is there a way to create a very basic HTTP server (supporting only GET/POST) in Java using just the Java SE API, without writing code to manually parse HTTP requests and manually format HTTP responses?

I'm not sure how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>The terminal output here stops at \"Finished.\" It doesn't print \"Started over,\" but nor does it print \"Exited while loop.\" So I can't figure out where it's getting stuck, or how to properly conclude the connection so that after loading Google I can actually initiate a Google search, or load Gmail, or anything. </p>\n\n<pre><code>while( (n = read(sock, buffer2, 1024 ) ) &gt;= 1)\n  {\n      printf(\"Started over: %i :(\\n\\n\", n);\n\n      buffer2[n] = '\\0';\n      printf( \"Rcvd message from server: \\n\\n----\\n\\n%s\\n\\n----\\n\\n\", buffer2 );\n      n = write( newsock, buffer2, strlen( buffer2 ) );\n\n      printf(\"\\n\\nFinished.\\n\\n\");\n  }\n\n  close( sock );\n  printf(\"\\n\\nExited while loop.\\n\\n\");\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","ios","api","http","mobile"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":12408864,"title":"Is it a good idea to use HTTP 5xx status codes in API?","body":"<p>I'm building API for mobile devices and have to decide how to send back application-specific errors.

It seems that certain websites, however, can detect the original (host) IP address. I've investigated the issue a bit and here's what I found.</p>\n\n<p>There are four proxy methods I've tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox with a proxy setting.</li>\n<li>Python with <code>mechanize.set_proxies</code>.</li>\n<li>Firefox in a virtual machine using an internal network, along with another virtual machine acting as a router (having two adapters: a NAT, and that internal network), set up such that the internal network traffic is routed through a proxy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorBrowser</a> (which uses Firefox as the actual browser).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the first three I used the same proxy. The Tor option was just for additional testing, not via my own proxy. The following things are behaviors I've noticed that are expected:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With all of these, if I go to <code>http://www.whatismyip.com/</code>, it gives the correct IP address (the IP address of the proxy, not the host computer).</li>\n<li><code>whatismyip.com</code> says \"No Proxy Detected\" for all of these.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indeed, it seems like the websites I visit do think my IP is that of the proxy. However, there have been a few weird cases which makes me think that some sites can somehow detect my original IP address.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In one situation, visiting a non-US site via Firefox with a non-US proxy, the site literally was able to print my originating IP address (from the US) and deny me access. Shouldn't this be impossible? Visiting the site via the virtual machine with that same non-US proxy, or the TorBrowser with a non-US exit node, though, the site was unable to do so.</li>\n<li>In a similar situation, I was visiting another non-US site from a non-US proxy. If I logged into the site from Firefox within the virtual machine, or from the TorBrowser with a non-US exit node, the site would work properly. However, if I attempted to log in via Firefox with a proxy (the same proxy the virtual machine uses), or with <code>mechanize</code>, it would fail to log in with an unrelated error message.</li>\n<li>In a third situation, using the <code>mechanize.set_proxies</code> option, I overloaded a site with too many requests so it decided to block access (it would purposefully time out whenever I logged in). I thought it might have blocked the proxy's IP address. However, when I ran the code from a different host machine, but with the same proxy, it worked again, for a short while, until they blocked it again. (No worries, I won't be harassing the site any further - I re-ran the program as I thought it might have been a glitch on my end, not a block from their end.) Visiting that site with the Firefox+proxy solution from one of the blocked hosts also resulted in the purposeful timeout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems to me that all of these sites, in the Firefox + proxy and <code>mechanize</code> cases, were able to find out something about the host machine's IP address, whereas in the TorBrowser and virtual machine cases, they weren't. </p>\n\n<p>How are the sites able to gather this information? What is different about the TorBrowser and virtual machine cases that prevents the sites from gathering this information? And, how would I implement my python script so that the sites I'm visiting via the proxy can't detect the host/host's IP address?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","jmeter"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":938,"score":0,"question_id":8798273,"title":"use csv parameters in jmeter httprequest path","body":"<p>I want to use CSV Data Set Config to modify the path of a HTTP Request.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My CSV file:\n<pre>\n120,120\n121,121\n</pre></li>\n<li>My CSV variable names: <code>paraa, parab</code>.</li>\n<li>My http request path: <code>/my/path/with/?{paraa}/?{parab}/</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I tried and I failed.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyway to work this around?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","http"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12391915,"title":"IllegalStateException: getInputStream() is not available.

And it got me thinking that perhaps this was because my question was nonsensical.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of http is that a client (typical a browser) sends a request (get) to a server, in my case IIS. Part of this request is the accept-encoding header, which indicates to the server what type of encoding the client would like the resource returned in. Typically this could include gZip. And if the server is set up correctly it will return the resource requested in the requested encoding. </p>\n\n<p>The response will include a Content-Encoding header indicating what compression has been applied to the resource. Also included in the response is the Content-Type header which indicates the mime type of the resource.

(There are also other examples I found but they use <code>java.net</code> networking package (like <code>URLConnection</code>) which is tedious so I don't want to use them). </p>\n\n<p>But it's also my requirement to use <code>Spring</code> and <code>JMS</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I know from <code>Spring</code>'s <a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/remoting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference</a> that it's possible to combine <code>HttpClient</code>, <code>JMS</code> and <code>Spring</code>. My question is, how? </p>\n\n<p>Note that it's <strong><code>NOT</code></strong> in my requirement to use <code>HttpClient</code>. If you have a better suggestion, I'm welcome. </p>\n\n<p>Appreciate it. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For your reference, here's the XML-over-HTTP example I've been talking about: </p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n * $Header: \n * $Revision$\n * $Date$\n * ====================================================================\n *\n *  Copyright 2002-2004 The Apache Software Foundation\n *\n *  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n *  you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n *  You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n *  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n *  distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n *  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n *  See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n *  limitations under the License.\n * ====================================================================\n *\n * This software consists of voluntary contributions made by many\n * individuals on behalf of the Apache Software Foundation.

The ESRI ArcGIS javascript API uses something that's commonly referred to as an \"ArcGIS Server proxy\" to forward requests to a ArcGIS Server Service that requires token-based authentication or are too long to be handled directly within the URL. The AGS proxy simply makes an HTTP request to a URL that's passed to it, forwarding any additional parameter that's passed along with the original request to the ArcGIS Server Service, which does the actual heavy lifting and responds with JSON.  For more information regarding the AGS proxy, please refer to the following <a href=\"http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/help/jshelp_start.htm#jshelp/ags_proxy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">page</a> on the ArcGIS Resource Center.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the AGS proxy is only provided by ESRI in ASP.Net, Java and PHP flavors, I've taken the liberty of writing an AGS proxy as a Rails controller.  I've opted to take this approach because the JSAPI doesn't support cross-domain requests and for hosting reasons I don't want to serve PHP within my Rails app or run my app on top of JRuby.  My Rails AGS proxy works in all circumstances I've encountered so far except for multipart requests, which occur with the Attachment Editor functionality, which is illustrated <a href=\"http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/help/jssamples/ed_attachments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my attempts at making multipart requests work, I've opted to use Faraday for making HTTP requests to the ArcGIS Server Service because of Faraday's simplicity and support for multipart requests.  My code that attempts to do multipart requests is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Configure the request\nuri = URI.parse(url)\nconn = Faraday.new(:url =&gt; (\"http://\" + uri.host.downcase)) do |faraday|\n  faraday.request :multipart\n  faraday.request :url_encoded\n  faraday.response :logger\n  faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter\nend\n\n# Make request\nresponse = conn.post uri.path do |req|\n  req.body = agsparams\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The \"agsparams\" variable is a hash of parameters that's being passed to ArcGIS Server.</p>\n\n<p>When attempting to execute this code, Ruby errors on the line where the actual request is being made with the following error, which is where I'm currently stuck:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NoMethodError (undefined method `local_path' for #ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007ffbe198fe60\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I dump the params hash in the controller, it looks similar to the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n   \"attachment\"=&gt;#ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007ffbe198fe60\n   @original_filename=\"test_image.jpg\",\n   @content_type=\"image/jpeg\",\n   @headers=\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"attachment\\\"; filename=\\\"test_image.jpg\\\"\\r\\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\\r\\n\",\n   @tempfile=#File:/var/folders/mh/2mfy5nr54gngrzg06gzp1jcw0000gn/T/RackMultipart20120718-2772-xwbgjy,\n   \"f\"=&gt;\"json\",\n   \"http://arcgisserver.com/arcgis/rest/services/multitenant/test_organization/FeatureServer/0/4808/addAttachment\"=&gt;nil\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(I removed some brackets so that this will display on StackOverflow.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know where the \"local_path\" method is being called as I'm not calling it but my guess is that this is some sort of built-in functionality that's associated with ActionDispatch that I don't understand.  Is there a method in ActionDispatch that I need to override, if so, how do I do that?  I have a hunch that ActionDispatch is making an attempt at uploading the file that I specify when I really just want to forward the file input parameters to ArcGIS Server so that ArcGIS Server does the upload.  I don't think I want to use Faraday::UploadIO as I think I just need to forward parameters to ArcGIS Server, but I could be wrong. Where do I go from here??</p>\n\n<p>As some additional due-diligence I've confirmed that my mapping javascript works with other flavors of the AGS proxy; I've also inspected working multipart proxy requests with Wireshark and have compared those requests with requests being made with my Rails AGS proxy and they seem consistent (the headers and params look right).  The data that I'm attempting to add attachments to is in fact configured properly to accept attachments.  I'm stuck and really could use some help.</p>\n\n<p>A little about my environment: My app is written in Rails 3.2 on Ruby 1.9.2 (I currently use CarrierWave and Fog to handle attachments on other non-mapping parts of the app, if that matters at all).

In many countries, including Vietnam, google automatically redirects to a localized version (e.g. <a href=\"http://google.com.vn\" rel=\"nofollow\">google.com.vn</a>), the one I can't actually read so I scan it in a desperate attempt to find <em>Google.com in English</em> link. </p>\n\n<p>The first time it happened I was puzzled and spent some time finding out what could be wrong with my request headers; as I expected, my <code>Accept-Language</code> is always <code>en-US</code> or something like <code>en-US,ru;q=0.5</code>. Further tests with different IPs confirmed that they do IP geolocation, even when you are logged in. Later I learned there is a language query <code>?hl=...</code>, but still.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question would be: do you think this is reasonable and expected behavior, webculture-wise? Do other sites do it too? <strong>If you were to design a multilanguage site what would you do with a person who comes from <code>.vn</code> IP but with <code>en-US</code> language?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I imagine there are different approaches to IP geolocation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>contra</strong>: I think this is impolite: I tell you explicitly what I want, \nwhat's good about giving me something else?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>pro</strong>: It could be that a person has just installed browser with the default language pack, without any idea about <code>Accept-*</code> headers, and still would prefer to see localized version of a website.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>contra</strong>: And yet, non-techie people can easily change accept-language by installing a language pack. In fact, if you go to download Firefox, chances are you'll download the one in the language you want, with the accept-language header that respects your wishes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that I read the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTP 1.1 specification</a> from 1999 but they seem to omit the question of how much the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>Accept-Language</code></a> should be really taken into consideration.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this question belongs to SO as a web-app design question.

I also saw that, even when no calls were being made to the server (and the process was no paused), the .connections field would never zero out.

We are trying to send high volumes data from the devices which record the data to a server so they can be processed in a database. The guy developing the firmware seems to think that the best way to send the data is to produce CSV files and send them via FTP. A program on the server needs to monitor the files received via FTP and run a PHP script to process them. I, however, feel that the best way of sending the data is via HTTP POST.</p>\n\n<p>We had HTTP POST working and then I began trying to work with the CSVs which became a pain as reliably monitoring the files received via FTP meant editing the ProFTPD configuration file (which I found to be a near impossible task) and install a package called mod_exec (which comes with security risks) so that ProFTPD could run a PHP script. These issues and the fact that I am unfamiliar with the linux console which I am required to use extensively to set this up, makes the CSV method very difficult to set up. HTTP POST to me seems like a more direct way of sending the data without having to worry about files or relying on ProFTPD. It would also allow us to use identifiers to give the data being passed meaning as opposed to a string of values for which the meaning is not immediately apparent. In addition, the query string could be URL encoded to pass a multidimensional array which would work well given the type of data being passed.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, just because the HTTP POST method would be easier doesn't mean that the CSV method doesn't have advantages. Furthermore, the firmware guy has far more experience than me with computers so I trust his opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Can you please help me to understand his point of view on the advantages of the CSV method and explain what the best method is?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","testing","post","apache-commons","multipartform-data"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":367,"score":0,"question_id":11437810,"title":"How to test multipart/form-data POST request","body":"<p>I am trying to find a tool that will allow me to test a multipart/form-data POST request and tweak the request.
