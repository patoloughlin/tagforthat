Its simpler smaller and it seems to work fine in FireFox!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>\n1.What are the pros and cons of using protocollless Urls?<br>\n2.Why aren't other folks using them?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks! Very curious to your insights.  Much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","objective-c","ios","http","post"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13250419,"title":"Error in AFHTTPClient POST","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a http post to a web server in an iPhone App with AFHTTPClient.

Here's the weird thing: When I take a URL constructed with this code and put it directly into my browser window, the server does its job even if there is a space in the value. So this URL sent from my script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://[ip]/setsetting/setting1=value 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does not work, but if I plug that same url into my browser (Chrome), it does work.

The REST service returns a String which is then placed onto a JMS queue using the request-response pattern. The idea is that the String placed on the queue will be consumed by some consumer and a reponse will created using the Reply-To address. So basically this is implimenting synchronous JMS.</p>\n\n<p>The flow works as expected, except when the HTTP endpoint is secured using Basic Authentication. In this case the response is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.io.NotSerializableException: com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerResponse (org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationException). Message payload is of type: MuleResponseWriter$1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and no message is placed on the queue. Removing Basic Authentication results in no exception being thrown. Also, removing the JMS outbound endpoint results in the String being echoed back which leads me to believe the problem is with the JMS endpoint. I suspect that the problem is with the response from the JMS endpoint because setting component in the flow to one-way negates the problem. I think the issue might be that the endpoint is sending some response to the HTTP endpoint without authentication credentials and it fails because of it, but I'm unsure how to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the flow that I created:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mule\n    xmlns:scripting=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting\"\n    xmlns:context=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/context\" xmlns=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core\"\n    xmlns:http=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http\" xmlns:jms=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms\"\n    xmlns:jersey=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey\"\n    xmlns:doc=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation\"\n    xmlns:spring=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\" xmlns:core=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core\"\n    version=\"CE-3.3.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n    xmlns:mule-ss=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security\"\n    xmlns:json=\"http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json\"\n    xmlns:ss=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/security\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jms/current/mule-jms.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/jersey/current/mule-jersey.xsd \n    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting/current/mule-scripting.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/spring-security/3.1/mule-spring-security.xsd \n    http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/json/current/mule-json.xsd \n    http://www.springframework.org/schema/security http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.0.xsd \"&gt;\n&lt;jms:activemq-connector name=\"Active_MQ\" specification=\"1.1\" brokerURL=\"tcp://localhost:61616\"\n                        validateConnections=\"true\" doc:name=\"Active MQ\"/&gt;\n&lt;mule-ss:security-manager&gt;\n    &lt;mule-ss:delegate-security-provider name=\"memory-provider\" delegate-ref=\"authenticationManager\"/&gt;\n&lt;/mule-ss:security-manager&gt;\n&lt;spring:beans&gt;\n    &lt;ss:authentication-manager alias=\"authenticationManager\"&gt;\n        &lt;ss:authentication-provider&gt;\n            &lt;ss:user-service id=\"userService\"&gt;\n                &lt;ss:user name=\"username\" password=\"password\" authorities=\"ROLE_ADMIN\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/ss:user-service&gt;\n        &lt;/ss:authentication-provider&gt;\n    &lt;/ss:authentication-manager&gt;\n&lt;/spring:beans&gt;\n&lt;flow name=\"RESTAPISync\" doc:name=\"RESTAPISync\"&gt;\n    &lt;http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=\"request-response\" host=\"localhost\" port=\"8081\" doc:name=\"HTTP\"&gt;\n        &lt;mule-ss:http-security-filter realm=\"realm\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/http:inbound-endpoint&gt;\n    &lt;jersey:resources doc:name=\"REST\"&gt;\n        &lt;component class=\"SFREST\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/jersey:resources&gt;\n    &lt;jms:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=\"request-response\" queue=\"tmp\" connector-ref=\"Active_MQ\"\n                           doc:name=\"JMS\"/&gt;\n&lt;/flow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The SFREST.java component:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import javax.ws.rs.GET;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\n\n\n@Path(\"/pops\")\npublic class SFREST{\n\n    @GET\n    public String getPOPs()  throws Exception{\n        return \"hello\";\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR 2012-11-04 21:40:57,485 [[jmstest].connector.http.mule.default.receiver.02] org.mule.exception.DefaultMessagingExceptionStrategy:\n********************************************************************************\nMessage               : Authentication Attempt Failed.

I wish to implement this in such a way that it will work in the presence of real world HTTP proxies. I am attempting to do this without using a servlet container, to avoid unnecessary overhead in terms of library dependencies, and because the servlet API does not fit the usage patterns of a full duplex http tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of some restrictions that HTTP proxies impose that \"break\" some potential uses of the HTTP protocol:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTTP Pipelining may not be honoured beyond the connection between the client and the proxy. i.e. The proxy may send a single request and wait for the response before sending the next request, even if the client has dispatched multiple pipelined requests to the proxy.</li>\n<li>Chunked encoding may not be honoured beyond the connection between the proxy in a similar fashion: the server may send a response back in chunks, but the proxy may wait for the end chunk before dispatching the full, dechunked response to the client.</li>\n<li>HTTP CONNECT is often only allowed for SSL/TLS ports, typically only port 443, so this cannot be used as a sneaky way to get an unfettered TCP connection to the outside world.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However there is one additional possibility that I am not sure about: do real world HTTP proxies also share a persistent connection to a server between multiple clients? For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Client A sends requests A1, A2, and A3 to server X</li>\n<li>Client B sends requests B1 and B2 to server X</li>\n<li>Client C sends requests C1, C2 and C3 to server X</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would the proxy then potentially open a single connection to server X and send messages in the order:</p>\n\n<p>A1, A2, B1, C1, B2, A3, C2, C3</p>\n\n<p>or a similar order that preserves the ordering from each individual client, but potentially interleaved? Or even worse, could the proxy open multiple connections to the server and scatter messages from each client between the connections, i.e.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Connection 1: A1, C1, C2, C3\nConnection 2: B1, B2, A2, A3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If so, my approach requires more thought as I potentially need to demultiplex these messages into different queues for each tunnel, and cannot simply rely on identifying a connection as being used for a particular client.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of any good resources that describe the quirks of commonly used HTTP proxies and stateful inspecting firewalls?</p>\n"},{"tags":["django","http","redirect","amazon-s3","http-headers"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":3,"question_id":13159748,"title":"Do not propagate headers on HTTP redirects","body":"<p>I have files hosted on Amazon S3, and I'd like to download them after a treatment in my app. This app view requires the HTTP Authorization header to proceed.

I am not permitted to store my content on the <code>SD card</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My input data is essentially of an infinite length.  I tell <code>MediaPlayer</code> that its data source should basically be something like <code>\"http://localhost/myfile.mp3\"</code>.  I've a simple server set up that waits for <code>MediaPlayer</code> to make this request.  However, <code>MediaPlayer</code> isn't very cooperative.  At first, it makes an <code>HTTP GET</code> and tries to grab the whole file.  It times out if we try and simply dump data into the <code>socket</code> so we tried using the <code>HTTP</code> Range header to write data in chunks.  <code>MediaPlayer</code> doesn't like this and doesn't keep requesting the subsequent chunks.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had any success streaming data directly into <code>MediaPlayer</code>?  Do I need to implement an <code>RTSP</code> or <code>Shoutcast</code> server instead?  Am I simply missing a critical <code>HTTP header</code>?  What strategy should I use here?</p>\n\n<p>Rob Szumlakowski</p>\n\n<p>-- Later, I managed to solve the problem:</p>\n\n<p>The <code>HTTP</code> Server was indeed hosted on the phone itself.  It was very simple: just a <code>thread</code> listening on a socket for an <code>HTTP GET</code> request.  When it got the <code>HTTP</code> request, it would one a <code>new socket</code>, write back some <code>HTTP</code> headers and start dumping the <code>MP3</code> audio data back to the <code>socket</code>.  This <code>HTTP</code> server didn't do anything else.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Android Media Player</code> was playing the music as I was streaming to it.  The <code>Media Player</code> behaved very poorly if its playback <code>buffer</code> was emptied while it was playing audio.  It was very important for me to make sure my <code>HTTP</code> server kept writing data into that <code>socket</code>.\nI moved bytes into the socket in small chunks (10 kB). The headers on my <code>HTTP</code> response ended up looking like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Build response headers\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nsb.append( \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n\");\nsb.append( \"Content-Type: audio/mpeg\\r\\n\");\nsb.append( \"Connection: close\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Accept-Ranges: bytes\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Content-Length: \" + totalFileSize + \"\\r\\n\" );\nsb.append( \"Content-Disposition: inline; filename=xxxxx.mp3\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As long as I kept the pipe stoked, the <code>Android Media Player</code> kept consuming it without complaint.  Playing audio only required one request and response.  It ended up working pretty well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","http"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":2,"question_id":13134019,"title":"http post method passing null values to the server","body":"<pre><code>         try \n         {\n\n            url= new URL(ConstantsClass.VENDOR_FOLLOW + \"?UID=\" +android_id+\"&amp;URL='\"+resultfinal+\"'&amp;device=android\");\n\n\n                connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n                connection.setDoOutput(true);\n                connection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\n\n                request = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream());\n                request.flush();\n                request.close();\n                request.write(\"Hello!!!\");\n\n                String line = \"\";\n                InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream());\n                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(isr);\n\n                StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n                while((line=reader.readLine())!=null) {\n                    sb.append(line + \"&amp;\");\n                }\n\n                response = sb.toString();\n                //response.getEntity().getContent();\n\n                Log.i(\"Test\", \"updated response: \" + response);\n\n\n\n            }\n         catch (IOException e) {\n              e.printStackTrace();\n          }\n\n            Log.i(\"Test\", \"**************url list********************\" + url);\n         tag_text.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n                public void onClick(View v) {\n                    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n                    Intent in=new Intent(context,LinkWebView.class);\n                    in.putExtra(\"vendorUrl\", resultfinal);\n                    context.startActivity(in);      \n                    //postData();\n                }\n            });\n             }\n\n    tag_text.setTextSize(16);\n    return view;\n\n}   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hi i am new to android and I am trying to pass values from the url to the server but i am getting null values passed on the server side.

I can use setChunkedStreamingMode(0) and that works fine, but I was thinking it would be nice to avoid the overhead of copying the data.

I\nhave also tried with InputStream using getInputStream() with the same\nresults.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is tested on apache-tomcat-6.0.18.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","http","post","timeout"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6091,"score":6,"question_id":4896949,"title":"Android httpclient file upload data corruption and timeout issues","body":"<p>i'm having issues with uploading images in android.</p>\n\n<p>i'm using apache httpmime 4.1 lib\nthe code is like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MultipartEntity reqEntity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE);\n\nreqEntity.addPart(\"image\", new FileBody(new File(AndorraApplication.getPhotosPath() + \"/\" + entity.getFileName()), \"image/jpeg\"));\nresp = NetworkUtils.sendHttpRequestMultipart(EXPORT_PHOTOS_URI, reqEntity);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NetworkUtils class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class NetworkUtils {\n    public static final int REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT = 3 * 1000; \n    public static final int WAIT_TIMEOUT = 5 * 1000;\n\n    public static HttpResponse sendHttpRequestMultipart(String uri, MultipartEntity entity) {\n        HttpClient mHttpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();\n        final HttpParams params = mHttpClient.getParams();\n        HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(params, REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT);\n        HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(params, WAIT_TIMEOUT);\n        ConnManagerParams.setTimeout(params, WAIT_TIMEOUT);\n\n        HttpPost post = new HttpPost(uri);\n        post.addHeader(entity.getContentType());\n        post.setEntity(entity);\n        HttpResponse resp = mHttpClient.execute(post);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>sometimes everything works fine, but sometimes (especially on a slow connection) the image is uploaded very corrupted. the example is here: <a href=\"http://pixelbirthcloud.com/574_orig.jpg\">http://pixelbirthcloud.com/574_orig.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>it doesn't throw any exceptions. the lenght of the uploaded file is same as the original one.. tried to change mime type to application/octet-stream or remove it at all. tries playing with timeouts. still same result. end users upload corrupted images almost all the time (although i managed to get bronem images just 2 times only).. the image size was 2.5 megs at first, but then i reduced it to 500-700 kb. didn't fix the problem though. </p>\n\n<p>haven't tried to change the apache's library.. maybe it is the problem.. but as far as i read the net, nobody was experiencing this with httpmime library.</p>\n\n<p>what can it be?

However, the interesting this is that, on one testing server (EC2), it improves a lot and no more slow down.  HOwever, the other server (rackspace) only improves a bit.  It still shows slow down.  I even set \"Connection: close\" in the request header, it only improves 100ms. </p>\n\n<p>if http.request is using connection pooling, how to increase it?</p>\n\n<p>in both server, if I do \"ulimit -a\", the # of file open is 1024. </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** <strong>MORE AND MORE</strong> ** -------------------</p>\n\n<p>It seems that even I set maxSockets to higher number, it only works at some limit.  There seems to be a internal or OS dependent socket limitation.  However to bump it up? </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING ** ---------------</p>\n\n<p>After reading lots of post, I find out:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>quoted from: <a href=\"https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1) If I set the headers with connection = 'keep-alive', the performance is good and can go up to maxSocket = 1024 (which is my linux setting).  </p>\n\n<pre><code>var options1 = {\n                  host: 'www.google.com',\n                  port: 80,\n                  path: '/',\n                  method: 'GET',\n    **headers: {\n            'Connection':'keep-alive'\n    }**\n                };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I set it to \"Connection\":\"close\", the response time would be 100 times slower. </p>\n\n<p>Funny things happened here:</p>\n\n<p>1) in EC2, when I first test with Connection:keep-alive, it will take about 20-30 ms.  Then if I change to Connection:Close  OR set Agent:false, the response time will slow down to 300 ms. WIHTOUT restarting the server, if I change to Connection:keep-alive again, the response time will slow down even further to 4000ms.   Either I have to restart server or wait for a while to get back my 20-30ms lighting speed response.</p>\n\n<p>2) If I run it with agent:false, at first, the response time will slow down to 300ms.  But then, it will get faster again and back to \"normal\".   </p>\n\n<p>My guess is connection pooling still in effect even you set agent:false.

I'd like for it to work the same both ways, i.e. when copying files into the mapped drive, they shouldn't be copied into the Virtual Directory in <code>IIS</code>.

This has caused some issues with some of my company's SSRS 2008 reports.  While it is easy to simply use a higher value in order to get the reports to work I would like to know a bit more about how this works.  I understand this particular setting is HTTP thing, not strictly an SSRS thing, but this SSRS is the context of my investigation.  My aim is to derive some sort of way to calculate what the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys should be to cater for my reports, obviously looking at the worst case report which will have the greatest number of possible parameter values.</p>\n\n<p>So my main question is this - with respect to an SSRS report, what constitutes an item that is counted and compared to the setting MaxHTTPCollectionKeys?  Obviously there is some correlation to the total number of values from all parameters for a report, but how does this work exactly?</p>\n\n<p>I have made some test reports (using VS2008) and run them on my local 2008 R2 report server and found that the value of MaxHTTPCollectionKeys does not match exactly with the total number of parameter values passed at run-time.  One of my test reports contained only one multi-valued parameter of type INTEGER for which I defined a list of allowable values - ints 1 - 10.  I set the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 35 (in the report manager web config file.  Note - i reset the report server before performing my tests) and found that the report would run when i select six values (1 - 6, 2 - 7 - any combination of six) but not 7.  This suggests that 29 items are included in the collection before grabbing parameter values.  Further, I set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 30 and found that I could only select a single value for the parameter for the report to run.  When i set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 29 I could not run the report at all (multi-value parameters cannot be null).</p>\n\n<p>I then changed the report and found that by adding a second parameter (basically a copy of the first, multi-value int type with a list of ten ints) the base number rose from 29 to 30.  That is, when i set MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 35 i could only select a total of five values between my two parameters (various combinations of the amount of items for each parameter didn't affect anything).</p>\n\n<p>I made a 3rd test report with no parameters at all (all the report contained was textbox which displayed the current time) and found that when MaxHTTPCollectionKeys = 27 the report worked when it was 26 it did not work.</p>\n\n<p>To reiterate, my aim is to derive some sort of way to calculate what the value for MaxHTTPCollectionKeys should be to cater for my reports, obviously looking at the worst case report which will have the greatest number of possible parameter values.  Can anybody offer some guidelines to calculate this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","visual-studio-2010","http","rest"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":13000835,"title":"I/P issue testing HTTP service on local computer","body":"<p>My development computer is assigned a local I/P of 192.168.2.7 on my LAN.</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://localhost</code> into a browser I get my computer's IIS screen as expected (running Win7).</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://192.168.2.7</code> into a browser I get my computer's IIS screen as expected.</p>\n\n<p>I have an HTTP service listening on port 50421.(Visual Studio)</p>\n\n<p>If I enter <code>http://localhost:50421</code> into a browser I get the proper response from my HTTP service</p>\n\n<p>if I enter <code>http://192.168.2.7:50421</code> into a browser both firefox and I.E. say they cannot connect.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this?

The idea is that Brazilians who are looking for flights from, say, SAO to REC by e.g. Google should have a higher chance of finding that particular flight search engine.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is probably replacing the fragment identifier (#) by a query string (?). The server then dynamically generates nice text content that can be viewed without JavaScript (search results would still be loaded via XHR). In my opinion, that makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to make the URLs more search engine friendly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(A) My customer proposes adding additional keywords into the URL, something like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com?flights+to+Porto+Alegre&amp;S%C3%A3o+Paulo+-+Todos+os+aeroportos+(SAO),+Brasil&amp;ao=Recife+-+Guararapes+Intl+(REC),+Brasil\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com?flights+to+Porto+Alegre&amp;S%C3%A3o+Paulo+-+Todos+os+aeroportos+(SAO),+Brasil&amp;ao=Recife+-+Guararapes+Intl+(REC),+Brasil</a></p></li>\n<li><p>(B) I propose adding a slug instead, which can easily be internationalized, and which is good to read also for humans. Example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com/pt_BR?ad=REC&amp;ao=SAO/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_para_Recife\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/pt_BR?ad=REC&amp;ao=SAO/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_para_Recife</a></p></li>\n<li><p>(C) Or, perhaps without a slug (but - due to parsability - only for a limited parameter set, which has the disadvantage of limiting sharing of URLs by users):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://example.com/pt_BR/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_(SAO)_para_Recife_(REC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/pt_BR/voos_de_Sao_Paulo_(SAO)_para_Recife_(REC</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What do you suggest? Any examples of good URLs for similar use cases?</p>\n\n<p>That all being said: I understand that links from highly ranked pages are still the most important ranking measure. In the end, I wonder if all that complexity really is worth the effort. When I look at Google's own search pages, then they are rather simple. For example, there is no summary of the search query in a H1 tag, just as my customer wants. Of course, Google doesn't search itself...</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","download","delay"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":2,"question_id":12972807,"title":"Why use download queues?","body":"<p>I have seen a lot of websites using download queues.

Its part of a web application, but events have to be seen as soon as they occur. Long polling was not an option because it would be expensive for the webserver to hold on to connections, when no events are available. So i had to go for <code>Short-lived Polls</code>. <br><br>Each client hits the web server every say. 2 seconds (this is a fairly high rate). When events are available, they are sent as <code>JSON</code> to the JavaScript Client. Now, this requires a server set-up to handle high shot-lived connections. I have implemented one such system using <code>Yaws Web server</code>. However, because yaws starts quite a number of many other services, it feels heavy and connections begin to get either refused or aborted when they go beyond 30,000 (maybe because i am running some ETS Tables in the same Erlang VM as yaws is running on [ separating these may require <code>rpc:call/4</code>, which -- i fear -- will increase latency]). I know that there are Operating system specific tweaks to do, and those have been done.<br><br> This would not be a problem if it was easy to cluster up several yaws instances. In yaws, i am using a few appmods, and i am doing things <code>REST</code>-fully. I was thinking that <code>Cowboy Web server</code> might enhance things a bit here. I have not used Cowboy before, but i have used <code>Misultin</code>. Looking at Cowboy, it is a full fledged OTP Application and it seems to be easy to cluster, and being light weight, may perhaps increase on the number of clients the overall system can handle. Storage is on <code>Mnesia</code>, which i can distribute easilly to add more nodes (may be by replication), so that there is a <code>Cowboy</code> instance infront of every <code>Mnesia</code> instance.<br><br><b>Question 1: </b> Is my speculation correct, that if i switched from <code>Yaws</code> to <code>Cowboy</code>, i might increase the performance significantly ?<br><br><b>Question 2: </b> Yaws has a clean API via <code>Appmods</code> and the <code>#arg{}</code> record. Does <code>Cowboy</code> have an equivalent of these two things (illustrate please) ? <br><br><b> EDIT/ADDITIONS </b><hr> <b>Question 3: </b> Can <code>Cowboy</code> handle file uploads ? if so, which server (<code>Yaws</code> vs <code>Cowboy</code>), in your opinion would be better to use in-case of frequent file uploads ? illustrate how file uploads are done with <code>Cowboy</code>.<br><br> It is possible to run several yaws instances on the same machine, do you think that if i create many yaws instances per server (physical box), and have the client-load distributed across these, would help ? what do i need to know about doing this ? <br><br> When i set the <code>yaws.conf</code> parameter  <code>max_connections = nolimit</code>, how would i specify the same in Cowboy ?\n<br><br><b>Yet Another Edit</b><hr>\nNow, i followed the <a href=\"http://pdincau.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/an-interview-with-erlang-cowboy-loic-hoguin-lhoguin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interview with <code>Cowboy Author</code></a> and he discusses the reasons why Cowboy is more light weight than yaws. He says that, <code>\"The biggest difference is the use of binaries instead of lists. The generic acceptor pool is another. I could list a lot of other small differences but I figure these aren’t the most interesting.\"</code>. That because Cowboy uses the listener-pool library <a href=\"https://github.com/extend/ranch\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>Ranch</code></a>, it somehow ends up with a higher capability of handling more connections, plus the use of <code>Binaries</code> and not <code>Lists</code>.<br><br>Another quote from the same interview: <code>\"Since we use one process per connection instead of two, and we use binaries instead of lists, we end up using a lot less memory than other projects without user intervention. Cowboy is also lazy, it doesn’t do anything unless required. So we don’t have much in memory until the user starts calling functions.\"</code>. I wonder how yaws handles this case. Somehow, my problem domain needs light weight http handling. Its actually true that yaws will lead to more memory consumption as compared to say, <code>Mochiweb</code>, <code>Misultin</code> or <code>Cowboy</code>. My greatest concern is that, <code>Yaws</code> has the best/Cleanest <code>API</code> whereby it gives us access to the <code>#arg{}</code>, containing everything we need as an Erlang record, so that we can get them out ourselves, than the other which have numerous functions for extracting stuff outside. Even <code>Documentation</code>: Yaws docs are pretty good and straight forward. Perhaps, i need to look at more <code>CowBoy</code> Code for things like <code>File Upload</code>, simple <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> request handling. <br><br>Otherwise, the questions i asked earlier, remain as pressing concerns. Yaws, is pretty good, but seems an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overkill_%28term%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>OverKill</code></a> for this fast light-weight short-lived high rate poll situation, what do you think ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","get","nsarray"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":11527231,"title":"How to pass NSArray which is part of NSDictionary in http get method?","body":"<p>I want to pass an array to my server.

RFC 2616 has this to say on idempotence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Methods can also have the property of \"idempotence\" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. (RFC 2616 section 9.1.2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not clear on \"the side effects are the same\" qualifier. Does that mean it can be a repeat of the same side effect, or a net-0 effect?</p>\n\n<p>And then...  we've been allowing forward revisions, that is, creating a new version that is not yet the default version, but will be. How does that play into idempotence and PUT? If a new revision is created, then repeating the PUT is not a no-op. Rather, it would create yet another revision. The spec says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example, an article might have a URI for identifying \"the current version\" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in several other URIs being defined by the origin server</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Put another way:</p>\n\n<p><code>PUT /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p>\n\n<p>Results in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>GET /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p></li>\n<li><p><code>GET /node/5/revision/8 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And that's totally fine, by my read of the spec. However, what of:</p>\n\n<p><code>PUT /node/5 {title: \"Bonjour le monde\"}</code></p>\n\n<p>Results in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>GET /node/5 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></li>\n<li><code>GET /node/5/revision/8 {title: \"Hello world\"}</code></li>\n<li><code>GET /node/5/revision/9 {title: \"Bonjour le monde\"}</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is that still spec-valid behavior? And if not, does that mean that any system that uses a Create-Read-Archive-Purge (CRAP) model instead of CRUD, or that supports forward revisioning, is inherently not-PUT-compatible? </p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","svn","http","svn-hooks"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":265,"score":0,"question_id":3027117,"title":"post commit hook fail","body":"<p>I have Master/Slave setup using Win2k8R with SVN 1.6.9 and using TortoiseSVN 1.6.7. \nThe access is through Apache and using http.\nEverything works but when I commit I get the following message:\nError: post-commit hook failed (exit code 1) with output:<br>\nError: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. \nThis happen when using multiple TortoiseSVN dialog for committing the files in rapid succession.

Is there a better way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gareth's answer is pretty good, but I would still like an answer from someone familiar with Rails 2 (because of its unique CookieSessionStore).</p>"},{"tags":["ruby","http","tcp","apachebench"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":12947510,"title":"Why ApacheBench considers HTTP response failed (two times)?","body":"<p>I've taken a basic Ruby http server from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/7044459/513342\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It does seem to produce valid HTTP response:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 14 Dec 2010 10:48:45 GMT\nServer: Ruby\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Length: 17\n\n&lt;html&gt;amit&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm doing a simple ApacheBench test against it:</p>\n\n<p><code>ab -r -n 10 -c 1 http://localhost:2000/</code></p>\n\n<p>It produces weird results:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Complete requests:      10</p>\n  \n  <p>Failed requests:        20</p>\n  \n  <p>(Connect: 0, Receive: 10, Length: 0, Exceptions: 10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can't figure out why.</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","caching","http-headers"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12946812,"title":"How I can use the HTTP headers to indicate in the Response that possibility?","body":"<p>Finally I accomplished to cache dynamic images, css, and javascript files using HTTP headers BUT I have a problem now:</p>\n\n<p>I have specific dynamic images that are equal but has different URL's.</p>\n\n<p>For example: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://example.com/image/src/the-same-image.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/image/src/the-same-image.jpg</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://example.com/image/custom/src/the-same-image2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/image/custom/src/the-same-image2.jpg</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>1 and 2 has the same file content but different URL.

I can submit a form pointing to <a href=\"http://other-site.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://other-site.com/</a>, but then the body won't be raw JSON - it'll be form data.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to ask the other department to change their API, but I want to make sure of this before I do.</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","parsing","email","rest","authentication"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":2,"question_id":12843313,"title":"Parsing a HTTP Basic authentication with an email containing a colon character ( ':' )","body":"<p>I'm using the Authorization header with the Basic type for authentication. \nI'm following the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTP Basic authentication specifications</a> which states that the credentials should follow this form -> userIdentifier:password encoded in base64</p>\n\n<p>We are using an email as the user identifier and according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address\" rel=\"nofollow\">email format specification</a>, the colon(':') character is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>The colon(':') is also a valid character in the password. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing this, I'm looking for a creative way to parse the credentials part of the header that uses a colon(':') as the separator between userID and password. </p>\n\n<p>In this case it's simple -> francis@gmail.com:myPassword</p>\n\n<p>This is where it gets complicated -> francis@gmail.com:80:myPasswordWith:Inside</p>\n\n<p>francis@gmail.com:80 is a valid email according to the email format specification even though this is not used very often.

This gets complicated.</p>\n\n<p>If the data is valid and the user is expecting html, you want to issue a redirect so that refreshing doesn't cause them to re-post.

If they are not expecting html, you can simply return 200 OK.</p>\n\n<p>If the data is invalid and the user is expecting html, you want to re-render the page they came from, with a visible error, so that they can re-post.  To do this, you'd have to run the previous action, and make it aware of the error message.  To decide which was the previous action, perhaps you included that as a hidden parameter in the form.  If they are not expecting html, you can return an applicable 4xx client error. </p>\n\n<p>I find myself doing this silly dance far too many times.

Stuff the error data in the session for a split second between requests, and then clear it, just like the success message.  That way, valid and invalid posts can be handled the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Idea 2: Don't do any normal HTTP posts.  Only use ajax.  Now you don't have to worry about rendering or redirecting at all.

I have used a >2G mp4 video file for my tests and was capturing packets with Wireshark.

No new HTTP request is sent (unless the video is fast forwarded to a certain position). Streaming code chunk for this is quite simple, it reads <code>RandomAccessFile input</code> and writes to <code>OutputStream output</code> via <code>byte[] buffer</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ((read = input.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n    output.write(buffer, 0, read);\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>iPad 1\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP GET request for file comes, asking for byte range <code>[0; &lt;almost the end of the file&gt;]</code></li>\n<li>server responds, starts to stream the file</li>\n<li>iPad gets a chunk or two and then unilaterally decides to stop accepting bytes from the server and issues a <strong>separate <code>GET</code> request</strong> for the next chunk of the file. New range boundaries are e.g. <code>[100, almost the end of the file]</code>. The video is shown OK.</li>\n<li>cycle repeats again from step 2. Left boundary always moves towards the end of the file.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn't investigate how exactly the connection is terminated. It could be that iPad stops sending TCP ACK packets, I suppose this doesn't really matter that much.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that for every terminated connection I get <code>java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe</code> exception. This not only pollutes the logs (which is a minor/solvable problem) but I believe this can hurt performance as raising exceptions is quite expensive. When watching simple video, the exception rate was around 1 exception/sec, but if the server had 100 concurrent users, then the JVM would probably be spending loads of time just calculating stack traces instead of doing real work.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tested this on iPhone using iOS 6 and was able to observe the same behaviour as iPad 1.

IMO the latter seems more preferable although to some it might make the client code more complex. The spec supports named events (events that relate to a particular topic), which to me suggests that a Server-Sent Events connection should be used as single channel for all events.</p>\n\n<p>The following code illustrates the first scenario where a multiple Server-Sent Event connections are initiated:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventSource eventSource1 = new EventSource(\"events/topic1\");\neventSource1.addEventListener('topic1', topic1Listener, false);\n\nvar EventSource eventSource2 = new EventSource(\"events/topic2\");\neventSource2.addEventListener('topic2', topic2Listener, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>eventSource1 would receive \"topic1\" events and eventSource2 would receive \"topic2\" events. Whilst this is pretty straight forward it is also pretty inefficient with a hanging GET occurring for each topic you are interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative is something like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventSource eventSource3 = new EventSource(\"/events?id=1234\")\neventSource3.addEventListener('topic3', topic3Listener, false);\neventSource3.addEventListener('topic4', topic4Listener, false);\n\nvar subscription = new XMLHttpRequest();\nsubscription.open(\"PUT\", \"/events/topic3?id=1234\", true);\nsubscription.send();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example a single EventSource would exist and interest in a particular event would be specified by a separate request with the Server-Sent Event connection and the registration being correlated by the id param. topic3Listener would receive \"topic3\" events and topic4Listener would not. Whilst requiring slightly more code the benefit is that only a single connection is made, but events can be still be identified and handled differently.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number examples on the web that show the use of named events, but it seems the event names (or topics) are known in advance so there is no need for a client to register interest with the server (<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/06/a-wall-powered-by-eventsource-and-server-sent-events/\">example</a>). Whilst I am yet to see an example showing multiple EventSource objects, I also haven't seen an example showing a client using a separate request to register interest in a particular topic, as I am doing above. My interpretation of the spec leads me to believe that indicating an interest in a certain topic (or event name) is entirely up to the developer and that it can be done statically with the client knowing the names of the events it is going to receive or dynamically with the client alerting the server that it is interested in receiving particular events.</p>\n\n<p>I would be pretty interested in hearing other people's thoughts on the topic.

(Even though ASP.Net thinks that the content-length is 0)</p>\n\n<p>I use this code for setting it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpRequest r; .... \nif(r.Headers.AllKeys.Contains(\"Content-Length\")){\n    r.Headers[\"Content-Length\"]=length.ToString();\n}else{\n    r.AddHeader(\"Content-Length\",length.ToString());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This runs fine on mod_mono+Apache and on Mono's implementation of <code>xsp</code>, however, on Microsoft's Cassini dev server, this produces a PlatformNotSupportedException with the text <code>This operation requires IIS integrated pipeline mode.</code></p>\n\n<p>Are there any known workarounds for this issue? </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","http","https","connection-pooling","typhoeus"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":12559575,"title":"Typhoeus does not close https connections","body":"<p>I'm using Typhoeus to handle all of the HTTP calls to external APIs on my site, and it's been working beautifully up until recently. My Rails site started to be unresponsive after a while. I noticed that there're a ton of connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state when I do a netstat, and they're generated by the following piece of code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  requests = []\n  hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new\n  urls.each_with_index do |url, index|\n    request = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, :timeout =&gt; 5000)\n    request.on_complete do |response|\n      begin\n        resp = JSON.parse(response.body)\n\n        if resp[\"error\"]\n          p \"no deal found for #{factual_ids[index]}\"\n          { :deals =&gt; nil }\n        else\n          { :deals =&gt; resp[\"merchant\"][\"deals\"] }\n        end\n      rescue Exception =&gt; e\n        p e.message\n        { :deals =&gt; nil }\n      end\n    end\n\n    requests &lt;&lt; request\n    hydra.queue(request)\n  end\n\n  hydra.run\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only thing that I find different than how I am using Typhoeus in my other HTTP calls is that the urls above are all HTTPS urls.

Is there a option I can pass into Typheous to force close the connection once it's finished?</p>\n"},{"tags":["http","servlets","post","multipartform-data","jboss-4.0.x"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12315250,"title":"Method Not Implemented Error Jboss4 - Unsupported for \"multipart/form-data\"","body":"<p>I have been  unable to get a solution from within SO hence posting.</p>\n\n<p>I have a sample JSP page that is posting to a vendor product that implements and image upload facility.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nfunction upload(){\ndocument.forms[0].enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"\ndocument.forms[0].action=\"/upload\"\ndocument.forms[0].submit()\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After posting the form  while monitoring the request I am getting the following response and the servlet is defaulting to processing the input with content type = <code>\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"</code></p>\n\n<p>These are the request headers:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>POST /upload HTTP/1.1\nAccept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/x-ms-application, application/x-ms-xbap, application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument, application/xaml+xml, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, */*\nReferer: http://localhost:9001/ansHealthConsole/htmljsp/common/reattach_file.jsp?JOBNAME=RESCAN_IMAGES&amp;RFCNAME=READ&amp;SEQNUM=100041767&amp;SESSIONID=62767&amp;SECURETXNID=7309450930646918658&amp;\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------7dc3c0d25050c\nUA-CPU: x86\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: localhost:9001\nContent-Length: 71671\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The response headers are as follows:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nX-Powered-By: Servlet 2.4; Tomcat-5.0.28/JBoss-4.0.1 (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_1 date=200412230944)\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 989\nDate: Fri, 07 Sep 2012 06:13:34 GMT\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nConnection: close\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am unable to debug whether the <code>\"multipart/--\"</code> is not supported within the Tomcat of Jboss 4 or I have some other error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","google-app-engine","http","afnetworking"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":12757039,"title":"My app fails to connect to the server some times","body":"<p>I've been helplessly observing this problem for a couple months now, and have decided this is my best shot. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what the cause of the problem is, but I can list some of the things I'm doing.

After the failed request, I try again, and it works fine. It works fine for the whole day. And then another time randomly the issue repeats itself, sometimes spinning for 10 seconds with a fail, or a minute. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, what can possibly be the cause of this? Is it normal to have some failed connections randomly? Is that something on my part?</p>\n\n<p>But the weird thing is, is that while on my iPhone the app is running, and the indicator is spinning, and it's trying to connect, I try connecting on the iOS simulator, and the connection works just fine.

So it sounds like it may be a software issue rather than connection issue, but then again I have no evidence or data what so ever.</p>\n\n<p>I know it's vague, but I'm hoping someone may have had a similar problem.

Initially I kept the token in a HTTP custom response header so that the client can read the value independent of the data returned by the service. This worked well when client and service are in the same domain, but failed in Cross domain scenario. I have CORS enabled my Service and added all kinds of headers like  \"Access-Control-Expose-Headers\", \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" etc. But the cross domain client is not able to read the custom response header I created which is \"SecureToken:\". I saw in couple of posts that web browsers have some issues with reading custom response headers in cross domain scenarios.
