I modified it some since we have columns that also show dates and ended up with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class NaturalComparer : Comparer&lt;string&gt;, IDisposable\n{\n    private Dictionary&lt;string, string[]&gt; table;\n\n    public NaturalComparer()\n    {\n        table = new Dictionary&lt;string, string[]&gt;();\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        table.Clear();\n        table = null;\n    }\n\n    public override int Compare(string x, string y)\n    {\n        if (x == y)\n        {\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n            DateTime xValueD, yValueD;\n            if (DateTime.TryParse(x, out xValueD) &amp;&amp; DateTime.TryParse(y, out yValueD))\n                return xValueD.CompareTo(yValueD);\n\n\n        string[] x1, y1;\n        if (!table.TryGetValue(x, out x1))\n        {\n            x1 = Regex.Split(x.Replace(\" \", \"\"), \"([0-9]+)\");\n            table.Add(x, x1);\n        }\n        if (!table.TryGetValue(y, out y1))\n        {\n            y1 = Regex.Split(y.Replace(\" \", \"\"), \"([0-9]+)\");\n            table.Add(y, y1);\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; x1.Length &amp;&amp; i &lt; y1.Length; i++)\n        {\n            if (x1[i] != y1[i])\n            {\n                return PartCompare(x1[i], y1[i]);\n            }\n        }\n        if (y1.Length &gt; x1.Length)\n        {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        else if (x1.Length &gt; y1.Length)\n        {\n            return -1;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static int PartCompare(string left, string right)\n    {\n        int x, y;\n        if (!int.TryParse(left, out x))\n        {\n            return left.CompareTo(right);\n        }\n\n        if (!int.TryParse(right, out y))\n        {\n            return left.CompareTo(right);\n        }\n\n        return x.CompareTo(y);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now it also needs to process a special type of string data and it is not doing what we need. The strings show information of ranges of data and they look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string[] list = { \"Empty Values\",\"x&lt;0\" , \"1000.0 &lt; x &lt;=1500.0\", \"900.0 &lt; x &lt;= 1000.0\",\"3000.0 &lt; x &lt;= 3500.0\", \"800.0 &lt; x &lt;=900.0\" };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sorted it should look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x &lt; 0\n800.0 &lt; x &lt;= 900.0\n900.0 &lt; x &lt;= 1000.0\n1000.0 &lt; x &lt;= 1500.0\n3000.0 &lt; x &lt;= 3500.0\nEmpty Values\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, it ends up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>800.0 &lt; x &lt;= 900.0\n900.0 &lt; x &lt;= 1000.0\n1000.0 &lt; x &lt;= 1500.0\n3000.0 &lt; x &lt;= 3500.0\nEmpty Values\nx &lt; 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, logically I think it is doing what it is designed to do, because it picks on the letter and sorts based on that. I would like to keep it searching with regular expressions since it is fast. However, I have no idea how to set them up so it searches, and sorts, correctly. Any ideas, help, readings, or code would be appreciated.\nThanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","validation","phone"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":698,"score":1,"question_id":8634139,"title":"Phone validation regex","body":"<p>I'm using this pattern to check the validation of a phone number </p>\n\n<pre><code>^[0-9\\-\\+]{9,15}$\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's works for <code>0771234567</code> and <code>+0771234567</code>,\nbut I want it to works for <code>077-1234567</code> and <code>+077-1234567</code> and +077-1-23-45-67 and +077-123-45-6-7</p>\n\n<p>What should I change in the pattern?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","exception"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":17,"score":0,"question_id":13295940,"title":"Regex for an exception within an exception","body":"<p>This question here helped me how to do an exception: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1826059/regex-with-exception-of-particular-words\">Regex with exception of particular words</a></p>\n\n<p>Basically, <code>rx = /^(?!apple$|orange$|banana$)/</code> would match everything but apple, orange and banana.

In spite of <code>.*</code> matching everything, the regex engine is aware that it passed over an optional group, and since <code>?</code> means it will try to match if it can, it should work backwards to try and match. Replacing <code>?</code> with <code>+</code> does return <code>('A', )</code>. This suggests that <code>?</code> won't try and match if it doesn't have to, but this seems to contrast with much of what I've read on the subject (esp. J.

For example, I can have the tag <code>(NP .*)</code> at least one time (can be multiple times), followed by a punctuation symbol (in this case a <code>./.</code>). If there's another tag between de <code>(NP)</code> and the <code>./.</code> (like the VP in the example below), the Matcher must not find anything. The problem is that even if I use the question mark after the <code>.*</code> it will keep looking for a <code>)</code> that makes the expression match something in the string. Here is my method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void myMethod() {\n    String input = \"(NP first tag) (VP second tag) ./.\";\n    String regex = \"(\\\\(NP .*?\\\\)( )?)+\" + \"\\\\./\\\\.\";\n\n    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"(\" + regex + \")\");\n    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);\n\n    if (matcher.find()) {\n        System.out.println(\"&lt;S \"+matcher.group(0)+\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"sem grupos.\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method will still match the regex, but it shouldn't.

Unfortunately it seems that this is Type 2 grammar territory.

I tried removing non numeric characters and then use regular expressions but the problem is then it also fetches:\n<br><br>\n<strong>john23 peterson12345</strong></p>\n\n<p>can anyone offer a better way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","emacs"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":11,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2055,"score":11,"question_id":1309050,"title":"Emacs query-replace-regexp multiline","body":"<p>How do you do a query-replace-regexp in Emacs that will match across multiple lines? </p>\n\n<p>as a trivial example I'd want <code>&lt;p&gt;\\(.*?\\)&lt;/p&gt;</code> to match</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;foo\nbar\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["regex","qt"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13186326,"title":"QRegExp Extract Two Numbers","body":"<p>All I am trying to extract two numbers from a user string.

I noticed that in Kohana framework's routing system you can set a route using something similar to a regular expression. Then you can create an url matching a route you've set. I'm trying to do something similar, but I can't find a clean way to do it. I've for example got the following regular expression:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/^(?&lt;application&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;controller&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;method&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;parameters&gt;\\w+)\\/?$/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I want to be able to say that \"application\" equals \"a\", \"controller\" equals \"b\", \"method\" equals \"c\" and \"parameters\" equals \"d\". Then I should get a string that replaces the parts with the values specified. I can't find a good way to do this though. I've basically thought of two ways: 1) replace the corresponding values in the regular expression with the specified values, or 2) create a custom \"regex syntax\" that you can easily be used to create string and convert it to a \"proper\" regular expression when needed. Kohana uses the latter, but both ways sound quite bad to me. How would you do this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'll try to clarify it a bit. I for example pass the following string to the regular expression shown above using <code>preg_match()</code>: \"myApplication/myController/myMethod/myParameters\". This returns an array that has a couple of items, including 4 items with indexes \"application\", \"controller\", \"method\" and \"parameters\" with the corresponding values. Now I have to create the string \"myApplication/myController/myMethod/myParameters\" with the regular expression's pattern while I only have that array with the 4 items.

To give a little background on why I'm doing this, it's to create a cookie utility in JavaScript that is a little more intelligent and supports keys ala ASP. </p>\n\n<p>With that being said, I'm finding that the following RegExp <code>/([^&amp;=\\s]+)=(([^&amp;]*)(&amp;[^&amp;=\\s]*)*)(&amp;|$)/g</code> does 99% of what I need it to. I changed the RegExp suggested by the contributors below to also ignore empty spaces. This allowed me to turn the string above into the following collection:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [myTestKey, this is my test data &amp; such],\n    [myOtherKey, this is the other value]]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It even works in some more extreme examples, allowing me to turn a string like:</p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectB = 'thisstuff===myv=alue me==&amp; other things=&amp;thatstuff=my other value too';</code></p>\n\n<p>Into:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [thisstuff, ==myv=alue me==&amp; other things=],\n    [thatstuff, my other value too]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when you take a string like: </p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectC = 'me===regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=&amp;you=nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b';</code></p>\n\n<p>Everything gets out of whack again. I understand why this is happening as a result of the regular expression above (kudos for a very awesome explanation), but I'm (obviously) not comfortable enough with regular expressions to figure out a work around.</p>\n\n<p>As far as importance goes, I need this cookie utility to be able to read and write cookies that can be understood by ASP and ASP.NET &amp; vice versa. From playing with the example above, I'm thinking that we've taken it as far as we can, but if I'm wrong, any additional input would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr - Almost there, but is it possible to account for outliers like <code>subjectC</code>? </p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectC = 'me===regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=&amp;you=nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b';</code></p>\n\n<p>Actual ouput:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [me, ==regexs are hard for &amp;me],\n    [you, ],\n    [you, nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Versus expected output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [me, ==regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=],\n    [you, nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks again for all of your help.

I'm trying to write an email validating regular expression, that follows the following rules:</p>\n\n<p><em>An email address must consist of a local part and a domain part separated by an @ symbol (x40) with a combined length of no more than 256 characters.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Local Part:</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>A non-quoted local part may consist of (a-z), (A-Z), numeric (0-9) and the following characters:</em> !#$%&amp;'*+-/=?^<code>_</code>{`|}~ <em>CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Dots may also be present in the local part, but can not be the first nor last character, nor adjacent to another dot (.) ALMOST CHECK, DOT CAN STILL BE LAST</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Maximum length of the local part is 64 characters. MIGHT IGNORE - NOT CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Domain Part:</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Domain part consists of dot separated labels of 1 to 63 characters each, up to a maximum total length of 255 characters (including dot delimiters). CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Domain labels must begin and end with an alpha (a-z) (A-Z) or numeric (0-9)  character and may include hyphens (-).

I know it is possible to do it by capturing the rest of the expression in a separate group and then running the matcher on that group value and keep doing it until we reach the end of the expression, but I would be more interested to know if the pattern-matcher has an inherent functionality for the same.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","preg-match","expression"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":1,"question_id":13066789,"title":"preg_match on hostname","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a regular expression that matches on hostname in the url.\nI want it to hit on de following hostnames:\n- www.site.nl\n- site.nl</p>\n\n<p>I want it to return site.nl</p>\n\n<p>I got this working with the following regex:\n(?(?&lt;=www.))site.(?:nl|be|eu)</p>\n\n<p>However when I use this regex on something.site.nl it also returns site.nl.

The API documentation says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once created, a matcher can be used to perform three different kinds of match operations:\n  [...]\n  Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure. More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the state of the matcher. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What the  API documentation further says is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to query any part of it before a successful match will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>String s = \"foo=23,bar=42\";\nPattern p = Pattern.compile(\"foo=(?&lt;foo&gt;[0-9]*),bar=(?&lt;bar&gt;[0-9]*)\");\nMatcher matcher = p.matcher(s);\nSystem.out.println(matcher.group(\"foo\")); // (1)\nSystem.out.println(matcher.group(\"bar\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code throws a</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: No match found\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>at <code>(1)</code>. To get around this, it is necessary to call <code>matches()</code> or other methods that bring the <code>Matcher</code> into a state that allows <code>group()</code>. The following works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>String s = \"foo=23,bar=42\";\nPattern p = Pattern.compile(\"foo=(?&lt;foo&gt;[0-9]*),bar=(?&lt;bar&gt;[0-9]*)\");\nMatcher matcher = p.matcher(s);\nmatcher.matches(); // (2)\nSystem.out.println(matcher.group(\"foo\"));\nSystem.out.println(matcher.group(\"bar\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Adding the call to <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#matches%28%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>matches()</code></a> at <code>(2)</code> sets the <code>Matcher</code> into the proper state to call <code>group()</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question, probably not constructive</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Why</em> is this API designed like this?

For PHP, I'm using the Yii framework. Within Node.js, I use express.</p>\n\n<p>PHP is running through Nginx. I use the proxy_pass directive to funnel any request starting with /node to the Node server running on port 3000 (e.g. server.com/node/api is proxyed to server.com:3000/api.)</p>\n\n<p>This works well, for the most part. However, one of the directives in my Nginx configuration file ensures that requests for non-existent static files are not passed on to Yii. Instead, a simple 404 error is returned. The original version of this directive looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>location ~ \\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar|txt)$ {\n    try_files $uri =404;\n    #For production servers you can set expires header with a long period\n    expires 3M;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this directive is that some static files (notably the socket.io client) are served by Node.js. When the browser requests server.com/node/socket.io/socket.io.js, the above rule gets fired, and Nginx returns the 404.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is modify the rule so that the 404 is returned only when the request for a static file is NOT preceded by /node/. I've tried various combinations of rules, but none of them seem to work. After consulting the perl regular expression documentation, here's one that I thought might work, but doesn't:</p>\n\n<pre><code>location ~* (?&lt;!/node/)\\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar|txt)$ {\n    try_files $uri =404;\n    expires 3M;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I thought the negative/look-behind part of the rule, <code>(?&lt;!/node/)</code>, would work to exclude requests starting with /node/, but it doesn't. Instead, the rule gets fired for both genuinely non-existent js files and for socket.io.js (and various other static files served from Node.js.) So in both cases I get a 404.</p>\n\n<p>How should I change the regular expression so that the rule only gets applied when the request does NOT start with /node/?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","arrays","url-routing"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":2,"question_id":12996485,"title":"PHP Routing based on arrays, How to match * to anything","body":"<p>I have an array containing all routes/urls and their path,</p>\n\n<pre><code>Example : $route = array(\n'/' =&gt; 'files/index.php',\n'pages' =&gt; 'files/pages.php',\n'pages/add' =&gt; 'files/page-add.php',\n'posts/*' =&gt; 'files/posts.php',\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using array_key_exists() i check if a route exists in the array and if yes then load its path and it works if a direct match is found.</p>\n\n<p>I want it to match to <code>posts/*</code> path whenever a request is made to <code>posts/anything, posts/view/10</code>, And i cannot do this using array_key_exists().</p>\n\n<p>Do you guys have any ideas/suggestions on which method i should use?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","regex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":47,"score":-4,"question_id":12990305,"title":"please help me to write regular expression","body":"<p>I want to write a regular expression for my Python code.

Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[April]]\n\nApril is the fourth month of the year. It has 30 days. The name April comes from that Latin word aperire which means \"to open\". This probably refers to growing plants in spring. April begins on the same day of week as July in all years and also January in leap years.\n\nApril's flower is the Sweet Pea. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\n\n== April in poetry ==\n\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter. For example: April showers bring May flowers.\n\n== Events in April ==\n\n[[August]]\n\nAugust is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days, the same number of days as the previous month, July, and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.\n\n== The Month ==\n\nThis month was first called Sextilis in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.\n\nAugust is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month.  The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September.\n\nAugust, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other. In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere. In a common year, no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in leap years, February starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as November.\n\nAugust's flower is the Gladiolus with the birthstone being peridot. The astrological signs for August are Leo (July 24 - August 22) and Virgo (August 23 - September 23).\n\n== August observances ==\n\n=== Fixed observances and events ===\n\n=== Moveable and Monthlong events ===\n\n== Selection of Historical Events ==\n\n== References ==\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>April and August are both wiki articles.

I also know that these are all very difficult to show, even for a puzzle lover.  So, I promise 100 bonus points as soon as bounties are available for any complete answer.</p>\n\n<p>-Edit-</p>\n\n<p><strong>First solution I was working on</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay, so the first solution I was working on is to solve 3.  I tried breaking the lines at the semicolons, and I was then hoping to grab the data, line-by-line and edit it further.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$input = file_get_contents('explode.txt');\nforeach(explode(\"\\n\", $input) as $line){\n  $words = explode(';', $line); \n  foreach($words as $word){\n  echo $word;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, looking at the output, the data ended up in the same format it was already in, only subtract the semicolons.  This wasn't very useful, and I decided to stop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second solution I am working on</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is based around this line of code: <code>preg_match_all('/\\;([^;]+)\\}/', $myFile, $matches)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There's now a working solution to part 1 of the question, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8675385/recursive-regex-with-garbled-text-surrounding-getting-arrayarray\">thanks to EPB and fge</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$myFile = file_get_contents('fakexample.txt');\nfunction get_between($startString, $endString, $myFile){\n  //Escape start and end strings.\n  $startStringSafe = preg_quote($startString, '/');\n  $endStringSafe = preg_quote($endString, '/');\n  //non-greedy match any character between start and end strings. \n  //s modifier should make it also match newlines.\n  preg_match_all(\"/$startStringSafe(.*?)$endStringSafe/s\", $myFile, $matches);\n  return $matches;\n}\n$list = get_between(\"(\", \")\", $myFile);\nforeach($list[1] as $list){\n  echo $list.\"\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some issues I had were that I wasn't using RegEx correctly.  I think the <code>ArrayArray</code> return problem was because I didn't encapsulate the preg_match_all function such that it returned $matches to a private function.  I'm still unsure.  I'm also still unsure about whether I should be using the <code>file_get_contents()</code> function to read the file.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The third solution attempt</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, I had an initial idea of how I wanted to approach this, and I decided to go about it my own way.  Again, I started with question 1 because it seemed easiest.  It has the fewest exceptions</p>\n\n<pre><code>function find_between($input,$start,$end) {\n  if (strpos($input,$start) === false || strpos($input,$end) === false) {\n    return false;\n  } else {\n    $start_position = strpos($input,$start)+strlen($start);\n    $end_position = strpos($input,$end);\n    return substr($input,$start_position,$end_position-$start_position);\n  }\n}\n\n$myFile = file_get_contents('explode.txt');\n\n$output = find_between($myFile,'(',')');\n\necho $output;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, this will work.  The issue I'm having is with the recursion.  I tried <code>foreach($output as $output){echo $output;}</code>, but this gave me an error.  It seems obvious to me that it's because I haven't recursed and so haven't arrayized.  The reason I stopped along this path is because I was told by several programmers that I was doomed to failure.  So, I'm currently back to working on solution 2.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","regex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12930007,"title":"How to validate Base64 string using regex in JavaScript?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/475074/regex-to-parse-or-validate-base64-data\">RegEx to parse or validate Base64 data</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>How to validate Base64 string in Javascript using regex?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","arrays","preg-match"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12929429,"title":"How to append output of preg_match to an existing array?","body":"<p>I have two preg_match() calls and i want to merge the arrays instead of replacing the first array. my code so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$arr = Array();\n$string1 = \"Article: graphics card\";\n$string2 = \"Price: 300 Euro\";\n$regex1 = \"/Article[\\:] (?P&lt;article&gt;.*)/\";\n$regex2 = \"/Price[\\:] (?P&lt;price&gt;[0-9]+) Euro/\";\n\npreg_match($regex1, $string1, $arr);\n//output here:\n$arr['article'] = \"graphics card\"\n$arr['price'] = null\npreg_match($regex2, $string2, $arr);\n//output here:\n$arr['article'] = null\n$arr['price'] = \"300\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How may I match so my output will be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$arr['article'] = \"graphics card\"\n$arr['price'] = \"300\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","regex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":6,"question_id":12929750,"title":"Regex in javascript - Match a string like \"ABC12\"","body":"<p>How to match the following string using regular expression in Javascript?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Has a total of 5 characters  </li>\n<li>First 3 charaters are capital letters  </li>\n<li>Last 2 characters are only numbers</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have got this pattern, <code>[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{2}</code>, but seems that it's still missing something.

In this example I'm going to use capital cities and major cities.</p>\n\n<p>I am displaying a list, with a question and answer. I need both to be searchable. So far this seems to be working fine. As a question is typed, for example, \"What is the capital...\" it will start to display relevant questions. When it is completed, \"What is the capital of the United Kingdom?\", it will filter the correct list item and hide the rest.</p>\n\n<p>What I could do with accomplishing is making the search a lot less strict, if that makes sense. So for example, at the moment, if someone searches \"What is the capital of United Kingdom?\" (note that the 'the' is missing), the relevant question and answer will not display. Now, I wondered if regular expressions or stemming might be appropriate. But I don't want it to just ignore words like \"the\". I'd like it to strip it down completely and be more of a wild card search. Being specific in this case is not important.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, if I have a question and answer already stored like, Q: \"What is the capital of Canada?\" A: \"Ottawa, Ontario is the capital of Canada\".
