I'm working in a web-based (Struts 2) project with lots of JSPs, and most of <code>input, select, table</code> and <code>a</code> elements are defined with only with the <code>name</code> attribute, no <code>id</code> set, such as:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;input name=\"myname\" class=\"myclass\" value=\"\" type=\"text\"/&gt;</code> </p>\n\n<p>So far so good, except that unfortunately there's a lot of javascript validation for those fields, and as far as I could read the code before leaving most of them actually refer to the elements with <code>document.getElementById</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The catch here is that this is an old application (not that much old actually) only compatible with IE-6 and IE-7 (I didn't searched the net in order to understand how IE actually seems to find the element only with the <code>name</code> attribute, but I guess it must do something). No surprise every other single browser complains and cries.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm trying to come up with a simple solution: look up all JSPs that defines <code>input, select, table</code> and <code>a</code> elements with the <code>name</code> attribute but not <code>id</code> in order to fix the HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Using my good ol' friend <a href=\"http://rubular.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rubular.com</a> I came up with the following:</p>\n\n<p><code>/&lt;(?:(input|select|a|table))\\s+((?!id).)*&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>This will catch every referred element without <code>id</code>. But how can I actually assert that only those with <code>name</code> are matched?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, another important point.

I thought it worked like this: once the regex hits the <code>z</code> it then matches right to the end of the line using <code>.*</code>. In spite of <code>.*</code> matching everything, the regex engine is aware that it passed over an optional group, and since <code>?</code> means it will try to match if it can, it should work backwards to try and match. Replacing <code>?</code> with <code>+</code> does return <code>('A', )</code>. This suggests that <code>?</code> won't try and match if it doesn't have to, but this seems to contrast with much of what I've read on the subject (esp. J.

Here is my method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void myMethod() {\n    String input = \"(NP first tag) (VP second tag) ./.\";\n    String regex = \"(\\\\(NP .*?\\\\)( )?)+\" + \"\\\\./\\\\.\";\n\n    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"(\" + regex + \")\");\n    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);\n\n    if (matcher.find()) {\n        System.out.println(\"&lt;S \"+matcher.group(0)+\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"sem grupos.\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method will still match the regex, but it shouldn't.  I need it to tell me that no group was found, since the \"VP\" tag shouldn't be there. I believe the problem relies on the greedy strategy adopted by the Regex in Java. It tries to find some combination of characters that attend to the pattern described by the regex. I have no idea on how to rewrite this expression.</p>\n\n<p>Any Help?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDITED:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) I noticed that my question was a bit confusing, so I changed a bit the example to make it clearer.</p>\n\n<p>2) Thanks Aan Moore. I Agree that I was using more groups than necessary, but this happened because of the operators like <code>+</code>. I tried to cut away the unnecessary groups. Also your simple idea of replacing the <code>.*?</code> by a <code>[^)]*?</code> was great! The only thing that I adjusted was that I escaped the <code>)</code> symbol by using <code>[^\\\\)]*?</code>. Below I show the final REGEX used. </p>\n\n<pre><code>String regex = \"(\\\\(NP [^\\\\)]*?\\\\) ?)+\\\\./\\\\.\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot! :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","regex"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13272729,"title":"JavaScript: Regex for two char Country codes","body":"<p>I want to regex for these 3 two-chared country codes: de,fr,es in JavaScript.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/^(de|fr|es)/i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this correct?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","scala"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13252305,"title":"scala: get all possible matches of a regular expression","body":"<p>I need to find all the pairs of word joined with the \"and\" word.</p>\n\n<p>So far I tried with the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>val salute = \"\"\".*?(\\w+\\W+)and(\\W+\\w+).*\"\"\".r\n\nval salute(a,b) = \"hello ladies and gentlemen, mesdames and messieurs, how are you?\"\na: String = \"ladies \"\nb: String = \" gentlemen\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I'd like something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>salute.findAllMatches(\"hello ladies and gentlemen, mesdames and messieurs, how are you?\")\nList[(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)] = List((ladies,gentlemen), (mesdames,mesieurs))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried with</p>\n\n<pre><code>salute.findAllIn(\"hello ladies and gentlemen, mesdames and messieurs, how are you?\").toList\nres14: List[String] = List(hello ladies and gentlemen, mesdames and messieurs, how are you?)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, as you can see, without success...</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":0,"question_id":13252533,"title":"What regular expression in PHP can handle backslash of internal double quotes?","body":"<p>I have data that looks literally like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"manager1\": \"Richard \"Dick\" Smith, MD, MBA\",\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it needs to look literally like this for it to work with JSON:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"manager1\": \"Richard \\\"Dick\\\" Smith, MD, MBA\",\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: The difference are backslashes only for the internal double-quotes of the nickname of Dick, while leaving the rest of the string without changes.</p>\n\n<p>I'm having trouble dealing with the credentials (MD, MBA) separated by commas.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(1) &lt;img id=\"icon-loader-small\" src=\"/css/images/loader-small.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle; display:none;\"/&gt;\n(2) &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"name\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;loggedInAs()?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;a href=\"/Login/logout\"&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n(3) &lt;?php echo ($watched_dir-&gt;getExistsFlag())?\"\":\"&lt;span class='ui-icon-alert'&gt;&lt;img src='/css/images/warning-icon.png'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\"?&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo $watched_dir-&gt;getDirectory();?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"ui-icon ui-icon-close\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n(EDIT: 4) &lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"/Preference/stream-setting\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" onsubmit=\"return confirm('&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;confirm_pypo_restart_text ?&gt;');\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In (1) there a <code>src=\"/css</code>, and as it is not in PHP tags I want that to become <code>src=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/css</code>. In (2), there is a PHP tag but it is not around the <code>href=\"/Login</code>, so it also becomes <code>href=\"&lt;?php echo $baseUrl?&gt;/Login</code>.\nUnfortunately, (3) has <code>src='/css</code> but <em>inside</em> the PHP tags (it is an echoed string). It is also quoted by <code>\"</code> in the PHP code, so the modification needs to pick up on that too. The final result would look something like: <code>src='\".$baseUrl.\"/css</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All the other modifications to my HTML and PHP files have been done using a regex (I know, I know...). If regexes could support matching everything except a certain pattern, like <code>[^(&lt;\\?php)(\\?&gt;)]*</code> then I would be flying through this part. Unfortunately it seems that this is Type 2 grammar territory. So - what should I use?\nIdeally it needs to be installed by default with the GNU suite, but other tools like PHP itself or other interpreters are fine too, just not preferred. Of course, if someone could structure a regex that would work on the above examples, then that would be excellent.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: (4) is the nasty match, where most regexes will fail.</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","node.js","express"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":1,"question_id":13202907,"title":"Apply regular expression for expressjs","body":"<p>I need to handle requests like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/key/6435.254.53538\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wrote regexp that work in RegexPal</p>\n\n<pre><code>(([0-9]+\\.?)+)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I create handler in Express.js</p>\n\n<pre><code>/key/:key(([0-9]+\\.?)+)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it returns only last part of the key</p>\n\n<pre><code>req.params.key == '53538'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how can I retrieve full key?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","regex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":2,"question_id":13202096,"title":"Splitting out METARs/TAFs","body":"<p>I get the following input that I want to split into four parts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-\nKPDX 021453Z 16004KT 10SM FEW007 SCT060 BKN200 11/09 A3002 RMK\n     AO2 SLP166 T01060094 55008\nTAF AMD KPDX 021453Z 0215/0312 10005KT P6SM FEW006 SCT060 BKN150\n     FM021800 11005KT P6SM SCT050 OVC100\n     FM022200 11007KT P6SM -RA OVC050\n     FM030500 12005KT P6SM -RA OVC035\nKSEA 021453Z 15003KT 10SM FEW035 BKN180 11/09 A3001 RMK AO2\n     SLP168 60000 T01110089 58010\nTAF AMD KSEA 021501Z 0215/0318 14004KT P6SM SCT020 BKN150\n     FM021800 16005KT P6SM SCT025 OVC090\n     FM030100 19005KT P6SM OVC070\n     FM030200 15005KT P6SM -RA OVC045\n     FM030600 16007KT P6SM -RA BKN025 OVC045\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's a METAR, then a TAF, then a METAR, then a TAF.</p>\n\n<p>Input rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The airport codes can change, but should always be 3 or 4 letters.</li>\n<li>METARS will start with either the airport code, or \"SPECI\" followed by the airport code (SPECI KPDX).</li>\n<li>TAFs will start with either the aiport code, or \"TAF AMD\" followed by the airport code (TAF AMD KPDX).</li>\n<li>In any report, the airport code will always be followed by the datetime stamp.</li>\n<li>In a TAF, the datetime stamp will always be followed by the valid times (0215/0318 for example).</li>\n<li>There could be as few as 2 reports, or many more than 4.</li>\n<li>Any report could be just a single line.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I want to grab each report by itself, so I'm using the regex <code>^(\\\\w+.*?)(?:^\\\\b|\\\\Z)</code> in the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; reports = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile( \"^(\\\\w+.*?)(?:^\\\\b|\\\\Z)\", Pattern.DOTALL|Pattern.MULTILINE );\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher( input );\nwhile( matcher.find() )\n    reports.add( new String( matcher.group( 1 ).trim() ) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It works great, I get 4 results:</p>\n\n<p>1:</p>\n\n<pre><code>KPDX 021453Z 16004KT 10SM FEW007 SCT060 BKN200 11/09 A3002 RMK\n     AO2 SLP166 T01060094 55008\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TAF AMD KPDX 021453Z 0215/0312 10005KT P6SM FEW006 SCT060 BKN150\n     FM021800 11005KT P6SM SCT050 OVC100\n     FM022200 11007KT P6SM -RA OVC050\n     FM030500 12005KT P6SM -RA OVC035\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3:</p>\n\n<pre><code>KSEA 021453Z 15003KT 10SM FEW035 BKN180 11/09 A3001 RMK AO2\n     SLP168 60000 T01110089 58010\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TAF AMD KSEA 021501Z 0215/0318 14004KT P6SM SCT020 BKN150\n     FM021800 16005KT P6SM SCT025 OVC090\n     FM030100 19005KT P6SM OVC070\n     FM030200 15005KT P6SM -RA OVC045\n     FM030600 16007KT P6SM -RA BKN025 OVC045\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have encountered a case where my regex fails.

I tried removing non numeric characters and then use regular expressions but the problem is then it also fetches:\n<br><br>\n<strong>john23 peterson12345</strong></p>\n\n<p>can anyone offer a better way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","emacs"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":11,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2054,"score":11,"question_id":1309050,"title":"Emacs query-replace-regexp multiline","body":"<p>How do you do a query-replace-regexp in Emacs that will match across multiple lines? </p>\n\n<p>as a trivial example I'd want <code>&lt;p&gt;\\(.*?\\)&lt;/p&gt;</code> to match</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;foo\nbar\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["regex","qt"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13186326,"title":"QRegExp Extract Two Numbers","body":"<p>All I am trying to extract two numbers from a user string.

I noticed that in Kohana framework's routing system you can set a route using something similar to a regular expression. Then you can create an url matching a route you've set. I'm trying to do something similar, but I can't find a clean way to do it. I've for example got the following regular expression:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/^(?&lt;application&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;controller&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;method&gt;\\w+)\\/(?&lt;parameters&gt;\\w+)\\/?$/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I want to be able to say that \"application\" equals \"a\", \"controller\" equals \"b\", \"method\" equals \"c\" and \"parameters\" equals \"d\". Then I should get a string that replaces the parts with the values specified. I can't find a good way to do this though. I've basically thought of two ways: 1) replace the corresponding values in the regular expression with the specified values, or 2) create a custom \"regex syntax\" that you can easily be used to create string and convert it to a \"proper\" regular expression when needed. Kohana uses the latter, but both ways sound quite bad to me. How would you do this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'll try to clarify it a bit. I for example pass the following string to the regular expression shown above using <code>preg_match()</code>: \"myApplication/myController/myMethod/myParameters\". This returns an array that has a couple of items, including 4 items with indexes \"application\", \"controller\", \"method\" and \"parameters\" with the corresponding values. Now I have to create the string \"myApplication/myController/myMethod/myParameters\" with the regular expression's pattern while I only have that array with the 4 items.

To give a little background on why I'm doing this, it's to create a cookie utility in JavaScript that is a little more intelligent and supports keys ala ASP. </p>\n\n<p>With that being said, I'm finding that the following RegExp <code>/([^&amp;=\\s]+)=(([^&amp;]*)(&amp;[^&amp;=\\s]*)*)(&amp;|$)/g</code> does 99% of what I need it to. I changed the RegExp suggested by the contributors below to also ignore empty spaces. This allowed me to turn the string above into the following collection:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [myTestKey, this is my test data &amp; such],\n    [myOtherKey, this is the other value]]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It even works in some more extreme examples, allowing me to turn a string like:</p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectB = 'thisstuff===myv=alue me==&amp; other things=&amp;thatstuff=my other value too';</code></p>\n\n<p>Into:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [thisstuff, ==myv=alue me==&amp; other things=],\n    [thatstuff, my other value too]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when you take a string like: </p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectC = 'me===regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=&amp;you=nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b';</code></p>\n\n<p>Everything gets out of whack again. I understand why this is happening as a result of the regular expression above (kudos for a very awesome explanation), but I'm (obviously) not comfortable enough with regular expressions to figure out a work around.</p>\n\n<p>As far as importance goes, I need this cookie utility to be able to read and write cookies that can be understood by ASP and ASP.NET &amp; vice versa. From playing with the example above, I'm thinking that we've taken it as far as we can, but if I'm wrong, any additional input would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr - Almost there, but is it possible to account for outliers like <code>subjectC</code>? </p>\n\n<p><code>var subjectC = 'me===regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=&amp;you=nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b';</code></p>\n\n<p>Actual ouput:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [me, ==regexs are hard for &amp;me],\n    [you, ],\n    [you, nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Versus expected output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [me, ==regexs are hard for &amp;me&amp;you=],\n    [you, nah, not really you\\'re just a n00b]\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks again for all of your help.

I'm trying to write an email validating regular expression, that follows the following rules:</p>\n\n<p><em>An email address must consist of a local part and a domain part separated by an @ symbol (x40) with a combined length of no more than 256 characters.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Local Part:</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>A non-quoted local part may consist of (a-z), (A-Z), numeric (0-9) and the following characters:</em> !#$%&amp;'*+-/=?^<code>_</code>{`|}~ <em>CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Dots may also be present in the local part, but can not be the first nor last character, nor adjacent to another dot (.) ALMOST CHECK, DOT CAN STILL BE LAST</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Maximum length of the local part is 64 characters. MIGHT IGNORE - NOT CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Domain Part:</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Domain part consists of dot separated labels of 1 to 63 characters each, up to a maximum total length of 255 characters (including dot delimiters). CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Domain labels must begin and end with an alpha (a-z) (A-Z) or numeric (0-9)  character and may include hyphens (-).  In addition, the TLD (last label) must contain at least one alpha character or hyphen (not all numeric), and be at least two characters. - CHECK</em></p>\n\n<p>In caps is how far along I am, in terms of meeting the goal.

I know it is possible to do it by capturing the rest of the expression in a separate group and then running the matcher on that group value and keep doing it until we reach the end of the expression, but I would be more interested to know if the pattern-matcher has an inherent functionality for the same.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","preg-match","expression"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":1,"question_id":13066789,"title":"preg_match on hostname","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a regular expression that matches on hostname in the url.\nI want it to hit on de following hostnames:\n- www.site.nl\n- site.nl</p>\n\n<p>I want it to return site.nl</p>\n\n<p>I got this working with the following regex:\n(?(?&lt;=www.))site.(?:nl|be|eu)</p>\n\n<p>However when I use this regex on something.site.nl it also returns site.nl.
