We are going with the traditional 3 tier system using EF in the data layer, plain jane c# classes in the business layer and MVC / WCF for the ui layer.  We have prototyped enough of the application to realize that this will work for us, however due to the complexity of the business requirements <strong>it will be common for some of the business components interact with one another.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider the following two business components:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RetailManager - Deal with everything related to retail in the system</li>\n<li>CartManager - Deals with everything related to the shopping cart experience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The two interact, for instance, during the checkout process when an item is purchased.  The inventory for the purchased item needs to be reduced.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my thought process so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Let business components reference each other and ensure cyclical references never happen (CartManager references RetailManager, but never the other way).  \"Checkout\" would be a method on the CartManager class, and it would call a method on the RetailManager to adjust inventory.  While this will work, I'm not sure how well it will scale, and what the maintenance cost will be over time.  It doesn't feel 100% \"right\" to me.</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a Facade between the business components and the UI tier.  In this example, the Facade would have the checkout method and a reference to both managers.  I like this approach more than the first, however I know that not all of my business objects will need a Facade, and I don't want to create a ton of Facade classes just to have empty pass through methods.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm leaning towards 2, with the caveat that I will only create facade classes where needed.  The UI tier will have access to both the Facade and the business layer components and will have to know when to use which (the only part I don't like about this solution).</p>\n\n<p>I've done a lot of research but haven't been able to come to come up with a solution that feels completely right.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts on using the facade pattern in this way, or other ideas to solve the problem are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","asp.net-mvc","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":421,"score":1,"question_id":12181428,"title":"ASP.NET MVC 4 EF5 with MySQL","body":"<p>So I've just picked up VS2012 and I want to start an ASP.NET MVC 4 app with EF5.</p>\n\n<p>My host does not have MSSQL so I have to use MySQL.</p>\n\n<p>How do I tell my app that it should use MySQL?

If it doesn't point to a valid link, adding CNN's url prefix to it, and seeing if that is then a valid link. But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since I'd be running each link twice, that'd be a problem where POST operations were required, as it'd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API I'm consuming off a public framework, I wouldn't have control of the source code to safeguard against that.</p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions?\nIs there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do easily?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","asp.net-mvc","linq","entity-framework","sql-server-2008-r2"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":175,"score":1,"question_id":12928463,"title":"Sometimes get Timeout expired exception with Linq to EF and after a restart of server, it works fine","body":"<p>I have hosted my website at rackspace cloud server.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I get the below exception while fetching records from database.

The validation works fine -- fields which are required are successfully monitored. However, when I go to reset my form -- I only see the red background for my inputs clear, not the validation messages.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/resetForm\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery validate documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resets input fields to their original value (requires form plugin),\n  removes classes indicating invalid elements and <strong>hides error messages</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's all the info I think is relevant to the issue. Please let me know if you would like to see anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how I generate a DOM element in my Model. This element needs validation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Model.ascx\n&lt;div class=\"detailsRow required\"&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Site) %&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedSiteID, new SelectList(Model.Site, \"Key\", \"Value\"))%&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedSiteID)%&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n//Model.cs\n[DisplayName(\"Site\")]\npublic List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; Site { get; set; }\n\n[Range(0, int.MaxValue, ErrorMessage = \"Site required\")]\npublic int SelectedSiteID { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Site is a select list which starts with a value of -1. Any other selection is valid. As such, I validate on a range from 0 to max.</p>\n\n<p>Over in JavaScript, I run the following code against my form when the user presses the 'Submit' button on the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var form = workflowDialogContent.find('form');\n$.validator.unobtrusive.parse(form);\n//Maintain a reference to the current formValidator to be able to reset.\nvar formValidator = $.data(form[0], 'validator');\n\nif (form.valid()) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user pressed submit, the form is validated and my validation message is shown if the selected site has a value of -1.</p>\n\n<p>Now, whenever the a selection is changed, I want to reset my form. I've taken this logic from: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2086287/how-to-clear-jquery-validation-error-messages\">How to clear Jquery validation error messages?</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>$(window).on('change', '#SelectedSiteID', function () {\n    //Returns the formValidator we maintained a reference to.\n    var validator = WorkflowDialogBuilder.getCurrentFormValidator();\n    validator.resetForm();\n    //TODO: resetForm's documentation says that it hides the errors, but I did not experience this, so I am doing it manually.\n    //$('.field-validation-error').empty();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I run this code... the highlighting is removed, but the error messages remain. If I call the bit of commented code -- the validation errors are hidden, but they do not re-appear the next time my form is validated.</p>\n\n<p>After validating:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0gNqs.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\nAfter calling resetForm:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKqw0.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Any ideas why I would be seeing such behavior?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> As a work around, the following bit of code seems to do proper clean-up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('.field-validation-error').empty();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1870,"score":5,"question_id":2111936,"title":"How do I see which version of MVC is installed?","body":"<p>How can I tell which version of MVC (i.e. MVC 2 Beta, MVC 2 RC) is installed on my machine?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13259641,"title":"Should I add a field like MarkedAsDeleted to my table?","body":"<p>I'm building an ASP.NET MVC application with SQL Server.

I read the release notes and updated accordingly but still encountered an issue with WebMatrix. I found a SO question where someone from the MVC team suggested until RTM we use the following to force the namespaces to be pulled in (I put them in web.config but it didn't work).</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace WebMatrix.Data { class Foo { } }\nnamespace WebMatrix.WebData { class Foo { } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This solved my issue within the website and the website now loads up fine in MVC 3 RC. The problem however, is an external MVC area (separate assembly).</p>\n\n<p>Note I'm not using any third party libraries for this, I wrote a little plugin framework that allows loading an MVC area from another assembly. Views are compiled as embedded resources.</p>\n\n<p>So I have an authentication plugin for example that looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>-Controllers\n-- AccountController.cs\n-Models\n-- AccountModels.cs\n-Views\n--Account\n--- LogOn.cshtml\n--- ChangePassword.cshtml\n--- ...\n-Web.config\nAccountAreaRegistration.cs\nWeb.config\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Other than the fact that the views are marked as embedded resources, the AccountController extending  a PluginController that knows how to load the embedded resouces and the global.asax being removed, its a pretty standard MVC area.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried creating a new empty MVC 3 test plugin project and slowly adding in the relevant code. This ensures all references and web.configs are correct. But I still receive the same model issue described above. The project compiles at design time but throws a compilation issue at runtime when it tries to emit the views it looks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just to be clear, this all works fine in ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1</strong>. However, now that I have upgraded it to MVC 3 RC I have the core website working but the external area refuses to work.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing wrong the the plugin framework itself. It works fine in MVC 3 Preview 1. I'm looking for answers that might shed a little bit of light on what may be occuring in MVC 3 RC and why I might be using receiving this model error.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly if I change the declaration of the model at the top of the view to Preview 1 syntax `@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage</p>\n\n<p>I get a different runtime compiler error. This time I get an error just further down when the Html.ValidationSummary begins for the login form.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage&lt;TestProject.Models.LogOnModel&gt;\n@{\n    View.Title = \"Log On\";\n}\n&lt;div class=\"content_item half loginform\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content_body\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;VastID Login&lt;/h1&gt;\n        @Html.ValidationSummary(true, \"Login was unsuccessful.

Google would also consider it duplicate content and penalize one of them to avoid duplicates in their results.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, the URLs are not case sensitive, so we actually get the same content for these URLs too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mydomain.com/Home/Index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/home/index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/Home/index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/home/Index</li>\n<li>(the list goes on)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, the question...

Here it's probably worth to mention I only have six month of experience behind my back.</p>\n\n<p>Now I know what topics I can research into additionally if I want to understand the framework better in terms of performance. Unfortunately most of the information on the Internet is outdated or bloated with subjectivity, hence my inability to find any additional information on the <em>Warm</em> vs <em>Cold</em> queries topic.</p>\n\n<p>Basically what I've noticed so far is that whenever I have to recompile or the recycling hits in, my initial queries are getting very slow. Any subsequent data read is fast (<em>subjective</em>), as expected.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be migrating to Windows Server 2012, IIS8 and SQL Server 2012 and as a Junior I actually won myself the opportunity to test them before the rest. I'm very happy they introduced a warming-up module that will get my application ready for that first request.

Now I observe that the email textbox takes the red border, but there is no message.</p>\n\n<p>Do you see what I am missing now and if it's possible to use complex type and validations?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, the _ClientForm is called from this Client view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@model CardNumbers.Objects.Client\n\n@{\n    ViewBag.Title = \"Client\";\n}\n\n@section scripts {\n    &lt;script src=\"@Url.Content(\"~/Scripts/Clients.js\")\" type=\"text/javascript\" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n}\n\n &lt;form id=\"frmClientsSearch\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"clientNo\"&gt;Client No: &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"number\" name=\"searchClientNo\" class=\"numericOnly\" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"clientName\"&gt;Client Name: &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type =  \"text\" size =25 value =\"Please enter the search value\" class=\"SelectOnEntry\"\n            name =\"searchClientName\" /&gt;\n\n       &lt;input type=\"button\" id=\"btnClientsSearch\" value =\"Find / Refresh\" /&gt;      \n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"padding-left: 150px; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\" id=\"ClientsResults\"&gt;\n    &lt;table id=\"flexClients\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"display: none\"&gt;\n   &lt;form id=\"sform\" title=\"Client Info\"&gt;\n\n\n        @{Html.RenderPartial(\"_ClientForm\", Model)   ;}\n\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13236998,"title":"Url.Action returning different url on different part of site","body":"<p>I have a line in a partial that is included in 2 different views on my site:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Url.Action(\"SomeController\", \"SomeAction\", { userID = \"foo\" })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am noticing that the URL this is generating is very different depending on which page I'm on.

My site is a project collaboration site where users can be assigned to one or more projects on the site. Tasks are then added to projects, and users with in a project can be assigned to tasks. So a \"User\" is a fundamental concept of my domain model. </p>\n\n<p>My plan is to have a \"User\" model object which contains all the information about a user and can be accessed through an IUserRepository. Each user can be identified by a UserId. Although I'm not sure at this point if I want the UserId to be a string or integer.</p>\n\n<p>How should my domain objects User and IUserRepository relate to the more administrative functions of my site like authorizing users and allowing them to login? How would I integrate my domain model with other aspects of ASP.NET such as HttpContext.User, HttpContext.Profile, a custom MemberShipProvider, a custom ProfileProvider, or custom AuthorizeAttribute? </p>\n\n<p>Should I create a custom MembershipProvider and or ProfileProvider which wraps my IUserRepository? Although, I can also foresee why I may want to separate the User information in my domain model from the authorization of a user on my site. For example in the future I may want to switch to windows authentication from forms authentication. </p>\n\n<p>Would it be better to not try and reinvent the wheel and stick with the standard SqlMembershipProvider built into ASP.NET? Each user's profile information would be stored in the domain model (User/IUserRepository), but this would not include their password. I would then use the standard ASP.NET membership stuff to handle creating and authorizing users? So there would need to be some code somewhere that would know to create a profile for a new users in the IUserRepository when their account is created or the first time they login.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","generics","inheritance","controllers"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":13217960,"title":"generics vs inheritance in mvc controllers","body":"<p>We have a number of controllers with very similar functionality, there is a lot of code duplication.

I assume it belongs in some kind of model other than an activerecord model and I didn't think a service was the proper place though I could be wrong...\nAlso would you say this logic is domain logic or presentation logic?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","regex","asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":1,"question_id":13214255,"title":"Match at least one character and one number, regardless of order, with no suffix?","body":"<p>I need a RegEx that fulfills this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>There is at least one character and one digit, regardless of order, and there is no suffix (i.e. domain name) at the end.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I have this test list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ra182\njas182\nra1z4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I have this RegEx:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[a-z]+[0-9]+$\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's matching the first two fully, but it's only matching the <code>z4</code> in the last one.

If sent with POST, updates tab id 1. </p>\n\n<p>widgetAPI.com/tabs/1/widgets > Returns all widgetInstances of tab id 1. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Ideally I'd like to follow the design of widgetAPI.com/tabs/1 also returning all the widgetInstances of the given tab but with that design, widgetAPI.com/tabs may return far too much data as I would have to return all the widgets for all the tabs. Hence I need to create a separate \"widgetAPI.com/tabs/1/widgets\" URL but that also has to return the tab meta data as I don't want to make two HTTP calls to get meta data &amp; widgets.

Updates 123 if sent through POST. </p>\n\n<p>widgetAPI.com/widgets/Create?typeID = 2 -> Creates a new widgetInstance of typeid = 2. This will only be a POST request so typeId could be a post parameter.</p>\n\n<p>widgetAPI.com/widgets/delete/123 -> Delete widgetInstance 123</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong> So there is one rule I havent been able to fulfill yet. I need to return all the widgetTypes available and I am not sure how to fit this request into the previous two controllers. I am currently leaning towards just serving this separately. So something like widgetAPI.com/getWidgetTypes. Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks guys.

Please suggest which option is better and why.Currently I have 2 implementations as below.</p>\n\n<p>1) I am loading 3 partial views on demand in 3 different jQuery tabs. On demand means when user clicks on a particular tab, I call associated controller action (using GET) using Ajax and populate the model object that feeds the partial view. Whenever user clicks on other tabs and comes back to the previous one, since we are loading tab data on every request, the new request data wipes out the user entered data. To prevent this, I intend to use a Javascript object (one object per tab) that maps to model object. I will update the global javascript object whenever user changes data in the controls.This will allow me to get the current data. When user clicks on submit, (only 1 submit button, no 'Save' button for individual tabs) I post the JS object to the controller using Ajax. The controller action (using POST) will be executed and I can use the model object for further processing.  </p>\n\n<p>2) Another option is load all the tabs in the application at once with all dropdowns filled in. Let the user edit the data. I will capture the data in one global javascript (one object per tab) when user updates fields on the web page. When user clicks on submit, (only 1 submit button, no 'Save' button for individual tabs) I post the JS object to the controller using Ajax. The controller action (using POST) will be executed and I can use the model object for further processing returning partial view (or JSON ?) as response. </p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you have anything to improve in any of the two approaches. </p>\n\n<p>In actual application there could 10-15 tabs with lots of controls so it is really important for me to get clear understanding on the approach so as not to land in trouble in future due to improper design. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":1,"question_id":13201319,"title":"ASP.NET MVC append div to body","body":"<p>I make a customize controller about calendar.

It's a proper model created through LINQ to SQL mapped to an SQL Server database table. An example instance/row would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PropertyFeatureID: 2\nDescription: \"Swimming Pool\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The number of rows (PropertyFeatures) can of course grow and shrink, and so I want to dynamically render a list of checkboxes so that the user can select any of them.\nI can dynamically render the Checkboxes easily enough, with something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%foreach (var Feature in (ViewData[\"Features\"] as IEnumerable&lt;MySolution.Models.PropertyFeature&gt;)) { %&gt;\n&lt;%=Html.CheckBox(\"Features\", new { @id = Feature.PropertyFeatureID, @value = Feature.PropertyFeatureID })%&gt;&lt;label for=\"Feature&lt;%=Feature.PropertyFeatureID%&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%=Feature.Description%&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;%}%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I specify the ID for each checkbox and render the matching label so that the user can intuitively click the label and toggle the checkbox - that works great.</p>\n\n<p>I set the CheckBox's \"name\" to \"Features\" so all the checkboxes render with the same name, and the MVC Model Binder piles them into a single collection called \"Features\" when the form is posted. This works nicely.</p>\n\n<p>Once the form is submitted, I use the checked values and store them, so I need the actual integer values so I know which PropertyFeature is selected, not just a pile of Booleans and field names. So ideally, I want it as an array or a collection that's easy to work with.</p>\n\n<p>I am able to retrieve the selected values from within my Controller method when the button is clicked because I have specified the parameter as int[] Features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But the problem</strong> is that it doesn't maintain state. That is, when I click the submit button and the page reloads (with the form again displayed) I want all of the dynamic checkboxes to retain their checked status (or not). All of the other fields that I've created with <code>Html.DropDownList</code> and <code>Html.TextBox</code> all maintain their states successfully no problems at all on the same page in the same form.</p>\n\n<p>I have spent hours reading all of the other threads and articles on similar issues and there is a lot of talk about using <code>ICollection</code> and <code>IDictionary</code> to bundle things up and include a Boolean value for each item so that it can maintain the checkbox state. But I don't 100% grasp how to use that in the context of my own personal example.

The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This puzzled me as we are using EF and the connection handling should have been automatic.</p>\n\n<p>So I started digging. The first potential culprit I considered was MiniProfiler (or I should say, our implementation of using miniprofiler). We have been using this and it has been working well, but I was worried about potential connection leaks.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public OurContext() : base(GetProfilerConnection(), true)\n    {}\n\n    private static DbConnection GetProfilerConnection()\n    {\n        return new EFProfiledDbConnection(new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"Database\"].ConnectionString),\n                                          MiniProfiler.Current);\n    }       \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was under the impression that the \"true\" parameter in the base call caused the context to take ownership of the connection so I believe that this should work fine and the connection will be disposed of.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8X4Qq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In our Enhancement DEV branch I've removed miniprofiler as it has not been updated to support EF5 and we're going to be migrating at some point in the not too distant future, so this should be removed as a concern.</p>\n\n<p>Concern two was \"are we disposing our datacontexts properly\"? So I downloaded Entity Framework Profiler on a trial and took our heaviest page and ran a test.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3CxJr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The results showed explicitly that any context we opened was closed, the concerning part to me however is the number of contexts we open. We have our DI container (Ninject 2) setup to instatiate one context per web http request, which I'd\nconsider correct. The problem comes into pay with how we handle images in our application. This page in particular can have up to seven images in the database. Each of these images is included in the page via a MVC action.\nLike so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[&lt;img src=\"/Controller/GetPhotoAction/[ImageId] /&gt;]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the image is a separte request a separate context is being opened. So, for this particular page, we are utilizing seven different connections from the connection pool if I'm understanding this correctly. Multiply this by however many users and I see\nhow the error message above could be true.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for storing images in the database is twofold. One, our administrative application to manage the data for this app is on the US West Coast, but the servers hosting the application are on the US East Coast. There is a \nVPN tunnel between our network here at work on the West Coast and the servers on the East Coast. The app is load balanced as well (2 web front ends). The decision was made to store the images in the DB to avoid copying the images \nthrough a VPN tunnel and then dealing with permissions to writing the images to a file location within the web app on each server (the two locations are also completely different domains). </p>\n\n<p>In the interim, while we test, we have upped the max connection pool size in our connection string and will be deploying this out to PROD early next week.</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Have I covered my bases in leak checking here? I believe I have. Am I wrong in anything I stated above?</p>\n\n<p>2) If the multiple data contexts on this page prove to be the culprit, suggestions on how to write an image to two servers across the country keeping in mind permissions will cross domains? Realistically, I'd like to do this anway,\nbut the technical hurdles are a bit more than we are willing to do at this time right before the holidays.</p>\n\n<p>3) If you think neither of the above are problems, what could I be missing? Could it really be that requests are high enough that we're encountering this error and we need to scale out? I can dig up logs to view use statistics, but it\nseems unlikely. This page is cached for an hour (there is a vary by param) </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","jquery","asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-3"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":81,"score":0,"question_id":13166253,"title":"MVC3 DropDownList - Modify data being displayed in form on SelectedIndexChanged?","body":"<p>I have two DropDownList elements in my model. </p>\n\n<pre><code>[DisplayName(\"Site\")]\npublic List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; Site { get; set; }\npublic int SelectedSiteID { get; set; }\n&lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedSiteID, new SelectList(Model.Site, \"Key\", \"Value\"))%&gt;\n\n[DisplayName(\"Data Center\")]\npublic List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; DataCenter { get; set; }\npublic int SelectedDataCenterID { get; set; }\n&lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedDataCenterID, new SelectList(Model.DataCenter, \"Key\", \"Value\"))%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am attempting to modify the collection of ListItem's in my second DropDownList when the user makes a change to the first's selection.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this is possible in the following manner, but I wanted to confirm that this was good practice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using jQuery, bind to the first DropDownList's change event.</li>\n<li>When responding to the change event -- send an AJAX request to the server with the newly selected value.</li>\n<li>The server will respond with JSON representing a collection of ListItem objects for the second DropDownList.</li>\n<li>Using jQuery, I modify the second DropDownList's selection such that it contains the returned JSON elements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This all seems a bit... non-MVC3y, if you will.

Success!\nHowever, I thought I would double-check this, so I commented out the LazyLoadingEnabled parameter, did a clean rebuild and it still worked. I commented out the default constructor and now it still works - did something else change when I ran it with the LazyLoadingEnabled parameter in place?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","asp.net-mvc","telerik-mvc"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":1,"question_id":13092630,"title":"Get an error when trying to populate a telerik ddl at page load","body":"<p>How can I populate a telerik drop-down list at page load?</p>\n\n<p>I get the following error(at emphasized line below) when I try to populate dropdownlist:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: 'data(...)' is null or not an object\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is how I try to populate the telerik ddl:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(function(){\nvar values = [];\nfor (var i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) { \n\nvalues.push({ Text: i, Value: i });\n}\n****$(\"#MyDdl\").data(\"tDropDownList\").dataBind(values);****\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Tried it this way as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code> $(function(){\n    onDataBinding();\n    });\n\nfunction onDataBinding(e) {\n        var MyDdl = $('#MyDdl').data('tDropDownList');\n        var values = [];\n        for (var i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {  \n    values.push({ Text: i, Value: i });\n    }\n      ****MyDdl.dataBind(values);****\n    };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But get following undefined error at emphasized line above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: 'undefined' is null or not an object\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note:\nAdding a button and loading the ddl on button click event does populate telerik drop-down list.\nDoing it this way works perfectly fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $(function(){\n   var values = [];\n        for (var i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {             \n        values.push({ Text: i, Value: i });\n        }\n        $(\"#MyDdl\").data(\"tDropDownList\").dataBind(values);            \n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","twitter-bootstrap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13169662,"title":"Submitting twitter bootstrapper tabs, with asp.net mvc 3 partial view","body":"<p>I am having a twitter bootstraper tab, with 3 simples tabs (Caracteristiques, Certificat and Contrats)</p>\n\n<p>the tabs are ajax load with asp.net mvc partialviews, they are tied with modelViews:</p>\n\n<p>the partials views strongly tied to the type ViewModel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    // Load Certificat\n    public ActionResult Certificat()\n    {\n        var modelStaffs = _twitterTabsModel.GetStaffs();\n\n        return PartialView(\"_Certificat\", modelStaffs);\n    }\n\n    // load Contrats\n    public ActionResult Contrats()\n    {\n        var modelJoueur = _twitterTabsModel.GetFirstJoueur();\n\n        return PartialView(\"_Contrats\", modelJoueur );\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the models:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class TwitterTabModel\n{\n    public ModelJoueur JoueurVM { get; set; }\n    public IEnumerable&lt;ModelStaff&gt; StaffVM { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class ModelStaff\n{\n    public string NomStaff { get; set; }\n    public string FonctionStaff { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class ModelJoueur\n{\n    public string NomJoueur { get; set; }\n    public string PrenomJoueur { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the Caracteristiques Tab views:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@model Controls.Models.ViewModel.TwitterTabModel\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Caracteristiques&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n@using (Html.BeginForm())\n{\n.... the tabs code ...\n    &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Save\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The tabs load fines, what I want to do is to include a submit button on the first razor view tab, it submit all the other models if loaded, however, when I get the post call, all the others models, JoueurVM and StaffVM are empty even though they are loaded.

Again, What's the right way of doing this?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I haven't yet decided how I'll pass the parameters to the rendering form: I could use both query parameters or POST them.

Most of the time, letting Routing sort out which\n  route you want to use to generate a URL is really leaving it to chance, which is not something that\n  sits well with the obsessive-compulsive control freak developer. When generating a URL, you generally\n  know exactly which route you want to link to, so you might as well specify it by name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mentioned section discusses a very similar situation to the one I described. </p>\n\n<p>But since <code>Html.ActionLink()</code> doesn't have an overload with the route name parameter, does this mean I cannot reliably use it anywhere in the entire app if have a route like this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","entity-framework","web-config","connection-string"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":1,"question_id":13093754,"title":"MVC3 Entity Connection string disappearing","body":"<p>I am having a very frustrating problem with my current project.

For the ones that authentication is mandatory where I initially used the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Authorize()]\npublic class SomeController : BaseController\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which works as expected and returns a <strong>401 Status Code (Unauthorized)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem starts on the page that allows anonymous. Because those pages have parts that uses RenderAction to render pieces <strong>that requires authentication</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>On local developpement server on front end everything looks fine, but with <strong>IIS</strong> any page that have any small piece that requires authentication it returns 401 page. So I created a custom Authorize attribute:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CustomAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute\n{\n    public bool Ignore401ChildAction { get; set; }\n\n    public CustomAuthorizeAttribute()\n        : base() {\n        this.Ignore401ChildAction = true;\n    }\n\n    protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequest( AuthorizationContext filterContext ) {\n        base.HandleUnauthorizedRequest( filterContext );\n        if( this.Ignore401ChildAction &amp;&amp; filterContext.IsChildAction ) {\n            filterContext.HttpContext.Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then on frontend it seems to produce correct behavior with and without IIS. However in the backend, even if the page renders completly it returns a 401</p>\n\n<p>So I added the following to my CustomAttribute instead of <strong>TrySkipIisCustomErrors</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>filterContext.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 200;\nfilterContext.Result = new EmptyResult();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In anonymous everything is fine, but when NTLM is enabled server doesn't request authentication when the controller doesnt have that CustomAuthorize attribute. It seems like its only requesting the crendetials when their mandatory instead of when they're available.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>After lot of searching, digging and fiddling, realized that true problem is that Anonymous identification will take precedence over Windows/NTLM.

The problem occurs when the user session expires and an ajax action method is asked to execute. The asp.net Authentication system sends 302 redirect instead of sending 401 which seems logical for non-ajax requests. But with Ajax it all gets messed up quickly. So I decided to follow the approach suggested at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3431343/asp-net-mvc-forces-an-ajax-request-be-redirected-to-the-login-page-when-the-form\">ASP.NET MVC forces an AJAX request be redirected to the login page when the FormsLogin session is no longer active</a> . \n   Basically, at the end of request we check whether the request is an ajax request and there is a redirect (302 response). If it is then we replace the response code from 302 to 401. Accordingly in the javascript we check for 401 and perform redirection from there.

Maybe using reflections?\nthanks</p>\n\n<pre><code>        [HttpPost]\n    public ActionResult Edit(ContentPage row)\n    {\n        var sb = new StringBuilder();\n\n    if (row.Template.RuntimeTypeName == \"TwoColumn\")\n    {\n        TwoColumnTemplate template = (TwoColumnTemplate)row.Template;\n    } \n    else\n    {\n        SingleColumnTemplate template = (SingleColumnTemplate)row.Template;\n    }\n\n        return this.View(row);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":2897,"score":-1,"question_id":5078131,"title":"Print Page functionality in MVC","body":"<p>Anyone done this in MVC? any info would be great!.\nThanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-3","asp.net-mail"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":239,"score":0,"question_id":5078161,"title":"Email a Friend functionality in MVC","body":"<p>Pretty much there would be an icon on the site. clicking it would bring up a pop up window with following fieds:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>you would then be able to fill out the page and an email would be sent to \"email\" provided in the \"Email\" field.

That's not the problem here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What the problem is</strong>: I can't get this to resolve...it doesn't find my controller and action in the jQuery getJSON request 'Search/Member/26049'</p>\n\n<p>** The error I get in FireBug**:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://localhost/OurappName/Search/Member/26049 404 Not Found\n        19ms\nin the response:\n&lt;b&gt; Requested URL: &lt;/b&gt;/ballysearch/Search/Member/26049&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>What I've Tried</strong>: Originally in my area's route config, I had that first line at the end so tried moving it up.  I'm talking about the context.MapRoute(\"Search_Member_GetMemberByContractNumber\", \"Search/Member/{id}\"..I had that after my default route.

That's because I'm only trying to just test this $.ajax() function out and later I'll add a form and invoke that call from some event.  So that should not matter, that I don't have a form element yet right?  I simply have $.ajax call at the top of my view in the open so it fires off on its own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> It seems like it's hitting my routes ok as you can see above.  I just wonder if it's how I'm forming my $.ajax() call in terms of the callback and maybe related to, my controller method is not fully correct?  I'm returning json from my action but it's ok to have how I have it I assume.  I don't know, unless I can try something different in my action method that's returning the json.  I don't know if my $.ajax call needs to specify the return type expected in the callback now that I just thought about it as I am typing this but I'll check that also.</p>\n\n<p>for example when I setup the $.ajax call like this (see below), I'm getting a response back so I think that tells me IIS is able to send a response after it hit my route and controller ok.  So I'm thinking it's my action method that's not returning a correct json object, not really sure but at this point, if the route debugger from Phil Haack shows it's definitely hitting my routes, then it can't be that...the ajax call IS hitting my route.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>   $.ajax({\n        url: 'OurApp/Search/Member/26049',\n        type: \"GET\",\n        dataType: \"json\",\n        success: function (response) \n        {\n            alert('we got a mother fing response!');\n            grid = new Slick.Grid(\"#memberSearchResults-Grid\", response.data, columns, options);\n        },\n        error: function (e) { alert('response error: '); }\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so I get the alert for the error case above, it's hitting this.  I don't know if I will always get a response...probably I assume IIS would respond in a failed request AND successful route request...?</p>\n\n<p>I tried to attach to the worker process and then refresh the page after setting a debug point on the first line of that action method that's returning json in my controller but that line is never hit.  I don't know why.  I can't get any debug points hit, not </p>\n\n<p>Here's the request header from firebug just for additional info:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GET http://localhost/OurApp/Search/Member/26049 HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nProxy-Connection: keep-alive\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's some of the resopnse and what's interesting is even though it shows my route is being hit on my controller, this error says no, it isn't hitting your controller so I'm so dumbfounded at this point on wtf is going on and where:</p>\n\n<p>HeadersResponseCacheHTML</p>\n\n<p>\n    \n        The resource cannot be found.\n        \n         body {font-family:\"Verdana\";font-weight:normal;font-size: .7em;color:black;} \n         p {font-family:\"Verdana\";font-weight:normal;color:black;margin-top: -5px}\n         b {font-family:\"Verdana\";font-weight:bold;color:black;margin-top: -5px}\n         H1 { font-family:\"Verdana\";font-weight:normal;font-size:18pt;color:red }\n         H2 { font-family:\"Verdana\";font-weight:normal;font-size:14pt;color:maroon }\n         pre {font-family:\"Lucida Console\";font-size: .9em}\n         .marker {font-weight: bold; color: black;text-decoration: none;}\n         .version {color: gray;}\n         .error {margin-bottom: 10px;}\n         .expandable { text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold; color:navy; cursor:hand; }\n        \n    </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body bgcolor=\"white\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;span&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Server Error in '/OurApp' Application.&lt;hr width=100% size=1 color=silver&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;\n\n        &lt;h2&gt; &lt;i&gt;The resource cannot be found.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif \"&gt;\n\n        &lt;b&gt; Description: &lt;/b&gt;HTTP 404.

For example we have some available tasks that user can schedule whenever he wants.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't want to reinvent the wheel and found the Quartz.Net library that can be used to create the scheduler.</p>\n\n<p>I know that it's not a good idea to host scheduling inside webapp cause webserver can recycle the application pools, etc, so i decided to use it inside a Windows Service and then using Quartz.NET remoting feature to trigger tasks inside my webapp.</p>\n\n<p>But i've found some issues with that. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when i tried to use the Quartz.NET remoting it runs the job inside the Windows Service process, it means that it needs to know about all types inside my webapp, so all the assemblies of the webapp should be referenced by it, and i need to have another config file for database, etc. So in case I write new job class, i can't easily schedule it, i need to stop the service and renew the library for it, so it's not very generic approach.</p>\n\n<p>I can't find any info that Quartz.NET can run jobs only based on it's interface.</p>\n\n<p>So I came up with idea to write my own scheduler that will be hosted in the Windows Service, and will have some IJob interface that will be implemented in the webapp. I will also use .Net remoting using IPC channel. \nSo the webapp will be like .Net Remoting Server, and when i want to add some new job and then schedule it, i will just have to write new job that implements IJob interface. \nI will register it as </p>\n\n<pre><code>        IpcChannel channel = new IpcChannel(\"CurrentIPC\");\n\n        ChannelServices.RegisterChannel(channel);\n\n        RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownServiceType(\n            typeof(SimpleJob), \"SimpleJob\", WellKnownObjectMode.SingleCall);\n        RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownServiceType(\n            typeof(ComplexObject), \"ComplexObject\", WellKnownObjectMode.SingleCall);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in this case i will have two Job types registered. Then when scheduling the job i will pass the name of the class and on the Windows Service side that will stand for client (executing objects on the webapp side) i will just bind the passed name of the class with IJob like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, IJob&gt; jobs = new Dictionary&lt;string, IJob&gt;();\n    void AddJob(string name)\n    {\n        IJob obj = (IJob)Activator.GetObject(typeof(IJob), string.Format(\"ipc://CurrentIPC/{0}\", name));\n        jobs.Add(name, obj);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now i don't need to bother about references to my app and other stuff, the scheduler will do it's job without knowing anything, just IJob interface and executing tasks on the webapp side.</p>\n\n<p>If i'm wrong or it's too complex and there are some other simpler methods of doing this, or there are some pitfalls that i'm not aware of, can you help me with that?\nThank you.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. \nAlso there was an idea to have separate scheduler that will run the web app methods directly by executing a link to specified service in the web app, for example \"http://localhost:3030/Request/12\" and that's all, but in my web app you should be authorized to execute such request and again we have issues we need to resolve, and we will have additional load to the webserver with such requests in case of thousands of scheduled tasks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13106354,"title":"How to serialize each item in IEnumerable for ajax post","body":"<p>I have a PartialView that displays <code>IEnumerable&lt;Movie&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>_MoviePartial.cshtml</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>@foreach(var movie in Model) {\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"image\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"@movie.Posters.Profile\" alt=\"@movie.Title\"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"title\"&gt;@movie.Title&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"score`\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"critics-score\"&gt;@movie.Ratings.CriticsScore&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"audience-score\"&gt;@movie.Ratings.AudienceScore&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        @Html.ActionLink(\"Add Movie\", \"Add\", \"MyMovies\")\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user clicks the \"Add Movie\" ActionLink I am going to do an ajax post to add the selected movie to the users collection.
