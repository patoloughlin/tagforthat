Then the device will poll the server and get the data. For achieving this, I used Google's cloud messaging service (Earlier c2dm) for Android, Apple push notification service for iPhone and MPNS for Windows phone. But now the client says our server cannot, rather shouldn't communicate with a 3rd party like Google/Apple/Microsoft servers for pushing the notification. I am forced to search for alternatives. I have implemented MQTT in Android and it is serving the purpose, also in Apple it will wokr without any issue. Now I am trying the same for wp7, but can't find any working MQTT client, does Microsoft restrict us to use 3rd party services to push? If not where can I get a working MQTT client for windows phone 7? Also if that is not possible, does Microsoft allow XMPP or not?

Is there anyone who tell me the complete procedure to integrate the plugins? And also how to add plugin entry in the WMAppManifest.xml file?\nThanks in advance....</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":13103102,"title":"Test Windows phone apps without paying for dev center account?","body":"<p>It appears Microsoft would like £65 before I can test an app on my own phone.

Here's the method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnNavigatedTo(System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs e)\n{\n    base.OnNavigatedTo(e);\n    this.DataContext = null;\n    this.DataContext = Settings.NotesList;\n    Settings.CurrentNoteIndex = -1;\n    TheListBox.SelectedIndex = -1;\n    if (Settings.NotesList.Count &lt;= 0) // EXCEPTION\n    {\n        NoteStatus.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;\n        TheListBox.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        NoteStatus.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed;\n        TheListBox.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where in a separate file I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class Settings\n{\n    static Settings() { }\n    public static ObservableCollection&lt;Note&gt; NotesList;\n    static IsolatedStorageSettings settings;\n    private static int currentNoteIndex;\n    public static int CurrentNoteIndex { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wanted to test the program before writing any more but I'm not sure what's causing this. The OnNavigatedTo is from launching the application so I never even get to MainPage.xaml. Help is very appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","qt","windows-phone-7","bluetooth","symbian"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13093367,"title":"Symbian Windows Phone bluetooth communication","body":"<p>If wanted to communicate bluetooth messages between Symbian and Windows Phone using Qt and C# respectively,how would I go about it?

I was assuming that long polling would be able to keep connections open much longer?</li>\n<li>SignalR doesn't use Websockets, which is enabled on the server and does work with another library (Websockets4Net). The client does submit the TryWebSockets parameter with true.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm especially curious about issue 1 and 2, as I'm worried that this behavior would give a heavy load on the server.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I have now also tried connecting to the same SignalR server using the JavaScript implementation. This actually does use Websockets. When I disable Websockets the long polling works perfectly, keeping the connection open for a long time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":13063846,"title":"listbox performance in WP7","body":"<p>I have a Itemscontrol nested within a listbox.DataTemplate consits of image and border controls.The listbox scrolling is pretty slow.How can i improve its performance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","windows-phone-7.1"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13068228,"title":"WP7 Reminder with NavigationUri when phone is blocked issue","body":"<p>When <code>Reminder</code> created with set path in <code>NavigationUri</code> param have such issue:\nwhen phone is blocked (under locked screen) and reminder shown, it's impossible to navigate to the app using Tap on title or content of the reminder message.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to solve such problem, or it's ussual behaviour for reminder and lock screen?</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","xaml","windows-phone-7.1"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13064355,"title":"DataTemplate in pivotItems wp7","body":"<p>I would like to create a pivotpage in wp7:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;Grid x:Name=\"LayoutRoot\" Background=\"Transparent\"&gt;\n    &lt;!--Pivot Control--&gt;\n    &lt;controls:Pivot Title=\"MY APPLICATION\"&gt;\n        &lt;!--Pivot item one--&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem Header=\"item1\"&gt;\n            &lt;Grid/&gt;\n        &lt;/controls:PivotItem&gt;\n\n        &lt;!--Pivot item two--&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem Header=\"item2\"&gt;\n            &lt;Grid/&gt;\n        &lt;/controls:PivotItem&gt;\n    &lt;/controls:Pivot&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need that the pivoItems will be binded automatically with my  <code>List&lt;Article&gt;</code> and class Article are defined like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class Article\n{\n    private string _logoUrl;\n    public string LogoUrl\n    {\n        get { return _logoUrl; }\n        set { _logoUrl = value; }\n    }\n    private string _title;\n    public string Title\n    {\n        get { return _title; }\n        set { _title = value; }\n    }\n    private string _descrption;\n    public string Descrption\n    {\n        get { return _descrption; }\n        set { _descrption = value; }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I use Datatemplate to bind each PivotItem with each Article (I need that the title of each Article will be showd in the header of PivotItem and the description in webbrowser because it's a HTML)</p>\n\n<p>Best regards </p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2660,"score":0,"question_id":4344952,"title":"Looking for a DataGrid Control","body":"<p>I have been trying to find both built-in datagrid control and third party datagrid control for windows phone 7 but with no luck.

Can you do interactivity in Expression blend at all?</p>\n\n<p>From what I can gather (again I'm not sure about this), one works with both these applications. Expression Blend for the UI, and Visual Studio for the back-end/interactivity. Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the above is correct. How do you go about this?

I am loading all the details in one shot and that too from a server endpoint serving this JSON. The obvious problem I faced was the caching. It was always loading the stale copy. But I tackled this issue by adding a dummy URL paramater at the end.</p>\n\n<p>However, the JSON changes very rarely. So I still need to utilize the caching technique that the WebClient automatically uses. To do this I initially request a call to the server's JSON version something like, <code>http://myserver/JSONVersion</code>. This JSONVersion gets updated any time JSON is updated. </p>\n\n<p>Once I get it, i append it to my url <code>http://myserver/myjson.json?v=(JSONVERSION)</code>. This has solved my entire problem. However, I feel this is very ugly and has unnecessary excess code+logic floating around. I am hoping the HTTP Cache headers have a work around similar to the one that I am having. If so, please let me know.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","panorama-control","application-bar"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1727,"score":0,"question_id":6589823,"title":"WP7 Panorama control sliding lagging when hiding Application Bar","body":"<p>I have a Windows Phone app with panorama control.</p>\n\n<p>Panorama currently has two pages. </p>\n\n<p>One page should have a visible application bar with buttons, and another one should not.</p>\n\n<p>I use the panorama's SelectionChanged event to chage the IsVisible property of the ApplicationBar.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void Panorama_SelectionChanged(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            ApplicationBar.IsVisible = Panorama.SelectedIndex == 0;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The functionality I get is as desired, but with such behaviour, I get a terrible lagging (a momentary freeze of sliding animation) of my panorama.

But I did not found any sample code which will do this.</p>\n\n<p>Please help me to find sample.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","windows-phone-7","wcf-client"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":130,"score":0,"question_id":11074445,"title":"Empty config file when referencing WCF in WP7 App","body":"<p>I am trying to consume my own WCF service from a WP7 app.</p>\n\n<p>The Config File in the WCF Service </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;configuration&gt;\n\n  &lt;system.web&gt;\n    &lt;compilation debug=\"true\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/system.web&gt;  \n  &lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;services&gt;\n\n      &lt;service name=\"mergedServices.MergedService\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.RelationGeneratorServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.keywordSearchServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.QAServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.CompareWithOnePredicateInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.ComparisonServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"mex\" binding=\"mexHttpBinding\" contract=\"IMetadataExchange\" /&gt;\n        &lt;host&gt;\n          &lt;baseAddresses&gt;\n            &lt;add baseAddress=\"http://localhost:8732/Design_Time_Addresses/mergedServices/\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/baseAddresses&gt;\n        &lt;/host&gt;\n      &lt;/service&gt;\n\n    &lt;/services&gt;\n    &lt;behaviors&gt;\n      &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;\n        &lt;behavior&gt;\n          &lt;!-- To avoid disclosing metadata information, \n          set the value below to false and remove the metadata endpoint above before deployment --&gt;\n          &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\"/&gt;\n          &lt;!-- To receive exception details in faults for debugging purposes, \n          set the value below to true.

For some reason, I cannot get the grid to remember which elements have been added already. I am unsure of how to store this information so that when the MainPage is navigated from, and then back to, the grid knows which values were previously added. To better explain, what I have is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>MainPage.xaml</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=\"BrowserHost\" Grid.Row=\"1\"&gt;\n    //Items will be added in code behind\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>MainPage.xaml.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void ShowTab(int index) \n    {\n        this.currentIndex = index;\n        int count = Settings.BrowserList.Value.Count;\n\n        if (count &lt;= 0)\n        {                \n            MessageBox.Show(\"count &lt;= 0\");\n        }\n        if (currentIndex &lt;= (count - 1))  //in correct range\n        {\n            // BrowserHost does not remember previously added children elements added previously when navigated back to this page and performing this check\n            if(!BrowserHost.Children.Contains(Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser))\n                //Attempt to add browser if it was already added previously throws InvalidOperationException\n                BrowserHost.Children.Add(Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser);\n        }\n\n        if (currentIndex &gt; (count - 1))\n        {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"currentIndex &gt; (count - 1)\");\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; Settings.BrowserList.Value.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (Settings.BrowserList.Value.ElementAt(i) != null)\n            {\n                Settings.BrowserList.Value.ElementAt(i).Browser.Visibility = i == this.currentIndex ? Visibility.Visible : Visibility.Collapsed;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, the <code>ShowTab</code> method is called with a specific index value everytime the MainPage loads. A check is performed to see if <code>Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser</code> (a collection with web browser instances) exists at the currentIndex in the list (these are added in another page). If the <code>BrowserHost</code> grid on MainPage already contains the child element (a browser) with a particular index, then it should skip over the check and continue to show that browser instance on the screen. This is supposed to basically implement a tabbed browsing scenario for a custom web browser control I have created. My issue is, I can consecutively add new browsers to <code>BrowserHost</code> and show them on the screen, but when I try to call a previously added webbrowser at  certain index in my collection, I get an InvalidOperationException. How would I fix this? My debugging shows that in <code>ShowTab</code> when I check to see if a browser has been added, regardless of it has or not, it jumps into attempting to add that browser to <code>BrowserHost</code> child element. If the browser has been created previously, thats when the InvalidOperationException occurs.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","xaml","silverlight-toolkit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12570832,"title":"Ringtone selector in wp7","body":"<p>I am working on app where I need to create some alarms and reminder.

Its same screen as in native wp7 for ringtone selection with list of ringtone and play button to listen the ringtone.Is this any control of toolkit in wp7 like listpicker in which we can bind list of tones and play from there as well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","windows-phone-7","soap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":0,"question_id":6159083,"title":"app that get informations from web in windows phone 7","body":"<p>For my school project I need to make an app for Windows Phone 7 that give results scores and a range table of a famous football club.

I am trying to bind the <code>MapItemsControl</code> <code>ItemSource</code> to an <code>ObservableCollection</code> of <code>LocationDataSource</code>, which contain a property <code>MapPosition</code> of the type <code>GeoPoint</code>. <code>GeoPoint</code> is a simple class which contain information about the Latitude and Longitude of the location.\nThe locations which I populate into the <code>ObservableCollection</code> are fetched by a service which my <code>ViewModel</code> listens to and updates the collection when it has fetched the locations. Though it does not seem to work as no locations are shown on the map.\nTo bind the <code>GeoPoint</code>s I have made a converter which simply converts to <code>GeoCoordinate</code> which the <code>MapItemsControl</code> understands. I know the converter works as I am using it to bind to the <code>Map</code> <code>Center</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>The binding looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;maps:MapItemsControl x:Name=\"mapControl\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding Locations}\"&gt;\n    &lt;maps:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n            &lt;maps:Pushpin Location=\"{Binding MapPosition, Converter={StaticResource GeoPoint}}\" Template=\"{StaticResource pinSiteLoc}\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n    &lt;/maps:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/maps:MapItemsControl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The ViewModel looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private ObservableCollection&lt;LocationDataModel&gt; _locations;\npublic ObservableCollection&lt;LocationDataModel&gt; Locations\n{\n    get { return _locations; } \n    set\n    {\n        _locations = value;\n        FirePropertyChanged(() =&gt; Locations);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tried various ways to update the <code>Locations</code> collection, which is done in the <code>ViewModel</code> in an event handler after the <code>ViewModel</code> has loaded and is ready, I assumed this would be working:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Locations = LocationDataService.Locations;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have checked that <code>LocationDataService.Locations</code> is not empty and contains an actual location.\nI also tried intantiating the collection the the <code>ViewModel</code> constructor and then <code>add</code> each element to the collection, which did not show anything on the map either.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nAs per request in the comments.

My problem is that one of the lists contains a lot more movies than the others, about 100. When loading this list the app uses around 150-160 mb memory, which exceeds the limit of 90 mb.

However, the question it raises it not specific to ZeroMQ, but more generally regarding the need for a 'mapping' layer over the networking functionality provided in WinRT to provide a more normal 'Berkeley Socket facade' for C++ code when compiling against WinRT:</p>\n\n<p>Hi all, I've used ZeroMQ in a mobile app (see <a href=\"http://www.ibuzzedfirst.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ibuzzedfirst.com</a> ) previously, for the iPhone and Android versions, as those platforms support native/C++/Socket development, and therefore ZeroMQ.</p>\n\n<p>For the WindowsPhone 7.5 (OS 7.1) version, I had to re-implement any required ZeroMQ functionality from scratch, as WinPhone 7.5 only supports C#, not C++ (it's effectively a C# Silverlight App). Also, WinPhone 7.5 only provides its own 'version' of Socket support ( <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sb27wehh%28v=vs.95%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sb27wehh%28v=vs.95%29.aspx</a> ) which only support Async versions of functions, e.g. ConnectAsync, SendAync, ReceiveAsync etc. However, the lack of C++ made this a moot point.</p>\n\n<p>As such, for the WindowsPhone 7.5 version, I restricted the app to 'client' (Contestant) functionalty only, and didn't implement the 'server' (Quiz Master) part. This was because the client part of the app only sends and receives requests, replies and subscriptions to the server, whereas the server utilises the inherent multi-threaded multi-user functionality of ZeroMQ. It was (relatively) simple to recreate the ZeroMQ transport protocol/headers for client use, and use the WindowsPhone Socket support to provide comms.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, now I'm looking at porting the app to WinRT on Windows 8. (The desktop/tablet version first - the Windows Phone 8 RT SDK isn't out yet, but will be similar). The good news is that C++ is supported in WinRT, yay! (Actually, it still isn't that simple, when writing C# only WinRT apps, you can compile for 'AnyCPU', as soon as you include a C++ portion, you have to build 3 different versions - x86/Win32, x64, and ARM versions, but that's a different problem).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, like Windows 7/8 Phone, WinRT does NOT support 'normal' Berkeley Socket access, but instead offers its own 'version' of Socket programming, with discrete classes for different socket scenarios, e.g. StreamSocket for a connecting TCP client ( <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.sockets.streamsocket.aspx#methods\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.sockets.streamsocket.aspx#methods</a> ), StreamSocketListener for a bindable TCP server ( <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.sockets.streamsocketlistener.aspx#methods\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.sockets.streamsocketlistener.aspx#methods</a> ), and DatagramSocket / DatagramSocketListener for the UDP versions. Furthermore, only async versions of all the methods are provided.</p>\n\n<p>So it looks like, to get ZeroMQ to compile sucessfully on WinRT, I'm going to have to write a Facade layer that provdes a Berkeley Socket-like C++ interface, and underneath performs the necessary mapping to the version of Socket programming provided by WinRT.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else started this journey or written a similar facade? Interested to hear everyone's thoughts, especailly as WinRT looks to quite a 'big thing'!</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","gps"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":97,"score":0,"question_id":12456056,"title":"PositionChanged event in GeoCoordinateWatcher in WP7","body":"<p>I'm using GeoCoordinateWatcher to detect the logitude and latitude in windows phone 7 </p>\n\n<p>I did the following</p>\n\n<pre><code> GeoCoordinateWatcher watcher = new GeoCoordinateWatcher(GeoPositionAccuracy.Default);\n  // Add event handlers for StatusChanged and PositionChanged events\n        watcher.StatusChanged += new EventHandler&lt;GeoPositionStatusChangedEventArgs&gt;(watcher_StatusChanged);\n        watcher.PositionChanged += new EventHandler&lt;GeoPositionChangedEventArgs&lt;GeoCoordinate&gt;&gt;(watcher_PositionChanged);\n        watcher.MovementThreshold = 100;\n\n        // Create A Timer for Getting the GPS Cooradinate every 10 seconds only\n        System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer dt = new System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer();\n\n        // Start the Location service in the First time when the  Application run\n        StartLocationService();\n        // 15 minutes the interval of timer\n        dt.Interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 10, 0);\n\n        // Add the Tick Method for event Handler\n        dt.Tick += new EventHandler(Start_Service);\n\n        // Start the Timer\n        dt.Start();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in start_service method I'm calling watcher.start</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that watcher_PositionChanged is called every 10 seconds even if the location didn't change !!!\nand I knew that  </p>\n\n<pre><code>watcher.MovementThreshold = 100;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will watcher_PositionChanged  method be called when the traveled distance is 100 or more \nBut this didn't happen </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: I'm testing my code using emulator</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","reactiveui"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":83,"score":0,"question_id":12431271,"title":"ReactiveCollection and invalid cross-thread access","body":"<p>I'm developing my first app for Windows Phone 7.1 using Reactive UI, and I'm facing difficulties working with ReactiveCollection class.</p>\n\n<p>My app is roughly about accessing the WP7 SQL CE engine (LINQ to SQL).

But I don't think that technique could apply to the Windows Phone programming, since navigation between WP pages is very different from desktop stuff.

I was wondering if it was possible to only load specific data to a single view from the view model, because as it is right now my application is freezing because my view model attempts to load all the data even though only about half of it needs to be used on the current page the user is viewing. If so, I'm assuming I would somehow need to let the view model know which data to load. How would I accomplish this. OR, is it good practice to create two seperate view models, one for each page, so that only the necessary data for each page will load accordingly and keep my application from freezing?

Sorry\n  if my noobness scared you all away)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To get an animated Gif to work in your wp7 7.1 app, do these steps:</p>\n\n<p>1) Download ImageTools (I used latest version at the time (0.3)) <a href=\"http://imagetools.codeplex.com/downloads/get/156530\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imagetools.codeplex.com/downloads/get/156530</a></p>\n\n<p>2) Unstuff the file, and in the \"Bin > Phone\" folder just throw ALL* the dll file extensions into your wp7 app folder. The other files (xml/pdb) don't need to be added. (*this step is extra work, and we will be removing these extra dlls later on, but hell it'll save a headache.)</p>\n\n<p>3) Add the references to your wp7 app in the Solution Explorer window > References folder drop down. To do that, right click the References folder, click \"Add Reference\" and browse to the dll files. Repeat this process. (Referencing all those dlls is 1 minute of the extra 2 mins of work ultimately, but you shouldn't get any errors when compiling)</p>\n\n<p>4) Now on the xaml page you want to add the image to, add this at the top in your  header code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xmlns:it=\"clr-namespace:ImageTools.Controls;assembly=ImageTools.Controls\"\nxmlns:vm=\"clr-namespace:GifViewer.ViewModels\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NOTICE: Change \"GifViewer\" to your application name.</p>\n\n<p>5) On that same page, just below it, add in this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;phone:PhoneApplicationPage.DataContext&gt;\n    &lt;vm:MainViewModel/&gt;\n&lt;/phone:PhoneApplicationPage.DataContext&gt;\n\n&lt;Grid x:Name=\"LayoutRoot\" Background=\"Transparent\"&gt;\n    &lt;it:AnimatedImage  Source=\"{Binding AnimationImage}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NOTICE: Doesn't have to be a grid. Doesn't have to be in anything at all. It can stand alone.</p>\n\n<p>6) The accepted answer has a folder in the app called \"ViewModels\" and in it is a custom class titled \"MainViewModel\"  So in the solution explorer or in the desktop, add a folder called ViewModels and make a c# class page titled MainViewModel. Move that into that folder, and refresh the solution explorer. If you cannot see the file, you need to click the \"Show all files\" button just under the Solution Explorer Header.</p>\n\n<p>7) Using the accepted answer below, in the \"MainViewModel.cs\" class page, add the following just below the others:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using ImageTools;\nusing ImageTools.Controls; \nusing ImageTools.IO;\nusing ImageTools.IO.Gif;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>8) The accepted answer uses this code. Change \"GifViewer\" to your application name when copying this code, and also change the Uri location of the gif. In my example, I have a folder named \"Gif\" and in it is \"explosion.gif\". Build Action can be kept as Resource by default.</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace GifViewer.ViewModels {\n    public class MainViewModel : DependencyObject {\n        public MainViewModel() {\n            Decoders.AddDecoder&lt;GifDecoder&gt;();\n            Uri uri = new Uri(\"Gif/explosion.gif\", UriKind.Relative);\n            ExtendedImage image = new ExtendedImage();\n            // either of these two method work.\n            // Just remove the first / to switch\n            //*\n            image.LoadingCompleted +=\n                (o, e) =&gt; Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(() =&gt; AnimationImage = image);\n            image.UriSource = uri;\n            /*/\n            Stream stream = Application.GetResourceStream(uri).Stream;\n            GifDecoder decoder = new GifDecoder();\n            decoder.Decode(image, stream);\n            AnimationImage = image;\n            /**/\n        }\n\n        public static readonly DependencyProperty AnimationImageProperty =\n            DependencyProperty.Register(\"AnimationImage\",\n                typeof(ExtendedImage),\n                typeof(MainViewModel),\n                new PropertyMetadata(default(ExtendedImage)));\n\n        public ExtendedImage AnimationImage {\n            get { return (ExtendedImage)GetValue(AnimationImageProperty); }\n            set { SetValue(AnimationImageProperty, value); }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Go ahead and compile. You might get a runtime error indicating that  \ncouldn't load, but running the application should get rid of it.</p>\n\n<p>Your gif should now play.</p>\n\n<p>9) Start removing the EXTRA dll references which aren't needed (the other minute of the 2 mins of extra work). Basically, all you want referenced is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ImageTools\nImageTools.Controls\nImageRools.IO.Gif \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ImageTools.Controls might not even be needed, but the file size is like 25kb and honestly I couldn't get the gif to show if I removed it. </p>\n\n<p>There you go!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Original Question I asked</h2>\n\n<p>I am having the worst headache trying to get my animated gif to play in my WP7 app. I simply cannot connect the dots to make this happen, despite having imagetools and viewing the current \"solutions\" on stackoverflow/the web. </p>\n\n<p>My problem is outlined below, but for reference I have looked at: \n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4152564/display-gif-in-a-wp7-application-with-silverlight\">Display GIF in a WP7 application with Silverlight</a>\nand <a href=\"http://blog.naviso.fr/wordpress/?p=733\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.naviso.fr/wordpress/?p=733</a></p>\n\n<p>So how does one actually set this blasted thing up to display animated gifs in a wp7 app!?

Why would it be a bad thing to create the DBs and introduce the DB context, but not insert any data? </p>\n\n<p>Here's my LINQ DB model: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kypeli/Podcatcher/blob/master/wp7/Podcatcher/ViewModels/PodcastSubscriptionModel.cs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kypeli/Podcatcher/blob/master/wp7/Podcatcher/ViewModels/PodcastSubscriptionModel.cs</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's where I get the exception on second start if I didn't insert any data on the first launch: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kypeli/Podcatcher/blob/master/wp7/Podcatcher/PodcastSqlModel.cs#L64\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kypeli/Podcatcher/blob/master/wp7/Podcatcher/PodcastSqlModel.cs#L64</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It also strikes me that there's no API call to check if a table exists or not in LINQ, so I would have to assume \"this should just work\" - but it doesn't. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? Thanks! :) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I verified analyzing the .sdf file that indeed there are no tables created if I don't insert any data upon first launch of the app. As I see it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>This is a bug in LINQ-to-SQL</strong>. It should not crash if there are no tables present, but know that it should create them. Or deal with the case and create tables only when data is inserted. </li>\n<li>I would need to insert some dummy data into SQL always on first launch, or...</li>\n<li>Check if a table exists, if not, react to it by forcing LINQ-to-SQL to create them. But how? </li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","sdk","expression-blend"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12369980,"title":"Expression Blend doesn't load project","body":"<p>Suddenly my Expression Blend won't work anymore.

<code>x:Name=\"grdPreview\"</code>. These are the last two items in the above code. The animations work correctly, but as of now the toggle button is located on the top of <code>grdPreview</code> which makes absolutely no sense for the user and also looks terrible. I feel like I've tried everything to relocate this toggle button to the center and right side of <code>grdPreview</code> but nothing has worked. Any ideas!?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","windows-phone-7.1","dropbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":383,"score":0,"question_id":8540717,"title":"What would be the logic behind a Dropbox Syncing Note Taking Application?","body":"<p>Can anyone please suggest some logic behind a an application that syncs notes with one's DropBox Account? </p>\n\n<p>Consider me a newb. </p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking it should somewhere be around these lines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The app takes notes.</li>\n<li>The user has to input in his dropbox credentials.</li>\n<li>Everytime a new note is created, it MUST be synced to his dropbox account.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What would be the various APIs that are to be implemented?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","windows-phone-7.1"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":104,"score":0,"question_id":8596710,"title":"How to load a new image on the Image Control each time the Button Control is pressed?","body":"<p>As the topic, how do I keep load a new image (from a set of images already onto the app) each time the Button Contro is pressed?

I think it had to do with adding another definition, but the details are murky.   What is clear though, is that the code is broken now.   On the C# side, here's the start of page.xaml.cs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage\n{\n    private ObservableCollection&lt;Route&gt; displayRoutes = new ObservableCollection&lt;Route&gt;();\n    private DispatcherTimer refresher = null;\n\n    public MainPage()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        DepartureTime.Style = tooLateStyle;\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's a screenshot from the debugger when I break just after this line: <a href=\"http://sdrv.ms/TlL3os\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sdrv.ms/TlL3os</a>  (Sorry I couldn't upload---I don't have enough reputation juice yet).   Note the 'x's on members that aren't initialized --- they are all defined in the same place, using the same coding style as the ones with green checks that are initialized.  In the locals window I can verify that <code>this.Resources[\"tooLateStyle\"]</code> returns a correct value but <code>this.FindName(\"tooLateStyle\")</code> does not. But they both return a value for <code>goodStyle</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've done a bunch of permutations of this code trying to see if there were issues with using x:Key vs. x:Name, with the names themselves, with the ordering of the definitions, with cross-referencing between them, etc.   The only interesting thing I've found is that the actual member fields are also generated inconsistently.  (In the screenshot, you'll note that there were no members generated for the brushes --- but when I delete a few Style definitions, suddenly there are members generated for brushes.)   That is disturbing on it's own, but I'll settle for solving one problem at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Normally when it seems like gremlins are at work, I vote strongly for user error.   But I'm scratching my head on this one.

exception when binding PivotItem header","body":"<p>I've noticed a strange exception in my Windows Phone 7.1 application that really made me crazy.</p>\n\n<p>These are the facts...</p>\n\n<p>I start defining a simple <code>Pivot</code> item with two simple <code>PivotItem</code> inside:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentPanel\" Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"12,0,12,0\"&gt;\n    &lt;controls:Pivot&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem x:Name=\"PivotItem1\"\n                            Header=\"Test1\" /&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem x:Name=\"PivotItem2\"\n

my code-behind...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As Gambit suggested me, I will show you more code.</p>\n\n<p>In the real situation, <strong>I DO HAVE</strong> A MVVM, but in this case I simplified the situation to let you reproduce the problem in an easy way...</p>\n\n<p>For this test the next is my View:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage, INotifyPropertyChanged\n{\n    private string _text2 = \"&lt;Missing&gt;\";\n\n    public string Text2\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _text2;\n        }\n        private set\n        {\n            _text2 = value;\n\n            NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Text2\");\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    public MainPage()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        this.DataContext = this;\n    }\n\n\n    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\n\n    public void

Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        this.Text2 = \"Second page\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it's not just the parameter initialization of a <code>NULL</code> value: you will see the exception.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, you are asking me for the <code>controls</code> namespace declaration. This is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xmlns:controls=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Controls;assembly=Microsoft.Phone.Controls\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This refers to the assembly <code>Microsoft.Phone.Controls.dll</code>, version <strong>2.0.50727</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is related to the binding (as I discovered investigating the problem):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Header=\"{Binding Path=Text2, Mode=OneWay}\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you do not use bindings linked to the <code>Header</code> property of the <code>PivotItem</code>, everything works well, otherwise...the app will throw an exception, completely silent, and it won't show up in any case (you can see the exception only in the Output Window):</p>\n\n<pre><code>A first chance exception of type 'System.Exception' occurred in System.Windows.dll\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you assign the <code>Header</code> property manually, no exceptions will be thrown.</p>\n\n<p>I want to completely remove this exceptions, because I have a lot of bindings to the Header property, I don't want to break my MVVM...and it's also very annoying!</p>\n\n<p>I really hate to see unmanaged exceptions...</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know about this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Any solution/workaround?</p>\n\n<p>Any help will be very appreciated...thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","xaml","usercontrols"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":183,"score":1,"question_id":11814466,"title":"Why my user control crashes Visual Studio?","body":"<p>I've spent all day trying to figure out why this user control crashes VS2010 (Windows Phone 7.1 development).

The repositories have a reference to the Context class that is created inside the ViewModel class and, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AccountRepository\n{\n    private MyContext _context;\n\n    public AccountRepository(ref MyContext context)\n    {\n        _context = context;\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Account&gt; GetAll()\n    {\n        return new ObservableCollection(_context.Accounts.Where([some paramethers]).AsEnumerable());\n\n\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My ViewModel initialize the repositories in the constructor and then expose methods with some few logic code to insert, delete, etc, each of this types.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyPropertyChanging\n{\n    private MyContext _context;\n    private AccountRepository accountRepository;\n    private TransactionRepository transactionRepository;\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Account&gt; AllAccounts;\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Transaction&gt; AllTransactions;\n\n    public MyViewModel(string connectionString)\n    {\n        _context = new MyContext(\"Data Source=’isostore:/mydatabase.sdf’\"); if (!db.DatabaseExists()) db.CreateDatabase();\n\n        accountRepository = new AccountRepository(ref _context);\n        transactionRepository = new TransactionRepository(ref _context);\n\n        // [Some other code]\n\n        LoadCollections();           \n    }\n\n    // {...}\n\n    public void LoadCollections()\n    {\n        AllAccounts = accountRepository.GetAll();\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"AllAccounts\");\n        AllTransactions = transactionRepository.GetAll();\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"AllTransactions\");\n    }\n\n    public void InsertTransaction(Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        AllTransactions.Add(transaction);\n        transactionRepository.Add(transaction);\n\n        LoadCollections(); // Tried this to update the Accounts with newer values, but don't work...\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user create a Transaction, the page calls the InsertTransaction(Transaction transaction) method in the view model, that pass the transaction object to the repository. But the Transactions collection in the Account object doesn't get updated. Then I tried to call the LoadCollections() method to force a new query in the context, and try to somehow get a fresh account object, but it still without the recently created transaction. If I stop my app and start it again, the Accounts are up to date and have all transactions I've created in the last run whitin its transactions collection.</p>\n\n<p>How can I update this Transactions collection at runtime?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updating the question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I had some feedback regarding to notifying the UI that the collection was changed. Maybe I was not very clear in my explanation, I'm sorry, english isn't my first language so there's a chance what I wrote isn't necessarily what I wanted to say.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's a problem with the association between transactions and account. Once I create a transaction, it won't appear in it's account.Transactions collection until I dispose my context and create it again.</p>\n\n<p>It may be some notify fault, but I DON'T think it is and I did some code to try to prove it, I'm not in my PC right now but I'll try to explain my test.</p>\n\n<p>The code I did to prove it was something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Account c1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\nTransaction t1 = new Transaction() { Account = c1, {...} };\n\ncontext.Transactions.InsertOnSubmit(t1);\ncontext.SaveChanges();\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS NOT in the c1.Transactions collection right NOW.\n\ncontext.Dispose();\n\ncontext = new MyContext({...});\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS in the c1.Transactions after the dispose!\n\nAccount c2 = context.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\nt1 = context.Transactions.Where(t =&gt; t.TransactionID == x).SingleOrDefault();\n\nt1.Account = c2;\n\ncontext.SubmitChanges();\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction still in the c1 collection!!!\n\nc2 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// It should be in the c2 collection, but isn't yet...\n\ncontext.Dispose();\n\ncontext = new MyContext({...});\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction is not in the c1.Transaction anymore!\n\nc2 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS in the c2.Transactions now!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've updated the code with the call of NotifyPropertyChanged in my view model, thanks saus for remembering me, but it still won't work. :(</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added some test code trying to find where the error may be.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","windows-phone-7","install"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12182120,"title":"Error while installing Windows Phone SDK","body":"<p>while i am installing windows phone 7 SDK following error is occured and setup can not complete.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uay5k.png\" alt=\"errow when installing Windows Phone SDK 7.1\"></p>\n\n<p>Any one know how to resolve this error and install Windows Phone 7 SDK.</p>\n\n<p>i already installed Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate but still installation error is coming</p>\n\n<p>Thanks In Advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","facebook-c#-sdk"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":163,"score":0,"question_id":11041254,"title":"How to line break in Facebook C# SDK Post?","body":"<p>I have been messing with the Facebook C# SDK using WP7 and managed to post to my wall.

This page contains a OnNavigateTo method, for bringing the elements from the main page and displaying it, And i wrote my codings in this method to add dynamically children to the stackpanel. when navigating back from the second page to the first page, the compiler will goes to the OnNavigateTo method and regenerate the children of the stackpanel once again.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is:</p>\n\n<p>i want to show the previously displayed first page with all the data, when  the back button is pressed. I doesn't want the page to regenerate again. I want the static page which i have previously when i go back from the second page to the first page.</p>\n\n<p>How to do it? please help me with some piece of code... Thank You..</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","windows-phone-7","xaml","richtextbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":12098250,"title":"Display curly braces in RichTextBox when manually setting Xaml property","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a Twitter app for Windows Phone, in which – via a custom <code>DependencyProperty</code> – the <code>Xaml</code> property of each <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.richtextbox%28v=vs.95%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>RichTextBox</code></a> is bound to the text of a tweet (which includes programmatically generated <code>Run</code> elements with all the text). This works good enough until there are curly braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> in the text. I tried replacing them with <code>&amp;#123;</code> and escaping with <code>{}</code> but to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>The weird thing is, if the curly braces show up in the middle of the text (more specifically, in the <code>Text</code> property of a <code>Run</code> element) everything's fine, it's only when an opening curly brace is at the beginning* <em>or</em> a closing curly brace is at the end* that the <code>RichTextBox</code> crashes. I was able to work around this by inserting zero-width spaces with <code>&amp;#8203;</code> at the beginning and end of each <code>Run</code>.</p>\n\n<p>However, this issue gets more complicated if there is both an opening curly brace at the beginning* <em>and</em> a closing curly brace at the end*.

Think about a \"blast radius\" or \"sphere of influence\" kind of thing. I'll need at least two dozen of these circles on the map, together with some other polygons, so making sure performance does not suffer and the maps continues to be easily manipulative seems key here.</p>\n\n<p>So far I can think of three options (of which I tried two):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Add n-sided <code>MapPolygon</code> instances to the map for each circle. Tried this, and works fine in principle. However, the number of vertices per polygon is a bit of pickle. Too little, and when you zoom in it looks hideous. Too many, and performance will start to suffer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add <code>Pushpin</code> instances for each circle, and style/template them as circle that are centered around the pushpin location. Seems to work, except that the size of the cicle is then fixed in screen size, not map size. So when you zoom, the circles stay the same size on screen, while they should zoom with the map. <em>Can you bind the size of <code>Ellipse</code> control (in the template in the style I use) to the <code>Zoom</code> of the parent map control in some way..?</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Create a custom subclass of <code>MapShapeBase</code> to represent each circle. This implementation could dynamically change the number of vertices used to draw the polygon depending on whether the shape is visible on the map or not (=inside current view port) and what the zoom level is. That is, if map shapes have access to this information. I haven't tried this option yet.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What have you used? What would you use? How would you work around the problems mentioned above, <em>especially binding a property of a control in a template used in a style to a parent control property using XAML</em>?

The issue I am having is how to update the BackgroundImage of the secondary tile when the user selects a new image in the application. As far as I can tell, the best way to update the BackgroundImage so the user always sees the new image he or she has chosen, is to update the secondary tile in the OnNavigatedFrom event on my MainPage. I am not sure how to udpate a secondary tile though that is not created in a click event.</p>\n\n<p>To add a little bit more detail, my application has a hubtile, and I have created a ContextMenu with a 'pin to start' option and a 'change image' option. The 'change image' option loads the PhotoChooserTask and allows the user to pick an image from there and then saves that image in isolated storage and applies it to the hubtile. When the user clicks 'pin to start', a secondary tile is created which has the same image as its respective hubtile. So far this works, but when I change the image in the application's hubtile, I do not know how to automatically update the respective secondary tile's image on the start screen. Every method I have researched online shows how to update a tile instance in the same click event as where the tile is created (perhaps in a button click event saying 'create tile'), but how would I get an instance of this tile to update in another method or event handler, such as the OnNavigatedFrom event?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","mediaplayer","radio","spotify"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":125,"score":3,"question_id":11879231,"title":"Resuming spotify/radio after MediaPlayerLauncher's media is finished - WP7","body":"<p>This question is related to another question i have asked:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11864557/mediaplayerlauncher-on-wp7-how-to-resume-previously-playing-media/11865530#11865530\">MediaPlayerLauncher on WP7 - how to resume previously playing media?</a></p>\n\n<p>Quick overview: Users can view movietrailers in my WP7-app, using <code>MediaPlayerLauncher</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I am able to resume \"normal music\" when my trailer is done, like you can see on my other asked question.

And hence it is clear that the session is not maintained and the server is sending some anonymous data.</p>\n\n<p>Some one help me on how to maintain the session in the SOAP client.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I cannot ask the web service providers on this. :(</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12057839,"title":"Browser back and forward button","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12053067/browser-back-and-forward-button-in-windows-phone\">Browser back and forward button in windows phone</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I am completely new to Windows Phone programming and I am trying to make a small browser.

Made an edit to see if that bumps it, but that did not seem to work. So here is the last try to the question</p>\n\n<p>I can't seem to figure out how one can get the value of a specific textblock in a listbox. To start things off, here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ListBox HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Name=\"listItems\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" &gt;\n   &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n      &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n         &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\" Height=\"210\" &gt;\n            &lt;Grid Height=\"210\" Background=\"#75FFF8DC\"&gt;\n\n               &lt;toolkit:GestureService.GestureListener&gt;\n                  &lt;toolkit:GestureListener Tap=\"GestureListener_Tap\"\n                     DoubleTap=\"GestureListener_DoubleTap\"\n                     Hold=\"GestureListener_Hold\"\n                     Flick=\"GestureListener_Flick\"/&gt;\n               &lt;/toolkit:GestureService.GestureListener&gt; \n\n                     ...CODE... \n&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code area contains a bunch of other grids, partitions (columns and rows) and textblocks. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Image Name=\"XXX\" Source=\"{Binding XXXPath}\" Stretch=\"Fill\" \n   Grid.Column=\"0\"/&gt;\n&lt;TextBlock Name=\"YYY\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Grid.Row=\"0\"  \n   Text=\"{Binding YYYPath}\" Foreground=\"Black\"/&gt;\n&lt;TextBlock Name=\"ZZZ\" Grid.Column=\"2\" Grid.Row=\"0\"  \n   Text=\"{Binding ZZZPath}\" Foreground=\"Black\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what I want, is if someone taps the grid (that means anything in the grid, including these textblocks and images), I want to first get the text of the textblock \"YYY.\" </p>\n\n<p>I could have inserted that code into a textblock and used sender as textblock, but I do not want to limit my gestures to one textblock, nor do I want to repeat that for each element in the grid (lots of issues and seems unnecessary).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: If this does not work, I can also implement just one tap gesture (but again, for the whole grid) and use that to get the value of the textblock. Is there no way? Otherwise I will have to do this: Add tap for the textblock and use sender as a textblock, then get the value of the text. But I really do <strong>not</strong> want to use this approach.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","xml","silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":0,"question_id":12048575,"title":"Listbox

As well, if I let it continue on long enough, I get a OutOfMemoryException, even though the image I'm calling in is about a KB in size, and the .map file would create only a 3x3 matrix.</p>\n\n<p>GameplayScreen.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private Level level;\n    ...\n    public override void LoadContent()\n    {\n        if (Content == null)\n            Content = new ContentManager(ScreenManager.Game.Services, \"Content\");\n        //Create Sprite Batch for drawing textures\n        //spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n\n        //Load fonts\n        hudFont = Content.Load&lt;SpriteFont&gt;(\"Fonts/hud\");\n\n        lifeIcon = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(\"Sprites/Player/lifeIco\");\n\n        //Load overlays\n        //winOverlay = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(\"Overlays/win\");\n        //loseOverlay = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(\"Overlays/lose\");\n\n        try\n        {\n            MediaPlayer.IsRepeating = true;\n            MediaPlayer.Play(Content.Load&lt;Song&gt;(\"Sounds/music\"));\n        }\n        catch { }\n\n        LoadNextLevel();\n\n        //Camera.InitializeScreen(graphics);\n\n        base.LoadContent();\n    } //end LoadContent\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Loads the next level.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    public void LoadNextLevel()\n    {\n        //Set the next level\n        levelIndex = (levelIndex + 1) % numberOfLevels;\n\n        if (level != null)\n            level.Dispose();\n\n        level = new Level(ScreenManager.Game.Services, levelIndex);\n\n    } //end LoadNextLevel()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Level.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private TileMap levelMap;\n    public Level(IServiceProvider service, int levelIndex)\n    {\n        //Create content manager for current level.\n        content = new ContentManager(service, \"Content\");\n\n        //Load level map\n        //This is where the code hangs\n        levelMap = new TileMap(this, levelIndex, content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(@\"Tiles/tiles\"));\n\n\n        //Load sounds\n        //exampleSound = content.Load&lt;SoundEffect&gt;(\"Sounds/example\");\n\n        //Initialize Camera\n        Camera.InitializeLevel(levelMap);\n        player = new Player(this, start);\n    } //end Level\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>TileMap.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public TileMap(Level level, int levelIndex, Texture2D tileSheet)\n    {\n        // Never reaches here on Windows Phone 7 Version\n        // Comes right here on Windows and Xbox 360 Version\n        this.tileSheet = tileSheet;\n\n        string levelPath = string.Format(\"Content/Levels/{0}.map\", levelIndex);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A few things I have already been suggest and tried to do:</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to call \"Tiles/tiles\" outside of the call to Tile Map and I have tried to compress tiles with DXT compression.

I didn't see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10187829/wp7-listpicker-not-showing-all-items\">this one</a> until after I posted.</p>\n\n<p>I have a ListPicker control (most recent version of Toolkit) in a WP7.5 app whose ItemSource is set to a <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> object. The list object is created by querying a table in a SQLite database; records are iterated and added to the <code>List&lt;&gt;</code>. In this case, the items are categories.</p>\n\n<p>The ListPicker is set to multiselect mode and opens fullscreen. I have other ListPicker controls on the page that are doing the exact same thing with other recordsets with no problem. The problem with this one ListPicker is that there's a single item that doesn't display. The fullscreen list has the spacing for it, so it's not collapsed, but it's not visible.</p>\n\n<p>I thought maybe it was a data issue, but the routine that returns the <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> object is used elsewhere with no problems.</p>\n\n<p>By one item, I mean of the 18 records, one of them just doesn't display. Initially, it was the last item in the list (as determined by the ORDER BY clause). I added another item to the database, and that item displays fine, leaving a blank space for the missing item right above it. I changed the display order of the items in the database, and the list item not displaying is still the second to last in the list, now a different item altogether than before.</p>\n\n<p>The ListPicker is actually an inherited control, so that I can access the <code>SelectedItemsProperty</code> dependency property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ListPicker : Microsoft.Phone.Controls.ListPicker {\n    public new IList SelectedItems {\n        get { return ( IList )GetValue( SelectedItemsProperty ); }\n        set { SetValue( SelectedItemsProperty, value ); }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All of the ListPickers in the app use this. The XAML is thus:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;local:ListPicker x:Name=\"Categories\" SelectionMode=\"Multiple\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the C#, where <code>GetCategories</code> returns a <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> of Category objects:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.Categories.ItemsSource = Category.GetCategories();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>Category</code> is defined as</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Category() {\n    public Category() {\n        this.Display = 0;\n        this.ID = -1;\n        this.Name = string.Empty;\n    }\n\n    public int Display { get; set; }\n\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    public override ToString() {\n        return this.Name;\n    }\n\n    public static List&lt;Category&gt; GetCategories() {\n       // code uses ADO.NET (not Linq) to read and iterate recordset\n       // populated into List&lt;&gt; object\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've verified the data and it's both valid and correct.

Unfortunately, it doesn't support fuzzy property/field names like RestSharp (or I haven't found any), so it also doesn't map correctly to my CLR entities when I use something like say <code>JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;User&gt;(response.Content)</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Here's what my Json looks like (an example actually):</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"id\" : 77239923,\n    \"username\" : \"UzEE\",\n    \"email\" : \"uzee@email.net\",\n    \"name\" : \"Uzair Sajid\",\n    \"twitter_screen_name\" : \"UzEE\",\n    \"join_date\" : \"2012-08-13T05:30:23Z05+00\",\n    \"timezone\" : 5.5,\n    \"access_token\" : {\n        \"token\" : \"nkjanIUI8983nkSj)*#)(kjb@K\",\n        \"scope\" : [ \"read\", \"write\", \"bake pies\" ],\n        \"expires\" : 57723\n    },\n    \"friends\" : [{\n        \"id\" : 2347484\",\n        \"name\" : \"Bruce Wayne\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\" : 996236,\n        \"name\" : \"Clark Kent\"\n    }]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's an example of my CLR entities:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class AccessToken \n{\n    public string Token { get; set; }\n    public int Expires { get; set; }\n    public string[] Scope { get; set; }\n    public string Secret { get; set; } /* may not always be returned */\n}\n\nclass User\n{\n    public ulong Id { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string Email { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public string TwitterScreenName { get; set; }\n    public DateTime JoinDate { get; set; }\n    public float Timezone { get; set; }\n    public bool IsOnline { get; set; } /* another field that might be blank e.g. */\n\n    public AccessToken AccessToken { get; set; }\n\n    public List&lt;User&gt; Friends { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I want is a simple way to parse the above JSON into the given CLR objects. I've looked around the RestSharp source code and have seen the <code>JsonDeserializer</code> code and I've been able to write a generic extension method <code>DeserializeResponse&lt;T&gt;</code> on <code>JObject</code> that should return a an object of type <code>T</code>. The intended use is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var user = JObject.Parse(response.Content).DeserializeResponse&lt;User&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above method should parse the given Json Response to a User entity object. Here's an actual code snippet of what I'm doing in the <code>DeserializeResponse&lt;User&gt;</code> extension method (its based on RestSharp code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static T DeserializeResponse&lt;T&gt;(this JObject obj) where T : new()\n{\n    T result = new T();\n    var props = typeof(T).GetProperties().Where(p =&gt; p.CanWrite).ToList();\n    var objectDictionary = obj as IDictionary&lt;string, JToken&gt;;\n\n    foreach (var prop in props)\n    {\n        var name = prop.Name.GetNameVariants(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture).FirstOrDefault(n =&gt; objectDictionary.ContainsKey(n));\n        var value = name != null ? obj[name] : null;\n\n        if (value == null) continue;\n\n        var type = prop.PropertyType;\n\n        if (type.IsGenericType &amp;&amp; type.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Nullable&lt;&gt;))\n        {\n            type = type.GetGenericArguments()[0];\n        }\n\n        // This is a problem.

Will I have to use an <code>AudioStreamingAgent</code> instead? Is there any open source examples as to how I implement this mysterious <code>MediaStreamSource</code> class? Should I scrap my great idea?

When I make the call to fetch the data, I don't get any errors from the application, and the data in the UI does not refresh.

Thanks in advance!</p>\n\n<p>I initialize my objects (rectangles) in a grid as such:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentPanel\" Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"12,0,12,0\"&gt;\n   &lt;Rectangle Name=\"rec1\" Height=\"80\" Width=\"10\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Right\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Margin=\"0,30,140,0\"&gt;\n      &lt;Rectangle.RenderTransform&gt;\n         &lt;RotateTransform x:Name=\"rec1Transform\" Angle=\"0\" CenterX=\"5\" CenterY=\"-10\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/Rectangle.RenderTransform&gt;\n   &lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n   &lt;Rectangle Name=\"rec2\" Height=\"10\" Width=\"80\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Right\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Margin=\"0,15,55,0\"&gt;\n   .\n   .\n   .\n   &lt;/Rectangle&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this moment, I have 4 general storyboards that I want to use many times over, and I am using a series of buttons to imitate all of the animations.  For example:</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Storyboards</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>private void rotate1(object parameter, object secondParameter, String Target)\n{\n\n   oneTwo.Stop();\n   oneTwo.Children[0].SetValue(Storyboard.TargetNameProperty, Target);\n   oneTwo.Begin();\n}\n\nprivate void rotate2(object parameter, object secondParameter, String Target)\n{\n   twoThree.Stop();\n   twoThree.Children[0].SetValue(Storyboard.TargetNameProperty, Target);\n   twoThree.Begin();\n}\n\nprivate void rotate1Inverse(object parameter, object secondParameter, string Target)\n{\n   twoOne.Stop();\n   twoOne.Children[0].SetValue(Storyboard.TargetNameProperty, Target);\n   twoOne.Begin();\n}\n\nprivate void rotate2Inverse(object parameter, object secondParameter, string Target)\n{\n   threeTwo.Stop();\n   threeTwo.Children[0].SetValue(Storyboard.TargetNameProperty, Target.ToString());\n   threeTwo.Begin();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>My Simulation Buttons</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>//Rotate Buttons\nprivate void button_Click1(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec1Transform.CenterY = -10;\n\n    rotate2(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec1Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click2(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec2Transform.CenterX = -10;\n\n    rotate1(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec2Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click3(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec3Transform.CenterY = -10;\n\n    rotate1(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec3Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click4(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec4Transform.CenterX = -10;\n\n    rotate2(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec4Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click5(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec5Transform.CenterY = -10;\n\n    rotate2(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec5Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click6(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec6Transform.CenterX = -10;\n\n    rotate2(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec6Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click7(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec7Transform.CenterY = -10;\n\n    rotate1(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec7Transform\");\n}\n\n//Inverse Rotate Buttons\nprivate void button_Click1_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec1Transform.CenterY = 90;\n\n    rotate1Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec1Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click2_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec2Transform.CenterX = 90;\n\n    rotate2Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec2Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click3_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec3Transform.CenterY = 90;\n\n    rotate2Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec3Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click4_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec4Transform.CenterX = 90;\n\n    rotate1Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec4Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click5_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec5Transform.CenterY = 90;\n\n    rotate1Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec5Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click6_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec6Transform.CenterX = 90;\n\n    rotate1Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec6Transform\");\n}\n\nprivate void button_Click7_Inverse(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    rec7Transform.CenterY = 90;\n\n    rotate2Inverse(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, PlaneProjection.RotationZProperty, \"rec7Transform\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that I want to use these 4 basic storyboards SIMULTANEOUSLY on as many as 20 rectangles at a time, thereby animating all 20 rectangles in unison.  But I don't want a static storyboard assigned to each rectangle, because the storyboard I want to apply to each rectangle changes every second or so.  I will also be using all 4 storyboards at the same time. (i.e. I will use \"oneTwo\" for 3 of the rectangles, \"twoThree\" for 5 of the rectangles, \"twoOne\" for 8 of the rectangles, and \"threeTwo\" for 2 of the rectangles)</p>\n\n<p>I hope that all makes sense.  The program is based solely on animating many rectangles at the same time, and any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":143,"score":0,"question_id":10844392,"title":"Border for WebBrowser control","body":"<p>First i have created a web browser control(full screen sized) and then i have created a border above the web browser control but when i debugged it, the border is not visible.

Click the button and use <code>NavigateService.Navigate(page2Uri)</code> and navigate to page2.</p>\n\n<p>Page 2 makes query and downloads images from internet, so in its <code>OnNavigateTo</code> handler, I check the page back stack, if it is navigated from page 1, I will do the download. In the app bar of this page, I have a button that can navigate to page3.</p>\n\n<p>Page 3 is a list of options that will perform some behavior on the image that is downloaded in page2. Once I choose an option, I want to go back to page 2 and perform some behavior on the loaded image.<br>Here the question comes: <br>if I use <code>NavigateService.Navigate(page2Uri)</code> to navigate from page3 to page2, it will call the Page2 constructor and <code>OnNavigateTo</code> handler again, which will cause it to lose every instance variable it already got.\n<br>But if I use <code>NavigatService.GoBack</code> it will go back to page2, then realizes that the backstack top entry is page1 (since page1 -> page2 -> page3).
