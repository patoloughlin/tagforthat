Is there anyone who tell me the complete procedure to integrate the plugins? And also how to add plugin entry in the WMAppManifest.xml file?\nThanks in advance....</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13103102,"title":"Test Windows phone apps without paying for dev center account?","body":"<p>It appears Microsoft would like £65 before I can test an app on my own phone.

Here's the method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnNavigatedTo(System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs e)\n{\n    base.OnNavigatedTo(e);\n    this.DataContext = null;\n    this.DataContext = Settings.NotesList;\n    Settings.CurrentNoteIndex = -1;\n    TheListBox.SelectedIndex = -1;\n    if (Settings.NotesList.Count &lt;= 0) // EXCEPTION\n    {\n        NoteStatus.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;\n        TheListBox.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        NoteStatus.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed;\n        TheListBox.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where in a separate file I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class Settings\n{\n    static Settings() { }\n    public static ObservableCollection&lt;Note&gt; NotesList;\n    static IsolatedStorageSettings settings;\n    private static int currentNoteIndex;\n    public static int CurrentNoteIndex { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wanted to test the program before writing any more but I'm not sure what's causing this. The OnNavigatedTo is from launching the application so I never even get to MainPage.xaml. Help is very appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","qt","windows-phone-7","bluetooth","symbian"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13093367,"title":"Symbian Windows Phone bluetooth communication","body":"<p>If wanted to communicate bluetooth messages between Symbian and Windows Phone using Qt and C# respectively,how would I go about it?

I was assuming that long polling would be able to keep connections open much longer?</li>\n<li>SignalR doesn't use Websockets, which is enabled on the server and does work with another library (Websockets4Net). The client does submit the TryWebSockets parameter with true.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm especially curious about issue 1 and 2, as I'm worried that this behavior would give a heavy load on the server.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I have now also tried connecting to the same SignalR server using the JavaScript implementation. This actually does use Websockets. When I disable Websockets the long polling works perfectly, keeping the connection open for a long time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":13063846,"title":"listbox performance in WP7","body":"<p>I have a Itemscontrol nested within a listbox.DataTemplate consits of image and border controls.The listbox scrolling is pretty slow.How can i improve its performance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","windows-phone-7.1"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13068228,"title":"WP7 Reminder with NavigationUri when phone is blocked issue","body":"<p>When <code>Reminder</code> created with set path in <code>NavigationUri</code> param have such issue:\nwhen phone is blocked (under locked screen) and reminder shown, it's impossible to navigate to the app using Tap on title or content of the reminder message.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to solve such problem, or it's ussual behaviour for reminder and lock screen?</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","xaml","windows-phone-7.1"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13064355,"title":"DataTemplate in pivotItems wp7","body":"<p>I would like to create a pivotpage in wp7:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;Grid x:Name=\"LayoutRoot\" Background=\"Transparent\"&gt;\n    &lt;!--Pivot Control--&gt;\n    &lt;controls:Pivot Title=\"MY APPLICATION\"&gt;\n        &lt;!--Pivot item one--&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem Header=\"item1\"&gt;\n            &lt;Grid/&gt;\n        &lt;/controls:PivotItem&gt;\n\n        &lt;!--Pivot item two--&gt;\n        &lt;controls:PivotItem Header=\"item2\"&gt;\n            &lt;Grid/&gt;\n        &lt;/controls:PivotItem&gt;\n    &lt;/controls:Pivot&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need that the pivoItems will be binded automatically with my  <code>List&lt;Article&gt;</code> and class Article are defined like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class Article\n{\n    private string _logoUrl;\n    public string LogoUrl\n    {\n        get { return _logoUrl; }\n        set { _logoUrl = value; }\n    }\n    private string _title;\n    public string Title\n    {\n        get { return _title; }\n        set { _title = value; }\n    }\n    private string _descrption;\n    public string Descrption\n    {\n        get { return _descrption; }\n        set { _descrption = value; }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I use Datatemplate to bind each PivotItem with each Article (I need that the title of each Article will be showd in the header of PivotItem and the description in webbrowser because it's a HTML)</p>\n\n<p>Best regards </p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2655,"score":0,"question_id":4344952,"title":"Looking for a DataGrid Control","body":"<p>I have been trying to find both built-in datagrid control and third party datagrid control for windows phone 7 but with no luck.

Can you do interactivity in Expression blend at all?</p>\n\n<p>From what I can gather (again I'm not sure about this), one works with both these applications. Expression Blend for the UI, and Visual Studio for the back-end/interactivity. Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the above is correct. How do you go about this?

I am loading all the details in one shot and that too from a server endpoint serving this JSON. The obvious problem I faced was the caching. It was always loading the stale copy. But I tackled this issue by adding a dummy URL paramater at the end.</p>\n\n<p>However, the JSON changes very rarely. So I still need to utilize the caching technique that the WebClient automatically uses. To do this I initially request a call to the server's JSON version something like, <code>http://myserver/JSONVersion</code>. This JSONVersion gets updated any time JSON is updated. </p>\n\n<p>Once I get it, i append it to my url <code>http://myserver/myjson.json?v=(JSONVERSION)</code>. This has solved my entire problem. However, I feel this is very ugly and has unnecessary excess code+logic floating around. I am hoping the HTTP Cache headers have a work around similar to the one that I am having. If so, please let me know.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows-phone-7","panorama-control","application-bar"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1725,"score":0,"question_id":6589823,"title":"WP7 Panorama control sliding lagging when hiding Application Bar","body":"<p>I have a Windows Phone app with panorama control.</p>\n\n<p>Panorama currently has two pages. </p>\n\n<p>One page should have a visible application bar with buttons, and another one should not.</p>\n\n<p>I use the panorama's SelectionChanged event to chage the IsVisible property of the ApplicationBar.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void Panorama_SelectionChanged(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            ApplicationBar.IsVisible = Panorama.SelectedIndex == 0;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The functionality I get is as desired, but with such behaviour, I get a terrible lagging (a momentary freeze of sliding animation) of my panorama.

But I did not found any sample code which will do this.</p>\n\n<p>Please help me to find sample.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","windows-phone-7","wcf-client"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":130,"score":0,"question_id":11074445,"title":"Empty config file when referencing WCF in WP7 App","body":"<p>I am trying to consume my own WCF service from a WP7 app.</p>\n\n<p>The Config File in the WCF Service </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;configuration&gt;\n\n  &lt;system.web&gt;\n    &lt;compilation debug=\"true\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/system.web&gt;  \n  &lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;services&gt;\n\n      &lt;service name=\"mergedServices.MergedService\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.RelationGeneratorServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.keywordSearchServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.QAServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.CompareWithOnePredicateInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"mergedServices.ComparisonServiceInterface\"&gt;\n          &lt;identity&gt;\n            &lt;dns value=\"localhost\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/identity&gt;\n        &lt;/endpoint&gt;\n\n\n        &lt;endpoint address=\"mex\" binding=\"mexHttpBinding\" contract=\"IMetadataExchange\" /&gt;\n        &lt;host&gt;\n          &lt;baseAddresses&gt;\n            &lt;add baseAddress=\"http://localhost:8732/Design_Time_Addresses/mergedServices/\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/baseAddresses&gt;\n        &lt;/host&gt;\n      &lt;/service&gt;\n\n    &lt;/services&gt;\n    &lt;behaviors&gt;\n      &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;\n        &lt;behavior&gt;\n          &lt;!-- To avoid disclosing metadata information, \n          set the value below to false and remove the metadata endpoint above before deployment --&gt;\n          &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\"/&gt;\n          &lt;!-- To receive exception details in faults for debugging purposes, \n          set the value below to true.

For some reason, I cannot get the grid to remember which elements have been added already. I am unsure of how to store this information so that when the MainPage is navigated from, and then back to, the grid knows which values were previously added. To better explain, what I have is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>MainPage.xaml</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=\"BrowserHost\" Grid.Row=\"1\"&gt;\n    //Items will be added in code behind\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>MainPage.xaml.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void ShowTab(int index) \n    {\n        this.currentIndex = index;\n        int count = Settings.BrowserList.Value.Count;\n\n        if (count &lt;= 0)\n        {                \n            MessageBox.Show(\"count &lt;= 0\");\n        }\n        if (currentIndex &lt;= (count - 1))  //in correct range\n        {\n            // BrowserHost does not remember previously added children elements added previously when navigated back to this page and performing this check\n            if(!BrowserHost.Children.Contains(Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser))\n                //Attempt to add browser if it was already added previously throws InvalidOperationException\n                BrowserHost.Children.Add(Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser);\n        }\n\n        if (currentIndex &gt; (count - 1))\n        {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"currentIndex &gt; (count - 1)\");\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; Settings.BrowserList.Value.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (Settings.BrowserList.Value.ElementAt(i) != null)\n            {\n                Settings.BrowserList.Value.ElementAt(i).Browser.Visibility = i == this.currentIndex ? Visibility.Visible : Visibility.Collapsed;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, the <code>ShowTab</code> method is called with a specific index value everytime the MainPage loads. A check is performed to see if <code>Settings.BrowserList.Value[currentIndex].Browser</code> (a collection with web browser instances) exists at the currentIndex in the list (these are added in another page). If the <code>BrowserHost</code> grid on MainPage already contains the child element (a browser) with a particular index, then it should skip over the check and continue to show that browser instance on the screen. This is supposed to basically implement a tabbed browsing scenario for a custom web browser control I have created. My issue is, I can consecutively add new browsers to <code>BrowserHost</code> and show them on the screen, but when I try to call a previously added webbrowser at  certain index in my collection, I get an InvalidOperationException. How would I fix this? My debugging shows that in <code>ShowTab</code> when I check to see if a browser has been added, regardless of it has or not, it jumps into attempting to add that browser to <code>BrowserHost</code> child element. If the browser has been created previously, thats when the InvalidOperationException occurs.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows-phone-7","xaml","silverlight-toolkit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12570832,"title":"Ringtone selector in wp7","body":"<p>I am working on app where I need to create some alarms and reminder.

Its same screen as in native wp7 for ringtone selection with list of ringtone and play button to listen the ringtone.Is this any control of toolkit in wp7 like listpicker in which we can bind list of tones and play from there as well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","windows-phone-7","soap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":109,"score":0,"question_id":6159083,"title":"app that get informations from web in windows phone 7","body":"<p>For my school project I need to make an app for Windows Phone 7 that give results scores and a range table of a famous football club.

I am trying to bind the <code>MapItemsControl</code> <code>ItemSource</code> to an <code>ObservableCollection</code> of <code>LocationDataSource</code>, which contain a property <code>MapPosition</code> of the type <code>GeoPoint</code>. <code>GeoPoint</code> is a simple class which contain information about the Latitude and Longitude of the location.\nThe locations which I populate into the <code>ObservableCollection</code> are fetched by a service which my <code>ViewModel</code> listens to and updates the collection when it has fetched the locations. Though it does not seem to work as no locations are shown on the map.\nTo bind the <code>GeoPoint</code>s I have made a converter which simply converts to <code>GeoCoordinate</code> which the <code>MapItemsControl</code> understands. I know the converter works as I am using it to bind to the <code>Map</code> <code>Center</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>The binding looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;maps:MapItemsControl x:Name=\"mapControl\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding Locations}\"&gt;\n    &lt;maps:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n            &lt;maps:Pushpin Location=\"{Binding MapPosition, Converter={StaticResource GeoPoint}}\" Template=\"{StaticResource pinSiteLoc}\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n    &lt;/maps:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/maps:MapItemsControl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The ViewModel looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private ObservableCollection&lt;LocationDataModel&gt; _locations;\npublic ObservableCollection&lt;LocationDataModel&gt; Locations\n{\n    get { return _locations; } \n    set\n    {\n        _locations = value;\n        FirePropertyChanged(() =&gt; Locations);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tried various ways to update the <code>Locations</code> collection, which is done in the <code>ViewModel</code> in an event handler after the <code>ViewModel</code> has loaded and is ready, I assumed this would be working:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Locations = LocationDataService.Locations;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have checked that <code>LocationDataService.Locations</code> is not empty and contains an actual location.\nI also tried intantiating the collection the the <code>ViewModel</code> constructor and then <code>add</code> each element to the collection, which did not show anything on the map either.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nAs per request in the comments.

Each pivotitem contains a list of movies. Each movie has a coverimage, and next to it a title and some other metadata. To style this as I wanted  had to use a few grids/stackpanels obviously. Also, i have a contextmenu for each item. Above my listbox I have a performance progress bar to show while the data is loaded (I get everything from a web API). My problem is that one of the lists contains a lot more movies than the others, about 100. When loading this list the app uses around 150-160 mb memory, which exceeds the limit of 90 mb. It looks like all the images and content is loaded right away (which I think causes this problem). </p>\n\n<p>What I would want is this: </p>\n\n<p>Load the title and metadata first, then load the images only where the user is currently at in the list, so that the images longer down the list arent loaded before the user scrolls down to it.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried using deferredloadlist, lazylist and normal listbox, and ive tried setting virtualization to standard and recycling, without results.
