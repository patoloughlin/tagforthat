Can you please help?</p>\n\n<p>My tasks: I run a process in .Net 4.5 (C#) and generate (generally) value types that I want to use for further analysis in other applications and therefore like to either preserve in-memory or persist on disk. More below. The data is generated within different tasks/threads and thus a row based data format does not lend itself well to match this situation (because the data generated in different threads is generated at different times and is thus not aligned). Thus I thought a columnar data structure may be suitable but please correct me if I am wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<p>Tasks/Thread #1 generates the following data at given time stamps</p>\n\n<p>datetime.ticks / value of output data</p>\n\n<p>1000000001 233.23</p>\n\n<p>1000000002 233.34</p>\n\n<p>1000000006 234.23\n...</p>\n\n<p>Taks/Thread #2 generates the following data at given time stamps</p>\n\n<p>datetime.ticks / value of output data</p>\n\n<p>1000000002 33.32</p>\n\n<p>1000000005 34.34</p>\n\n<p>1000000015 54.32\n...</p>\n\n<p>I do not need to align the time stamps at the .Net run-time, I am first and foremost after preserving the data and to process the data within R or Python at a later point.</p>\n\n<p>My requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Fast writes, fast writes, fast writes: It can happen that I generate 100,000- 1,000,000 data points per second and need to persist (worst case) or retain in memory the data. Its ok to run the writes on its own thread so this process can lag the data generation process but limitation is 16gb RAM (64bit code), more below.</p></li>\n<li><p>Preference is for columnar db format as it lends itself well to how I want to query the data later but I am open to any other structure if it makes sense in regards to the examples above (document/key-value also ok if all other requirements are met, especially in terms of write speed). </p></li>\n<li><p>API that can be referenced from within .Net. Example: HDF5 may be considered capable by some but I find their .Net port horrible.Something that supports .Net a little better would be a plus but if all other requirements are met then I can deal with something similar to the HDF5 .Net port.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Concurrent writes if possible: As described earlier I like to write data concurrently from different tasks/threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am constrained by 16gb memory (run .Net process in 64bit) and thus I probably look for something that is not purely in-memory as I may sometimes generate more data than that. Something in-memory which persists at times or a pure persistence model is probably preferable. </p></li>\n<li><p>Preference for embedded but if a server in a client/server solution can run as a windows service then no issue. </p></li>\n<li><p>In terms of data access I have strong preference for a db solution for which interfaces from R and Python already exist because I like to use the Panda library within Python for time series alignments and other analysis and run analyses within R.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the API/library supports in addition SQL/SQL-like/Linq/ like queries that would be terrific but generally I just need the absolute bare bones such as load columnar data in between start and end date (given the \"key\"/index is in such format) because I analyze and run queries within R/Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>If it comes with a management console or data visualizer that would be a plus but not a must. </p></li>\n<li><p>Should be open source or priced within \"reach\" (no, KDB does not qualify in that regards ;-)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OK, here is what I have so far, and again its all I got because most db solution simply fail already on the write performance requirement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Infobright and Db4o. I like what I read so far but I admit I have not checked into any performance stats</li>\n<li>Something done myself. I can easily store value types in binary format and index the data by datetime.ticks , I just would need to somehow write scripts to load/deserialize the data in Python/R.

What I have now works if there are opponent stats in the database, but it is possible to not have opponent stats and just have the team stats.

The issue is to do with the schema so I can still order nicely in player/clan ladders but if we want to add a stat later it won't lock our table changing every row due to one stat per column. </p>\n\n<p>I see two options for how to do this but both don't seem to be right. One is one stat per column. There would be 4 tables, user_stat_summary (for basic stats shown on ladders), user_stat_beast (teams are human vs beast), user_stat_human and user_stat_overall. Stats are shown everywhere from the last 30 days. A cron job will take any dated stats by getting a query on matches that happened after the 30 days and taking away those stats from the 3 main tables and putting them into the overall one. Matches will have blobs for the stats each player got for that match. The issue I see here is when we have a lot of rows that we can't easily add more stats when say the game changes a little. What I was thinking was a extra_stats blob column on each table and if we add new stats they simply aren't going to be sortable on the ladders. </p>\n\n<p>The other option is an EAV model which is what I have been playing around with but can't seem to get it right. I would be getting many more rows per query and then grouping them into users and the order would work for the most part but I couldn't get limits right for pagination since there was generally an unknown number of rows selected. </p>\n\n<p>What I was thinking is the EAV model with a table that stores ranks per stats which could be used for ordering. So the EAV tables are currently as follows...</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `user_stat` (\n    `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n    `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n    `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n    PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n    CONSTRAINT `user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_human_stat` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n     `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `human_user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_beast_stat` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n     `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `beast_user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_stat_overall` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `human` blob NOT NULL,\n     `beast` blob NOT NULL,\n     `total` blob NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `user_overall` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I was thinking I could add a user_stat_rank table which would be user_id, stat_id, rank. Then say I want to get the first page of the ladder ordered by the 'kills' stat I could get all the user_ids order by rank where stat_id is kills. Then make a second query to populate all the users stats. </p>\n\n<p>After writing all this out it seems like it would work fine but I might not be seeing something. I also understand this question is all over the place so if you would like me to edit in details at places just say so.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","database","jdbc","jndi"],"answer_count":8,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":237,"score":4,"question_id":11500257,"title":"What is faster: JDBC or JNDI?","body":"<p>I have two options to configure my application database connection - one is using JDBC, another one is using JNDI.

I never care about the 'added_id', I'm only using to ensure that the inserted items are clustered together on disk (since the B-Tree used to index the table in MySQL uses the primary key as the cluster index). The 'id' column contains the binary representation of a UUID -- this is the column I actually care about and all other things reference this ID. Again, I don't want the UUID to be the primary key, since the UUID is random and thus making the B-Tree created to index the table have horrible IO characteristics (at least that is what has been said elsewhere). Also, although UUID1 includes the timestamp to ensure that IDs are generated in \"sequential\" order, the inclusion of the MAC address in the ID makes it something I'd rather avoid. Thus, I'd like to use UUID4s.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, now moving on to the SQLAlchemy part. In SQLAlchemy one can define a model using their ORM for the above table by doing something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code># The SQL Alchemy ORM base class\nBase = declerative_base()\n\n# The model for table 'foo'\nclass Foo(Base):\n    __table__ = 'foo'\n    add_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\n    id = Column(Binary, index=True, unique=True, nullable=False)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this is basically the same as the SQL above. </p>\n\n<p>And now to the question. Let's say that this database is going to be sharded (horizontally partitioned) into 2 (or more) separate databases. Now, (assuming no deletions) each of these databases will have records with added_id of 1, 2, 3, etc in table foo. Since SQLAlchemy uses a session to manage the objects that are being worked on such that each object is identified only by its primary key, it seems like it would be possible to have the situation where I could end trying to access two Foo objects from the two shards with the same added_id resulting in some conflict in the managed session. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone run in to this issue? What have you done to solve it? Or, more than likely, am I missing something from the SQLAlchemy documentation that ensures that this cannot happen. However, looking at the sharding example provided with the SQLAlchemy download (examples/sharding/attribute_shard.py) they seem to side-step this issue by designating one of the database shards as an ID generator... creating an implicit bottle neck as all INSERTS  have to go against that single database to get an ID. (They also mention using UUIDs, but apparently that causes the performance issue for the indexes.)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, is there a way to set the UUID as the primary key and have the data be clustered on disk using the added_id? If it's not possible in MySQL is it possible in another DB like Postgres?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any and all input!</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","database","xcode","sqlite","uiwebview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13260369,"title":"Xcode UIWebView with SQLite Database","body":"<p>I'm creating an iPhone app that uses UIWebView, I have a MySQL database with 7 tables and about 100 rows in each table.

This is already made though.\nI just need something that can check how fast I was pressing the button the 10 times to make an anti botting system. So I thought that making a column in the database named \"time\" this \"time\" column resets itself every 10 seconds and adds 1 to the column everytime the \"click\" button is pressed. Then I can make something in my PHP script like this:\nIf time > 200 DELETE USER etc.</p>\n\n<p>So if a someone should be able to get the \"time\" column on 200 before it resets itself, it must be a bot pressing since it is not human-like to press that many times in only 10 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>I have read something about TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL but I cannot get it to woth the way I thought.

I cannot do this however unless I can control or at least estimate how much RAM one such cursor can use -- the total sum of all open result-sets could easily exceed 2 GB, and if the <em>OLE DB Cursor Service</em> tries to stuff everything into RAM, or uses a too big maximum for it's RAM buffer size, then we would run into problems.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I could always write my own buffering code that uses temp-files, but that's something that I would really like to avoid.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","database","olap","star-schema"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":1,"question_id":13233809,"title":"Python Cubes OLAP Framework - how to work with joins?","body":"<p>I'm trying to use python's olap framework <a href=\"http://packages.python.org/cubes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cubes</a> on a very simple database, but I am having some trouble joining tables.</p>\n\n<p>My schema looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Users table\nID | name\n\nProducts table\nID | name | price\n\nPurchases table\nID | user_id | product_id | date\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the cubes model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    'dimensions': [\n        {'name': 'user_id'},\n        {'name': 'product_id'},\n        {'name': 'date'},\n    ],\n    'cubes': [\n        {\n            'name': 'purchases',\n            'dimensions': ['user_id', 'product_id', 'date'],\n            'measures': ['price']\n            'mappings': {\n                'purchases.user_id': 'users.id',\n                'purchases.product_id': 'products.id',\n                'purchases.price': 'products.price'\n            },\n            'joins': [\n                {\n                    'master': 'purchases.user_id',\n                    'detail': 'users.id'\n                },\n                {\n                    'master': 'purchases.product_id',\n                    'detail': 'products.id'\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I would like to display all the purchases, showing the product's name, user's name and purchase date.

Within transaction, we might in need of directoryID, fileID (which in turn require SELECT query in DIRECTORY and FILE table) to INSERT/UPDATE FILE_VERSIONS table.</p>\n\n<p>For the above scenario, is there any other better alternative design ?. Some people have suggested to have full file name in FILE table alone eliminating DIRECTORY table. But I don't find it as a better one (as most of the directory name is getting repeated result in poor normalization).</p>\n\n<p>Normally transaction is used to INSERT/UPDATE or update queries. Do SELECT queries within transaction for InnoDB engine in MySQL affect performance ?</p>\n\n<p>Kindly share some of your ideas for this case to handle better way for directories and files.</p>\n\n<p>thanks,\nprabu</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","database","integer"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13227412,"title":"store integer value into android database","body":"<p>In android, how can get I get a value (that is of type integer) from <code>EditText</code> and insert it into database that has a integer field?</p>\n\n<p>I am using the below code but it doesn't save integer data into database!</p>\n\n<pre><code>EditText Price;\nname = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.txt_GoodsName);\nPrice = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.txt_Price);\ndb.insertQuote(name.getText().toString(),Price.getText());\n\n// ----------------------------------------------------------\n\npublic long insertQuote(String Quote,int Price1) \n{\n    ContentValues initialValues = new ContentValues();\n    initialValues.put(GoodName, Quote);\n    initialValues.put(Price, Price1);\n    return db.insert(DATABASE_TABLE, null, initialValues);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","database","data","import"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":13043304,"title":"Auto Import Mysql from XSLX","body":"<p>I have datas that will be added monthly, every month I must import more than 30 XSLX!

My first draft, with a joining class, looks like this: <a href=\"http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2756/photodb2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2756/photodb2.png</a></p>\n\n<p>And then I just get confused about what I'm actually trying to achieve with the joining class. A Slideshow can contain many Photographs and a Photograph can appear in many Slideshows.</p>\n\n<p>With the joining class, SlideshowView, I think I'm creating an \"instance\" of a Slideshow, where that specific Slideshow can only contain one instance of any one Photograph. In this case, I'm confused about the relationship between the SlideshowView and Slideshow!</p>\n\n<p>In fact, looking over this again, my diagram makes even less sense... A SlideshowView can only contain one Slideshow, but a Slideshow can be part of more than one SlideshowView? The trouble is, if I make the relationship one-to-one, doesn't that make SlideshowView redundant?</p>\n\n<p>When I think about this from a programming perspective, I would simply ask the user to select a Slideshow that would contain many Photographs, in which case, what is the difference between Slideshow and SlideshowView? Am I over-complicating this? It's really \"twisting my melon\"! Any advice on how to proceed with this would be gratefully received.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","database","activerecord"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13221541,"title":"How to disable database connection for local development?","body":"<p>I'm currently developing my Rails app on my local machine.

I absolutely hate dbunit. Before I do, I want to know if someone already did it.</p>\n\n<p>Things i dislike about dbunit:</p>\n\n<p>1) The simplest format to write and get started is deprecated. They want you to use formats that are bloated. Some even require xml schemas. Yeah, whatever.</p>\n\n<p>2) They populate rows not in the order you write them, but in the order tables are defined in the xml file. This is really bad because you can't order your data in such a way that foreign key constraints won't cause problems. This just forces you to go through the hassle of turning them off altogether. </p>\n\n<p>This also wastes time and bloats up your junit base classes to include code to disable the foreign key constraints. You will probably have to test for the database type (hsqldb, etc.) and disable them in database-specific ways. This is way bad.</p>\n\n<p>It could be better if dbunit helped in disabling foreign key constraints as part of their framework automatically, but they don't do this. They do keep track of dialects... so why not use them for this? Ultimately, all of this does is force the programmer to waste time and not get up and testing quickly.</p>\n\n<p>3) XML is a pain to write. I don't need to say more about this. They also offer so many ways to do it, that I think it just complicates matters. Just offer one really solid way and be done with it.</p>\n\n<p>4) When your data gets large, keeping track of the ids and their consistent/correct relationships is a royal pain. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if you don't work on a project for a month, how are you to remember that user_id 1 was an admin, user_id 2 was a business user, user_id 3 was an engineer and user_id 4 was something else? Going back to check this is wasting more time. There should be a meaningful way to retrieve it other than an arbitrary number.</p>\n\n<p>5) It's slow. I've found that unless hsqldb is used, it is painfully slow. It doesn't have to be. There are also numerous ways to mess up its configuration as it is not easy to do \"out of the box\". There is a hump that you must go through to get it working right. All this does is encourage people to not use it, or be pissed of when they do start to use it.</p>\n\n<p>6) Some values tend to repeat a lot, likes dates. It'd be nice to specify defaults, or even have the framework put defaults in automatically, even without you telling it to put defaults in there. That way you can create objects just with the values you want, and leave the rest off. This sure beats specifying every nook and cranny of a column if it's not required.</p>\n\n<p>7) Probably the most annoying thing is that the first entry must include ALL the values - even null placeholders - or future rows won't pick the columns that you actually specified.</p>\n\n<p>DBunit doesn't have a sensible default for translating [NULL] to a real null value either. You have to manually add it. Tell me, who hasn't done this with dbunit? Everyone has. It shouldn't be like this!</p>\n\n<p>What this means is that if you have a polymorphic object, you must declare all the foreign keys to the joining tables of each subclass in the first row, even though they are null. If you do a table for all subclasses pattern, you still have to specify all the fields on the first row. This is just awful.</p>\n\n<p>Anything out there to satisfy me, or should I become the next framework developer of a much better database testing framework?</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","relational-database","diagram"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13213632,"title":"How relations I should use?

I have a hard time grasping the purpose of schemas in PostgreSQL.. and in general.  What are the potential use-cases for schemas? </p>\n\n<p>The book I have states that schemas are like directories that can't be nested.  OK, so I take it schemas are a means to group tables in a db.  The book does not address how this is implemented, nor does it mention the potential uses except for one trivial example (next paragraph).</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Benefit &amp; Potential use case #1</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Thus far I have only understood one (seemingly trivial) benefit to schemas.  This benefit being that you can have multiple tables with the same name and as long as each such table is in a different schema, there will be no conflict because the namespace qualifier (the schema name) can be used to address the particular table desired.</p>\n\n<p>I don't really understand why you would have multiple tables of the same name to begin with. I'd think this is an extremely rare case, yet the docs come accross to me as if schemas should be used by everyone.  Having multiple tables of the same name seems like poor project management to me and allowing for such bad practice doesn't seem like value.\nIn the end you are just allowing for a mess to be made.  </p>\n\n<p>The only scenario I can think of where you could have name conflicts of tables which should be allowed is when you have a class that is learning SQL and the school IT admin wants each student to be able to create tables of their liking. Of course, the question in my mind is why doesn't the admin just create 1 db per student rather than 1 db for all and 1 schema for each student?  <strong>Q1:</strong> Why?</p>\n\n<p>What are some other use cases that show the benefit of schemas? </p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION - OR - NATURE OF</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I'm also confused about the implementation/nature of schemas.<br>\nLet us assume that we have 1 DB which has 3 schemas. 1 schema per user as such:<br>\n<strong>user1='admin'</strong>  -- tableA, tableU, tableJ, tableK,<br>\n<strong>user2='joe</strong>'  ------ tableU, tableJ,<br>\n<strong>user3='kate</strong> ----- tableU, tableK.     </p>\n\n<p>In the above example, my intention is for <strong>tableU</strong> to be shared between the users (accross the schema joe &amp; schema kate).  They shouldn't get their own stand-alone copy of the table, they should share common access to this table.  This type of usage makes sense to me.  Users should be adding/modding/potentially removing records... not adding/modding/removing tables.  I am not sure however that this is possible with PostgreSQL schemas.  <strong>Q2:</strong> If I wanted to share tableU as I described above, would schema joe &amp; schema kate each get thair own copy of the table or can I specify that they should not get their own copy and instead just share access to an existing table?</p>\n\n<p><strong>tableJ</strong> is the <strong>same</strong> as <strong>tableK</strong>... except that Kate can't use tableJ and joe can't use tableK.  This seems to be the essence of schemas to me according to my limited understanding of schemas.  <strong>Q3:</strong> What is the purpose of making a copy of a table for each user?  The 2 tables have the same structure (columns and constraints) and it is a waste of storage space to make a stand alone copy of such a table for each user.  I'd also think that it would be nightmare if each user had their own copy of every table.  We'd be throwing key concepts like normalization out the window.  It would be an unmaintainable mess.  In my mind each user should be adding/modifying/ removing records to a common table in a common DB. </p>\n\n<p>I've seen people in my Google searches about schemas make a separate schema+tables for each online customer to their website.  They have like 100,000 schemas.  <strong>Q4:</strong> What am I missing here?  This seems extreme to say the least.  They should be adding record(s) to standard table(s) for each customer not making schemas and tables for each customer. This only adds to my confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I hope I've stated the key points of my confusion clearly enough.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking for is:<br>\n(1) To clear up the benefits of schemas via realistic use case examples.<br>\n(2) To clear up the implementation detail of schemas.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT v.3</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential use case #2</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I understood Neville K correctly, he suggest as a use case:</p>\n\n<p>1 DB which has 3 schemas. 1 schema per user as such (username==schema_name in ex.):<br>\n<strong>user1='admin'</strong>  -- tableA, tableLogin, tblFin1, tblFin2, tblFin3, tblPrj1, tblPrj2, tblPrj3.<br>\n<strong>user2='joe</strong>'  ------ tableLogin, tblFin1, tblFin2, tblFin3<br>\n<strong>user3='kate</strong> ----- tableLogin, tblPrj1, tblPrj2, tblPrj3. </p>\n\n<p>Here, joe is in Fin department, and Kate is project manager.  The app that joe uses is restricted to Finance related tables, the application that kate uses is restricted to project management tables.  This restriction is enforced via their user name being tied to a schema which is tied to a search path (enforced at DB level).  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q5:</strong> Wouldn't the same restriction be in place without schemas?  What tables are available to which application is a function of what tables were set to be used by the application at the time the application was made by the dev team. No?  Or are we assuming that we are using off the shelf applications that you point to a db and we are concerned that the application can not in its settings be restricted to certain tables (and this restriction locked with a password within the off-the-shelf application)? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential use case #3</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I understood Catcall correctly, he suggest as a use case:</p>\n\n<p>A scenario where you wish to rent/lease the services of a database server hosted on 1 physical system to multiple customers needing database service. As such, a multi-tenant like scenario arises.  At this point you can choose to have:<br>\n(1) A separate database for each tenant (customer)<br>\n  -More secure and convenient but can support less tenants per system.<br>\n(2) One shared database with a schema for each tenant (customer)<br>\n  -Less secure and slightly less convenient but can support more tenants per system.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential use case #4</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I understood Scott Marlowe and Catcall correctly, another use case would be:</p>\n\n<p>Using schemas to isolate the new content of developers during development.  Later can merge work to another schema.        </p>\n"},{"tags":["database","google-chrome","google-chrome-extension"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":1,"question_id":13206250,"title":"Connecting Chrome extension to server","body":"<p>I know that Google Chrome extension can have some HTML and JavaScript.

For an explanation I wrote a small test program. At the end you'll find some questions I have about that.</p>\n\n<h2>Declaration</h2>\n\n<p>Here we have a class \"Test\" which represents our test dataset. It only has an ID (primary key) and a \"value\" property. In our TestContext we implement a DbSet Tests, which shall handle our \"Test\" objects as a database table.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public int value { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class TestContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet&lt;Test&gt; Tests { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Initialization</h2>\n\n<p>Now, we remove any (if existent) entries from our \"Tests\" table and add our one and only \"Test\" object. It has ID=1 (primary key) and value=10.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create a new DBContext...\nTestContext db = new TestContext();\n\n// Remove all entries...\nforeach (Test t in db.Tests) db.Tests.Remove(t);\ndb.SaveChanges();\n\n// Add one test entry...\ndb.Tests.Add(new Test { ID = 1, value = 10 });\ndb.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Tests</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, we run some tests. We select our entry by it's original value (=10) and we change the \"value\" of our entry to 4711. BUT, we do not call db.SaveChanges(); !!!</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Find our entry by it's value (=10)\nvar result = from r in db.Tests\n             where r.value == 10\n             select r;\nTest t2 = result.FirstOrDefault();\n\n// change its value from 10 to 4711...\nt2.value = 4711;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we try to find the (old) entry by the original value (=10) and do some tests on the results of that.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// now we try to select it via its old value (==10)\nvar result2 = from r in db.Tests\n             where r.value == 10\n             select r;\n\n// Did we get it?\nif (result2.FirstOrDefault() != null &amp;&amp; result2.FirstOrDefault().value == 4711)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"We found the changed entry by it's old value...\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When running the program we'll actually see \"We found the changed entry by it's old value...\". That means we have run a query for r.value == 10, found something... This would be acceptable. BUT, get receive the already changed object (not fulfilling value == 10)!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll get an empty result set for \"where r.value == 4711\".</p>\n\n<p>In some further testing, we find out, that the Entity Framework always hands out a reference to the same object. If we change the value in one reference, it's changed in the other one too. Well, that's ok... but one should know it happens.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Test t3 = result2.FirstOrDefault();    \nt3.value = 42;\nif (t2.value == 42)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Seems as if we have a reference to the same object...\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>When running a LINQ query on the same Database Context (without calling SaveChanges()) we will receive references to the same object, if it has the same primary key. The strange thing is: Even, if we change an object we will find it (only!) by it's old values. But we will receive a reference to the already changed object. This means that the restrictions in our query (value == 10) is not guaranteed for any entries that we changed since our last call of SaveChanges().</p>\n\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, I'll probably have to live with some effects here. But I, would like to avoid to \"SaveChanges()\" after every little change. Especially, because I would like to use it for transaction handling... to be able to revert some changes, if something goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I would be glad, if anyone could answer me one or even both of the following questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a possibility to change the behavior of entity framework to work as if I would communicate with a normal database during a transaction? If so... how to do it?</p></li>\n<li><p>Where is a good resource for answering \"How to use the context of entity framework?\" which answers questions like \"What can I rely on?\" and \"How to choose the scope of my DBContext object\"?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>EDIT #1</h2>\n\n<p>Richard just explained how to access the original (unchanged) database values. While this is valuable and helpful I've got the urge to clarify the goal ... </p>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at what happens when using SQL. We setup a table \"Tests\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Tests (ID INT, value INT, PRIMARY KEY(ID));\nINSERT INTO Tests (ID, value) VALUES (1,10);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we have a transaction, that first looks for entities whose values are 10. After this, we update the value of these entries and look again for those entries. In SQL we already work on the updated version, so we will not find any results for our second query. After all we do a \"rollback\", so the value of our entry should be 10 again...</p>\n\n<pre><code>START TRANSACTION;\n\nSELECT ID, value FROM Tests WHERE value=10; {1 result}\nUPDATE Tests SET value=4711 WHERE ID=1; {our update}\n\nSELECT ID, value FROM Tests WHERE value=10; {no result, as value is now 4711}\n\nROLLBACK; { just for testing transactions... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would like to have exactly this behavior for the Entity Framework (EF), where db.SaveChanges(); is equivalent to \"COMMIT\", where all LINQ queries are equivalent to \"SELECT\" statements and every write access to an entity is just like an \"UPDATE\". I don't care about when the EF does actually calls the UPDATE statement, but it should behave the same way as using a SQL Database the direct way... Of course, if \"SaveChanges()\" is called and returning successfully it should be guaranteed that all data was persisted correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Yes, I could call db.SaveChanges() before every query, but then I would loose the possibility for a \"Rollback\".</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Stefan</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","database","email","input-validation"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":74,"score":-1,"question_id":13141778,"title":"error in PHP code for email validation","body":"<p>I am trying to create an email validation form for my database but am having a number of issues.

This is the database you typically use along with <code>ContentProviders</code> and which resides in <code>/data/data/yourpackage/databases/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>One would think this is a common case. However the docs aren't clear on what to do: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html</a>. <strong>There is no <code>BackupHelper</code> specifically for these typical databases. Hence I used the <code>FileBackupHelper</code></strong>, pointed it to my .db file in \"<code>/databases/</code>\", introduced locks around any db operation (such as <code>db.insert</code>) in my <code>ContentProviders</code>, and even tried creating the \"<code>/databases/</code>\" directory before <code>onRestore()</code> because it does not exist after install.</p>\n\n<p>I have implemented a similar solution for the <code>SharedPreferences</code> successfully in a different app in the past. However when I test my new implementation in the emulator-2.2, I see a backup being performed to <code>LocalTransport</code> from the logs, as well as a restore being performed (and <code>onRestore()</code> called). <strong>Yet, the db file itself is never created.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note that this is all after an install, and before first launch of the app, after the restore has been performed. Apart from that my test strategy was based on <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html#Testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html#Testing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Please also note I'm not talking about some sqlite database I manage myself, nor about backing up to SDcard, own server or elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>I did see a mention in the docs about databases advising to use a custom <code>BackupAgent</code> but it does not seem related:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, you might want to extend\n  BackupAgent directly if you need to:\n      * Back up data in a database. If you have an SQLite database that you\n  want to restore when the user\n  re-installs your application, you need\n  to build a custom BackupAgent that\n  reads the appropriate data during a\n  backup operation, then create your\n  table and insert the data during a\n  restore operation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Some clarity please.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I really need to do it myself up to the SQL level, then I'm worried about the following topics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Open databases and transactions. I have no idea how to close them from such a singleton class outside of my app's workflow.</p></li>\n<li><p>How to notify the user that a backup is in progress and the database is locked. It might take a long time, so I might need to show a progress bar.</p></li>\n<li><p>How to do the same on restore. As I understand, the restore might happen just when the user has already started using the app (and inputting data into the database). So you can't presume to just restore the backupped data in place (deleting the empty or old data). You'll have to somehow join it in, which for any non-trivial database is impossible due to the id's.</p></li>\n<li><p>How to refresh the app after the restore is done without getting the user stuck at some - now - unreachable point.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can I be sure the database has already been upgraded on backup or restore?

For example, we have a tables</p>\n\n<pre><code>PRODUCTS with primary key (NAME,CATEGORY,SHORTNAME) and some data\nPRICE_LISTING (NAME,CATEGORY,SHORTNAME) - foreign key to PRODUCT, and some data like price\nPRODUCT_ALTERNATIVES (ORIGINAL_NAME,ORIGINAL_CATEGORY,ORIGINAL_SHORTNAME; REPLACEMENT_NAME,REPLACEMENT_CATEGORY,REPLACEMENT_SHORTNAME) - foreign keys to PRODUCTS\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>as you can see, whenever product name changes, lot of data in other tables has to change. The original author solved this with cascading update on the foreign keys. For some reasons, MS SQL doesn't allow me to use cascading update on the foreign key, so the database cannot be migrated so easily. </p>\n\n<p>What makes things worse is that the software has a lot of editing screens, that use DataSets, DataGridViews and binding in Windows Forms, so the editor works pretty much automagically. For example, editor for <code>PRODUCTS</code> is a simple windows form, and whenever user renames a product (changes its <code>NAME</code>), the changes are propagated through database (via cascading update) to <code>PRICE_LISTING</code> and <code>PRODUCT_ALTERNATIVES</code> tables. And also, if the app wants to show price listings, it does simple <code>SELECT * FROM PRICE_LISTING</code> that includes product names and price.</p>\n\n<p>One approach might be to add surrogate keys - <code>ID</code> identity columns to each table, then modify for example <code>PRICE_LISTING</code> table to (<code>PRODUCT_ID, price</code>) etc. But then, to show price, I'd have to define view that will </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT *,PRODUCT.NAME,PRODUCT.CATEGORY,PRODUCT.SHORTNAME FROM PRICE_LISTING join PRODUCT on ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then, the automatically generated DataSets etc. will have to be modified to select from view, update the view.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell and from the original author's perspective, we are breaking the program and making it more complicated. The only single thing that does not work when ported in a straightforward manner is the cascading update, but I see that the database design is very flawed and it will be a maintenance nightmare if not fixed.</p>\n\n<p>What to do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","sql-server","database","tsql"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":13117710,"title":"How to export all words from sql table or sql database","body":"<p>Let's say we have following table.</p>\n\n<pre>\nUserId | Message\n-------|-------------\n1      | Hi, have a nice day\n2      | Hi, I had a nice day\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>I need to have all { Hi,-have-a-nice-day-I-had } words separately.\nIs there any way to do that ?

The interesting thing is, there is one big table which we figured out is copied in a funny way, it is huge and its just copied few initial records, say like 2000-5000 and it copied last records say 400000-500000 and there is no records in between. isnt that weird? cause while we imported we checked initial and last entries and thought it copied everything. Then We created a new DB and imported a dump again and now it seems to be ok, but we have the new entry already in our live DB(13GB data), so we have to copy those and add to our newl imported DB. What will be the idle way to copy those new records in to recovered DB? I mean some query which will search the new DB and add only new records found. SO do I have to take dump of our 13 GB and then import? or is there anyways to copy from live DB?</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","full-text-search","nosql","couchdb","riak"],"answer_count":10,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":13,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6387,"score":13,"question_id":5453872,"title":"Full-text search in NoSQL databases","body":"<ul>\n<li>Has anyone here have any experience deploying a real online system that had a full text search in any of the NoSQL databases? </li>\n<li>For example, how does the full-text search compare in MongoDB, Riak and CouchDB? </li>\n<li>Some of the metric that I am looking for is ease of deployment and maintaince and of course speed.</li>\n<li>How mature are they?

I am definitely  missing something.\n I would really appreciate if anyone can steer me towards the right direction as I've been suck with this for a couple of days plz.</p>\n\n<p>The code is as follows   </p>\n\n<pre><code>     &lt;form action=\"\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;table width=\"436\" border=\"0px\"&gt;\n        &lt;tr class=\"even\"&gt;\n            &lt;td width=\"132\"&gt;&lt;label for=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td width=\"333\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"text\" size=\"40px\" name=\"title\" value=\"\"  /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;tr class=\"odd\"&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;label style=\" text-align:top\" for=\"icon_description\"&gt;short description&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name=\"icon_description\" rows=\"2\" cols=\"30\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;tr class=\"even\"&gt;\n      &lt;td height=\"95\"&gt;&lt;label for=\"full_description\"&gt;full description&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name=\"full_description\" cols=\"30\" rows=\"6\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;tr class=\"odd\"&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;label for=\"category\"&gt;category&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;select name=\"category\" &gt;\n            &lt;?php\n            foreach(get_categories() as $category)\n            {\n                ?&gt;\n                &lt;option value=\"&lt;?php echo $category['id']; ?&gt;\"&gt; &lt;?php echo $category['category_name']; ?&gt; &lt;/option&gt;\n                &lt;?php\n            }\n            ?&gt;\n\n        &lt;/select&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr class=\"even\"&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;&lt;label for=\"price\"&gt;price (&lt;em&gt;BsF&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name=\"price\" rows=\"1\" cols=\"20\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr class=\"odd\"&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;&lt;label for=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name=\"stock\" rows=\"1\" cols=\"20\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr class=\"even\"&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td style=\"margin-top:30px\"&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align:left; margin-left:20px;\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Product\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n          &lt;/form&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the same page, at the top of the document I have this code to handle the data from form and send it to the actual function that adds it to database:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\ninclude_once('init.php');\ninclude_once('store.php');\n\n$products = get_all_available_products();\n\n\nif( isset($_POST['title'], $_POST['icon_description'], $_POST['category'], $_POST['price'], $_POST['stock']) )\n{\n\n    $title = $_POST['title'];\n    $icon_description = $_POST['icon_description'];\n    $category = $_POST['category'];\n    $price = $_POST['price'];\n    $stock = $_POST['stock'];\n\n\n    $errors = array();\n\n    if( empty($title) )\n    {\n        $errors[] = 'You need to add a title.';\n    }\n    else if( strlen($title) &gt; 125 )\n    {\n        $errors[] = 'Title cannot be longer than 255 characters.';\n    }\n    if( empty($icon_description))\n    {\n        $errors[] = 'Short description is empty.';\n    }\n    if( empty($price))\n    {\n        $errors[] = 'You need to specify a price.';\n    }\n    if( empty($stock))\n    {\n        $errors[] = 'You need to ad stock amount.';\n    }\n\n\n    add_product($title, $category, $icon_description, $price, $stock);\n\n    header('Location: products.php');\n    die();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the code where the add_product() function is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>include_once('init.php');\n\nfunction add_product($title, $category_id, $description, $price, $stock)\n{\n    $title =  mysql_real_escape_string($title);\n    $category_id = (int)($category_id);\n    $description = mysql_real_escape_string($description);\n    $price = doubleval($price);\n    $stock = (int)$stock;\n\n    $mysql_query(\"INSERT INTO `products` SET\n                `product_name` = '{$title}',\n                `product_description` = '{$description}',\n                `category_id` = {$category_id},\n                `price` = {$price},\n                `stock` = {$stock}\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All my other code to display the products in databse is working, so connection and configuration is ok (i think).

The main aim of the DB would be to get rapid queries on various aspects of this folder (total size, size of any folder, history of a folder and all it's contents, etc). </p>\n\n<p>However, I realized that finding <em>all</em> the files inside a folder, including all of it's sub-folders is not possible without recursive queries if I just make a \"file\" table with just a parent_directory field. I consider this as one of the most important features I want in my code, so I have considered two schema options for this as shown in the figure below.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In schema 1, I store all the file names in one table and directory names in another table. They both have a \"parentdir\" item, but also have a text (apparently text/blob are the same in sqlite) field called \"FullPath\" that will save the entire path from the root to the particular file/directory (like /etc/abc/def/wow/longpath/test.txt). I'm not assuming a maximum subfolder limit so this could <em>theoretically</em> be a field that allows up to 30K characters. My idea is that then if I want all the files or directories belonging to any parent I just query the fullpath of the parent on this field and get the fileIDs</p></li>\n<li><p>In schema 2, I store only filenames, fileIDs and DirNames, DirIDs in the directories and files tables, respectively. But in a third table called \"Ancestors\", I store for each file a set of entries for each directory that is it's ancestor (so in the above example, test.txt will have 5 entries, pointing to the DirIDs of the folders etc,abc,def,wow and longpath respectively). Then if I want the full contents of any folder I just look for the DirID in this table and get all the fileIDs.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can see that in schema 1 the main limit might be full-text search of variable length text column and in schema 2 the main limit being that I might have to add a ton of entries for files that are buried deep within 100 directories or something. </p>\n\n<p>What would be the best of these solutions?

Clearly, this is going to require the ability to be able to set the values of various Identity columns when inserting.  I'm using a code-first approach.  By default, <code>DbContext</code> handles the database connection and so you can't <code>SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[MyTable] ON</code>.  So, what I've done so far is use the <code>DbContext</code> constructor that lets me specify a DB connection to be used.  Then, I set <code>IDENTITY_INSERT</code> to <code>ON</code> in that DB connection, and then try to insert my records using entity framework.  Here's an example of what I've got so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyUserSeeder : IEntitySeeder {\n    public void InitializeEntities(AssessmentSystemContext context, SqlConnection connection) {\n        context.MyUsers.Add(new MyUser { MyUserId = 106, ConceptPersonId = 520476, Salutation = \"Mrs\", Firstname = \"Novelette\", Surname = \"Aldred\", Email = null, LoginId = \"520476\", Password=\"28c923d21b68fdf129b46de949b9f7e0d03f6ced8e9404066f4f3a75e115147489c9f68195c2128e320ca9018cd711df\", IsEnabled = true, SpecialRequirements = null });\n        try {\n            connection.Open();\n            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(\"SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[MyUser] ON\", connection);\n            int retVal = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\n            context.SaveChanges();\n        }\n        finally {\n            connection.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So close and yet so far - because, although <code>cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()</code> works fine, when I then run <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, I'm informed that \"Explicit value must be specified for identity column in table 'MyUser' either when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to ON or when a replication user is inserting into a NOT FOR REPLICATION identity column.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, because MyUserId (which is the Identity column in the MyUser table) is the primary key, entity framework doesn't try to set it when I call <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, even though I gave the <code>MyUser</code> entity a value for the <code>MyUserId</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to force entity framework to try and insert even primary key values for an entity, then?  Or maybe a way to temporarily mark <code>MyUserId</code> as not being a primary key value, so EF tries to insert it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","database","forms","login","user"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":5,"view_count":46,"score":-5,"question_id":13101368,"title":"Java - log in, store users in database","body":"<p>i have problem with the development of user interface in my web application.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The plan is:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User write his username and password in login form and submit.</li>\n<li>The request comes to login servlet.</li>\n<li>Servlet looks to the database for that user and check pass etc..</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know about SSL, form based authentication, checking roles and storing users in DD web.xml.</p>\n\n<p>But i need to store lots of users in database because of automation of creating.

John is authorized since he is logged in and he passes the built-in authorization scheme, but he does not have the right to edit Mary's blos post. I hope you get the picture.</p>\n\n<p>I know about authorization in ASP.NET MVC and I know that I can build my own custom IAuthorizationFilter. However, <strong>my authorization filter has to access the database</strong> (DbContext in my case) in order to check whether the entity being edited/deleted, i.e. BlogPost number 5 is owned by the currently logged in user. In other words, the currently logged in user can only edit and delete his \"stuff\". Each \"stuff\" knows the user that owns it.</p>\n\n<p>Something like this in pseude code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var currentlyLoggedUser = this.dbContext.UserProfiles.Single(user =&gt; user.Username == this.User.Identity.Name); \n\nif (blogPost.UserProfile != currentlyLoggedUser)\n{\n// \"John you are not allowed to edit someone else's blog post, you bad boy\".\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, my two simple questions are:\n1. What is the \"best practices\" way to <strong>access the database from within a custom IAuthorizationFilter</strong>? Should I somehow inject my IRepository (the interface serving my DbContext) into the authorization filter attribute? Should I try to find my IRepository from the Controller from within the OnAuthorization method of my filter? Is it ok to access the DB from within a filter in the first place?\n2. If using an IAuthorizationFilter for this task is not the \"best practices\" way to do this, then what is?</p>\n\n<p>So to summarize:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make sure that the currently logged user can edit/delete only his \"stuff\", if every \"stuff\" knows the user that owns it?</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["php","database","database-backups"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13082572,"title":"sql files not getting backed up","body":"<p>The following code does not throw any errors but the databases dont get backed up with new data;</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\ninclude('conn.php');\n$dbhost=\"localhost\";\n$dbuser=\"landshop_anitgop\";\n$dbpass=\"password\";\n\n$source=array(\"landshop_formdata.sql\",\"landshop_clientdata.sql\",\"landshop_blogs.sql\",\"landshop_counter.sql\",\"landshop_hitems.sql\");\n\n$path = '\"C:/Program Files/EasyPHP-5.3.8.1/www/Landshoppe/Downloaded Dbs/\"';\n\n        $mysqldump = '\"pathToExe\".mysqldump.exe\"';\n       foreach($source as $db) {\n            $dbsource= $path.$db;\n            $command = \"mysql -u{$dbuser} -p{$dbpass} {$db} &lt; \".$path.\"backup_{$db}.sql\";\n       system($command,$output);\n       echo \"Backed Up : \".$db.\" Output [\".print_r($output,1).\"]&lt;br&gt;\";\n\n     //system('mysql -u &lt;user&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; dbname &lt; filename.sql');  \n\n\n\n}\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Dont know whats going wrong ..</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","oracle","stored-procedures","database-link"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24727,"score":12,"question_id":240788,"title":"How to execute an Oracle stored procedure via a database link","body":"<p>Can I call a stored procedure in Oracle via a database link?</p>\n\n<p>The database link is functional so that syntax such as...</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM myTable@myRemoteDB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is functioning.

Problem is, as soon as I push the number of buckets to 30 millions or over, the insert rate is down to 10-500 records/s from the beginning.

What is the basic problem in the use of Databases in this type of software that caused them not to be used this way, or new algorithms or techniques not being developed or studied for optimizing the benefits of using them this way?

Provided for FAST are several APIs for extracting the compressed data into readable CSV values with some limited searching parameters (ie. the ability to extract all financial data from a given hour based on the product or exchange).</p>\n\n<p>In this system, we will need to be able to pass financial quotes to the automated strategy to run our simulation so we will either need to incorporate the functionality of the FAST API into the system to retrieve the relevant data for simulation or we need to extract the data ahead of time and store it elsewhere.

A given repository might produce no packages, or several, but if there are more than one for a given repository then a particular version for that repository will indicate a single \"tag\" of the codebase.  </p>\n\n<p>A particular version \"string\" might be used to tag a version of the source code in more than one repository, but there may be no relationship between \"1.0\" for two different repos.  So if packages P and Q both come from repo R, then P 1.0 and Q 1.0 are both built from the 1.0 tag of repo R.  But if package X comes from repo Y, then X 1.0 has no relationship to P 1.0.</p>\n\n<p>In my (simplified) model, I have the following tables (the x_id columns are auto-incrementing surrogate keys; you can pretend I'm using a different primary key if you wish, it's not really important):</p>\n\n<pre><code>repository\n- repository_id\n- repository_name (unique)\n... \n\nversion\n- version_id\n- version_string (unique for a particular repository)\n- repository_id\n...\n\npackage\n- package_id\n- package_name (unique)\n- repository_id\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This makes it easy for me to see, for example, what are valid versions of a given package: I can join with the version table using the repository_id.  However, suppose I would like to add some information to this database, e.g., to indicate which package versions have been approved for release.  I certainly need a new table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package_version\n- version_id\n- package_id\n- package_version_released\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, the nature of the keys that I use are not really important to my problem, and you can imagine that the data column is \"promotion_level\" or something if that helps.  </p>\n\n<p>My doubts arise when I realize that there's really a very close relationship between the version_id and the package_id in my new table ... they must share the same repository_id.  Only a small subset of package/version combinations are valid.  So I should have some kind of constraint on those columns, enforcing that ...</p>\n\n<p>... I don't know, it just feels off, somehow.  Like I'm including somehow more information than I really need?  I don't know how to explain my hesitance here.  I can't figure out which (if any) normal form I'm violating, but I also can't find an example of a schema with this sort of structure ... not being a DBA by profession I'm not sure where to look.  </p>\n\n<p>So I'm asking: am I just being overly sensitive?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","database","linq","linq-to-sql"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":15,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11223,"score":15,"question_id":4221,"title":"LinqDataSource - Can you limit the amount of records returned?","body":"<p>I'd like to use a <code>LinqDataSource</code> control on a page and limit the amount of records returned.

So now I have a list of say 250 phone numbers. I want to send these phone numbers back to the server and check to see which of these phone numbers belong to a User account.</p>\n\n<p>So I need to do a query: <code>query = User.query(User.phone.IN(phones_list))</code></p>\n\n<p>However, with GAE, this is quite an expensive query.

Is there something like: </p>\n\n<p><code>INSERT INTO x LEFT JOIN y ON x.id = y.id VALUES(...)?</code></p>\n\n<p>The best I could come up with is a stored proc that does:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO x\nSELECT id FROM x (or @@id)\nINSERT INTO y\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seems counter to the whole relational model... </p>\n\n<p>It's the insert equivalent of not having joins. Would we put up with having to do multiple selects and join the results together ourselves?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","database","nested-forms"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13020129,"title":"Ruby on Rails: what does build_model do?","body":"<p>I have a user and profile models and I use the same form to populate them.\nIn my controller I have the line:\n@user.build_profile</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know what does this line do.

So the first column is date, second one is a working time which is between (06:00-23:00), third column is night shift between (23:00-06:00), fourth column is Total of day and night shift, fifth column is only filled if fourth column is bigger then 8 i.e. 9h of total - 8 is 1,sixth column is only filled if Total of(day and night shifts) at the bottom is bigger then 48h and then difference is written in that last column.</p>\n\n<p>My current table with data has this columns: <code>user_key,id,time</code></p>\n\n<p>Now this would be an example of what should query do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    1. user_key(100), id(1), time(15:00); \n    2. user_key(200), id(2), time(15:05); \n    3. user_key(100), id(3), time(16:00); \n    4. user_key(100), id(4), time(16:05); \n    5. user_key(100), id(5), time(17:05); \n\n    3.-1. = 1h \n    5.-4. = 1h \n\n    Result: \n    user_key(100), day_shift(2h)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So we user_key is unique for each user and id is auto-incrementing, we always need to take first and the second record for the same user and save result and then second two records for that user and save working time and so on...\nHow to achieve this? I need to use some sql variables? Of course it has to have to options if it is a day shift and night shift as we don't want to save working time in the wrong column.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>As I see that lot of you didn't understood what I really need.\nI will try to explain it a bit more.</p>\n\n<p>When user signs in it has it own user_key written. When he signs out then I wrote user_key(0) in the table after that another user can sing in and so on. So basically I need to see first unique user key in the for example day shift and get the last. The last user_key we can get just to check if the next user_key is different. If the next user key is the different then we have the first one and the last one and difference between them needs to be saved in the variable. Then for example we have some other users and later on we have again pair of user_key then we just need to add the difference between them to the same variable and so on...</p>\n\n<p>My problem can be solved in PHP too. For example we can get only values for certain user_key and for the certain time. Then in php we can go trough the data and check.</p>\n\n<p>Please provide me with some examples</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1447, 0, 2012-10-21 13:32:15.453\n1448, 0, 2012-10-21

The table already has a clustered index for the correct order so getting the records themselves is pretty fast. I'm trying to use LINQ to SQL to simplify the code that I need to write. The problem is that I don't want to load all the objects into memory, since the DataContext seems to keep them around -- yet trying to page them results in horrible performance problems.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the breakdown. Original attempt was this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var logs = \n    (from record in dataContext.someTable \n     where [index is appropriate]\n     select record);\n\nforeach( linqEntity l in logs )\n{\n    // Do stuff with data from l\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is pretty fast, and streams at a good rate, but the problem is that the memory use of the application keeps going up never stops. My guess is that the LINQ to SQL entities are being kept around in memory and not being disposed properly. So after reading <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2727591/out-of-memory-when-creating-a-lot-of-objects-c-sharp\">Out of memory when creating a lot of objects C#</a> , I tried the following approach. This seems to be the common <code>Skip</code>/<code>Take</code> paradigm that many people use, with the added feature of saving memory.</p>\n\n<p>Note that <code>_conn</code> is created beforehand, and a temporary data context is created for each query, resulting in the associated entities being garbage collected.</p>\n\n<pre><code>int skipAmount = 0;\nbool finished = false;\n\nwhile (!finished)\n{\n    // Trick to allow for automatic garbage collection while iterating through the DB\n    using (var tempDataContext = new MyDataContext(_conn) {CommandTimeout = 600})\n    {               \n        var query =\n            (from record in tempDataContext.someTable\n             where [index is appropriate]\n             select record);\n\n        List&lt;workerLog&gt; logs = query.Skip(skipAmount).Take(BatchSize).ToList();\n        if (logs.Count == 0)\n        {\n            finished = true;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        foreach( linqEntity l in logs )\n        {\n            // Do stuff with data from l\n        }\n\n        skipAmount += logs.Count;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I have the desired behavior that memory usage doesn't increase at all as I am streaming through the data. Yet, I have a far worse problem: each <code>Skip</code> is causing the data to load more and more slowly as the underlying query seems to actually cause the server to go through all the data for all previous pages. While running the query each page takes longer and longer to load, and I can tell that this is turning into a quadratic operation. This problem has appeared in the following posts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5261717/linq-skip-problem\">LINQ Skip() Problem</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8202907/linq2sql-select-orders-and-skip-take\">LINQ2SQL select orders and skip/take</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can't seem to find a way to do this with LINQ that allows me to have limited memory use by paging data, and yet still have each page load in constant time. Is there a way to do this properly? <strong>My hunch is that there might be some way to tell the DataContext to explicitly forget about the object in the first approach above, but I can't find out how to do that.</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","database","tsql"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":94,"score":5,"question_id":12958536,"title":"T-SQL ORDER BY according to a condition","body":"<p>I am writing some sort of resources management system.</p>\n\n<p>A resource is an instance of a definition.

Data pairs are in the form:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>parameter = value</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and are related to a container. It's similar to a INI file. For example, I have a container that have these values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p1 = 32\np2 = \"hello world\"\np3 = -54\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and another one that have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p1 = 32\np2 = 36\np5 = 42\np6 = \"bye\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is an undefined number of parameters per container. The values are numbers or strings of any length (numbers can be converted to strings). Data retrieval is made by parameter name (<em>\"all p1 values\"</em>) or value (<em>\"a 'p6' parameter with the value 'bye'\"</em>). The database will contain milions of pairs. Inserts and reads will be made very often and will be rare to delete or update a record.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt has been make two tables. First one like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `container` (\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  OTHER CONTAINER INFO\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>id</code> will be used in another table that contains the pairs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `data` (\n  `container` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `name` varchar(64) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\n  `value` text COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\n  KEY `container` (`container`),\n  KEY `name` (`name`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Adding the data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO `container` (`id`) VALUES ('1'), ('2');\nINSERT INTO  `data` (`container`, `name`, `value`) VALUES \n     ('1',  'p1',  '32'), \n     ('1',  'p2',  'hello world'), \n     ('1',  'p3',  '-54'), \n     ('2',  'p1',  '32'), \n     ('2',  'p2',  '36'), \n     ('2',  'p5',  '42'), \n     ('2',  'p6',  'bye');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It works, but it's not very \"usable\" and fast. For instance, if I need to find all parameters from each container that has a <code>p1=32</code> I have to make two SQL queries, first:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT id FROM  `container` WHERE id IN (\n   SELECT container\n   FROM DATA WHERE name =  'p1'\n  AND value =  '32')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then for each container <code>id</code> get all data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM  `data` WHERE container = '$id'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then make a post-processing via PHP because it returns a table like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>container   name    value\n    1       p1      32\n    1       p2      hello world\n    1       p3      -54\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(post-processing is just a couple of calls to array_* functions, but it makes slower the processing).</p>\n\n<p>I've been testing with a database that contains 50000 data pairs and listing all the records using this procedure takes more than 5 seconds.

I once read something about i but i cannot remember it?! (e.g. table: user or users)</p>\n\n<p>The second question is a little mor specific to the project:</p>\n\n<p>The users can login into the website an have to choose 10 elements out of a list and attach each of the elements a priority from 1 to 4. My first try was to save the choice of the user in a single row as a CSV (e.g. 1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8;9,10 which represents the choice of element 1,2,3 with priority 1 etc.). The second attempt was to save each choice as a single entry like: [user_id]|[choosen_element]|[choosen_priority]. What do you think is the better variant or is there a even better one that i havent thought of?</p>\n\n<p>The third question is more about the login and rights management:</p>\n\n<p>The elements that the users can choose from are in groups.

In the future I'd like to also support XMP and IPTC metadata, but at the moment my focus is on EXIF.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few questions on Stack Overflow about what the table structure should look like when storing EXIF metadata. However, none of them really address my concern. The problem I have is that different EXIF tags have values in different formats, and there isn't really one column type which conveniently stores them all.  </p>\n\n<p>The most common type is a \"rational\" which is an array of two four-byte integers representing a fraction. But there are also non-fractional short and long integers, ASCII strings, byte arrays, and \"undefined\" (an 8-bit type which must be interpreted according to a priori knowledge of the specific tag.)  I'd like to support all of these types, and I want to do so in a convenient, efficient, lossless (i.e. without converting the rationals to floats), extensible and searchable manner.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I've considered so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>My current solution is to store everything as a string. This makes it pretty easy to store all of the different types, and is also convenient for searching and debugging. However, it's kind of clunky and inefficient because when I want to actually use the data, I have to do a bunch of string manipulation to convert the rational values into their fractional equivalents, e.g. <code>fraction = float(value.split('/')[0]) / float(value.split('/')[1])</code>.  (It's not actually a messy one-liner like that in my real code, but this demonstrates the problem.)</p></li>\n<li><p>I could grab the raw EXIF bytes for each value from the file and store them in a blob column, but then I'd have to reinterpret the raw bytes every time.  This could be marginally more CPU-efficient than the string solution, but it's much, much worse in every other way - on the whole, not worth it.</p></li>\n<li><p>I could have a different table for each different EXIF datatype. Using <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1730665/how-to-emulate-tagged-union-in-a-database\">this pattern</a> I can maintain my foreign key relationships while storing my values in several different tables.  However, this will make my most common query, which is to select all EXIF metadata for a given photo, kind of nasty.  It will also become unwieldy very quickly when I add support for other metadata formats.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not a database expert by any means, so there some pattern or magic union-style column type I'm missing that can make this problem go away? Or am I stuck picking my poison from among the three options above?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","database"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12947469,"title":"Can I run different versions of mysql on windows 7","body":"<p>I have windows 7 machine with 8GP RAM.

First of all if i do <code>$this-&gt;Article-&gt;verify()</code> I get errors for almost every record:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array\n(\n[0] =&gt; Array\n    (\n        [0] =&gt; index\n        [1] =&gt; 1\n        [2] =&gt; missing\n    )\n\n[1] =&gt; Array\n    (\n        [0] =&gt; index\n        [1] =&gt; 2\n        [2] =&gt; missing\n    )\n\n[2] =&gt; Array\n    (\n        [0] =&gt; index\n        [1] =&gt; 3\n        [2] =&gt; missing\n    )\n ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't find any difference between the records that has error and those that does not have</p>\n\n<p>I tried <code>Recover</code> but still the same. Why am I getting these errors and what do they mean? I have checked the tree data and every field (<code>parent_id</code>, <code>lft</code>, <code>rght</code>) is correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One other issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I wold like to move the records <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> in the tree. If I set <code>scope</code> to the record <code>type</code> I move them but all the children records from other types does not move.\nMy tree is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Category\n    Category\n       Category\n       Attachment\n    Category\n       Attachment\n    Article\n       Attachment\n       Attachment\n    Article\n       Attachment\n    Attachment\n Category\n Category\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If i dont set the <code>scope</code> moving a record sometimes does not see the end of the tree and start moving between other record types. How do I set the <code>scope</code> to avoid this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have track down the possible problem and probably everything comes from using both <code>Tree</code> and <code>Translate</code> (which i did not mention) behaviours both in multiple Models using one table. So what happen: </p>\n\n<p>When saving Data for each model it also saves a record in the i18n table with the translation. And when checking with <code>verify</code> or <code>recover</code>ing the table The Tree behavior only \"sees\" the posts in the current Model, also giving the \"missing index\" because not seeing the record from the other models. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to fix this, to get it working or to look for other option?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any option to use multiple trees inside one database. So the rght,lft values will be dublicated for every model but there will be no conflict because they will not \"know\" for each other. Just to use one table and not 10+ with same structure</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","database","ubuntu","migration","centos"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":1,"question_id":12389453,"title":"Large MYSQL database migration from centos to ubuntu server","body":"<p>I need to migrate large MYSQL databases from one CentOS server to another Ubuntu server.\nMYSQL version on CentOs is 5.2.25 and MYSQL version on Ubuntu is 5.2.24.</p>\n\n<p>I performed following steps to migrate the DB:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stopped mysql services on both servers.</li>\n<li>Copied /var/lib/mysql/DATABASE_NAME folder to another server /var/lib/mysql/DATABASE_NAME</li>\n<li>Started mysql services on both servers again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Database was created on new server, but no data was there.

That is, given that you have something like: one table <strong>Client</strong>, and another <strong>Broker</strong>, since a broker can have many clients and a client can have many brokers, what do you name the join (aka crossref aka M-to-M) table between these? The most common answer seems to be <strong>Client_Broker</strong> or something to that effect. </p>\n\n<p>But, what if the many to many table has additional columns apart from Id columns. For example a <strong>ValidFrom</strong> and a <strong>ValidTo</strong> for the relationship between a client and broker, and possibly many other properties qualifying the relationship. In my mind this makes the table represent more than a join, and each row is rather an entity in it's own right. Should you come up with a new noun for the table name instead, or are you still thinking it should be called Client_Broker? It will certainly look weird to perpetuate that into the object model right?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nCouldn't come up with a good noun suggestion for the M-M table in the example above, but if you replace the example with Persons subscribing to Magazines the obvious would be tables: <strong>Magazine</strong> and <strong>Person</strong>, and the join table between these would reasonably not be called PersonMagazine, but rather <strong>Subscription</strong>,  </p>\n\n<p>...Right?

Basically, I am developing a payment gateway client, whereby the process is that the website informs the payment server of the payment to be done, client is transferred to payment server, and once payment is done, payment server informs the website on a seperate thread that the payment was done, and redirects the client.  Now, the client can be 'received' on the website before the notification of the payment was received. Thus, I need to program the system to wait until the notification is received or 30 seconds at most.</p>\n\n<p>Once the notification is received, an <code>Order</code> entity is marked as 'Paid'.  The problem is this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Client is redirected to website before, <code>Order.Paid</code> is still <code>false</code></li>\n<li>After 1 - 5 seconds, notification is received and <code>Order</code> is marked as <code>true</code></li>\n<li>Due to Nhibernate session management, Client still sees the <code>Order.Paid</code> as <code>false</code> on the other thread. </li>\n<li>To make matters worse, sometimes the client's <code>Order</code> is then flushed on <code>End_Request</code>, and the <code>Order.Paid</code> is again reset to <code>false</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only way I tried that seems to work is that I dispose of the Nhibernate session explicitly before waiting, and then constantly create a new session until it is found as paid.  However the problem is since the original session was removed, lazy loading for any entities already loaded before hand will stop working and generate errors.</p>\n\n<p>It looks simple in my mind but yet seems to be quite complicated due to session management, any ideas how to go about it?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","database-design"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":12928480,"title":"How to design similar entities in the database","body":"<p>I have 3 entities in my system.

My project is a 32-bit VS2010 executable written in C#.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the effort has been fairly simple and successful. The only problem I'm having is in the firing of my custom event handler that should be called in response to a Scripting Error. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>Scripter</code> object exposes a <code>ScriptingError</code> event, which I have attempted to leverage thusly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//srv contains a valid server name\nScripter scrp = new Scripter(srv);\n\n//scrp_ScriptingError is my handler\nscrp.ScriptingError += new ScriptingErrorEventHandler(scrp_ScriptingError); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My handler is declared thusly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   static void scrp_ScriptingError(object sender, ScriptingErrorEventArgs e)\n   {\n       // my handler goes here, just printing e.Current.Urn to the console\n       // This is merely representative, have had other things here, but\n       // the handler never fires\n       Console.WriteLine(e.Current.Value);\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All this compiles cleanly.</p>\n\n<p>My code is invoked via simple <code>scrp.Script(urns);</code> where <code>urns</code> is just an array of the database objects being scripted out. Nothing fancy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    try\n    {\n        sc = scripter.Script(urns);\n    }\n    catch (Exception e)\n    {\n        WriteLog(String.Format(\"Failure during scripting: {0}: Inner exception message (if any): {1}\",e.Message,((e.InnerException==null)?\"[None]\":e.InnerException.Message)));\n    }\n    using (System.IO.StreamWriter file = new System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName,true))\n    {\n        foreach(String currentLine in sc)\n        {\n            file.WriteLine(currentLine);\n            file.WriteLine(\"GO\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that, no matter what I've tried so far, when errors occur during scripting, my ScriptingError handler never fires. </p>\n\n<p>Even in debug mode within VS2010, when I set a breakpoint within the handler, and fire my scripting code, and know an error will occur, only an exception will be thrown, but the breakpoint in my ScriptingError handler never trips. </p>\n\n<p>I'm in trees-for-forest mode now, not sure what I've done wrong. Am I expecting the wrong things for the ScriptingError handler? </p>\n\n<p>I have searched the MSDN docs on the SMO objects and found virtually nothing on ScriptingError handlers other than the basic API calls themselves, and precious few examples on the Internet. It seems incredibly simple and straightforward to me - just assigning an event handler to the event - but there's some battery-not-included notice I've failed to note.</p>\n\n<p>Pointers to my error are greatly appreciated, with a polite request for minimal brickbats if the error is exceptionally stupid on my part :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","ruby-on-rails","database","heroku"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":125,"score":0,"question_id":9379676,"title":"Rails app crashes when connecting remotely to MySQL Database on Heroku","body":"<p>We are running a Ruby on Rails on Heroku.

The files are stored on a file server and I have set up an Apache HTTP server with PHP scripts to process (i.e. upload and download) the files.  The database only stores a link to the file and not the file itself.  My question is this: How should I organize the files on my file server?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am creating a directory structure based on the current date and I rename the files with an MD5 hash of the current date/time (including milliseconds) plus some random characters (i.e. I'm adding \"salt\"):</p>\n\n<pre><code>\\\\yyyy\\mm\\dd\\debb40da158040e4f3b93f9576840c07\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This (above) is the link that is stored in the database (of course, I also store the real file name in the database so that I can rename the file when the user goes to download it---the user never sees the actual link).</p>\n\n<p>I use <code>yyyy\\mm\\dd</code> for the directory structure to avoid performance issues (I'm told that a lot of files in the same directory can slow things down) and I rename the files with a unique string to avoid clashes when users upload files with the same name.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to get other opinions on the best way to deal with storing files in this kind of situation.  I've seen some developers keep the file name, but append (as a prefix) the database ID of the corresponding row in the file information table---I see some advantages to this approach since the file names are \"human readable\" and you can figure out what the files are if the database file information table ever got corrupted or deleted.</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","wordpress"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":12882288,"title":"Wordpress taking too long to post until timeout","body":"<p>I have a wordpress blog with about 33000 posts and the database is about 2.2gb.

This also feels like a good way to make sure that the user can only have a role as current, if he has access to the role... Only, I also see potential disaster here:\nWhat if, the FK in the persons table references that relationship of another user. The DB design would allow this. It would only be code that prevents it.</p>\n\n<p>2: (See bottom part of image linked below)</p>\n\n<p>I keep the associative entity simple, and instead I have FK in persons table that points to a specific role in the Roles table.</p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that I get even less help from the DB design with ensuring that the \"current role\" of a person, is a role that is actually \"allowed\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/bBbka.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Example image</a></p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated =)</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I'll include another variation of the same issue.</p>\n\n<p>Two entities: WorkOrders and Sites</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 Site may have access to many Work orders</li>\n<li>1 WorkOrder may be accessed by many Sites</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So we have a many-to-many relationship</p>\n\n<p>The issue: How do we best store in database which Site is the Owner of a work order, when there can only be 1 Site that Owns a work order.</p>\n\n<p>Do we have \"OwnerSiteId\" as a column in the WorkOrder table, or would it be ok to reference the many-to-many relationship instead, saying \"that one\" is the owner.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","database","authentication","normalization"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":1,"question_id":12894101,"title":"Designing a database where each user has her own salt","body":"<p>I'd like to build an authentication system, where each user has her own salt - each password gets hashed with the salt of the user it belongs to.</p>\n\n<p>How should I design the database schema?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a design I came up with, but I'm not sure about it, as <code>hash</code> depends on <code>salt</code> and this violates <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form\" rel=\"nofollow\">third normal form</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>users(id, salt, hash, ...)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["database","ibm","mainframe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12823903,"title":"Connect to IMS with Open Database from .Net application or using JDBC ..?","body":"<p>I am looking to find if there are special drivers I have to use in order to connect a .NET application to IMS.<br>\nOn the Internet, I found articles saying that something called Open Database, provides JDBC and that it is one way to go.

Just to make sure everyone is on the same page these are the credentials I'm talking about...</p>\n\n<pre><code>$user = 'user';// not actual user, not root either\n$pass = 'pass';// not actual password\n$server = 'localhost';\n$database = mysql_connect($server,$user,$pass,true|false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I'm talking about the passwords used to <em>connect</em> to the database, not the passwords in the database (which for clarification I have hashed with salt and pepper).</p>\n\n<p>I have not read anything that I think remotely suggests you can have 100% foolproof security since obviously the server needs to connect to the database and get the content for visitors 24/7; if I am mistaken I would love to hear how this would be possible.</p>\n\n<p>So let's presume a hacker has root access (or if that does not imply access to the PHP code let's just say then have access to all the PHP source code) and they (in this circumstance) desire to access/modify/etc databases. If we can not prevent them should they have access to the PHP source then we want to slow them down as much as possible. I can keep each site/database connection password in separate files (can as in I'm a few weeks from finishing multi-domain support) for each site and not inside of public_html (obviously). I use serialize and unserialize to store certain variables to ensure certain level of fault tolerance for when the database becomes unavailable on shared hosting (preventing site A from looking and acting like site B and vice-versa) as the database can sometimes become unavailable numerous times a day (my database error logs are written to when the SQL service becomes available again and catches these \"away\" errors). One thought that has crossed my mind is determining a way to store the passwords in one hash and un-hashing them to be used to connect to the database by PHP though I'd like some opinions about this as well please.</p>\n\n<p>If someone has a suggestion from the database perspective (e.g. having the ability to restrict users to SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, etc and not allowing DROP and TRUNCATE as examples) my primary concern is making sure I am SQL neutral as I plan to eventually migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL (this may or may not be relevant though if it is better to mention it). I currently use phpMyAdmin and cPanel and phpMyAdmin shows the connected user is not the same as the site's database user names so in that regard I can still use certain commands (DROP and TRUNCATE as examples again) with that user and restrict the SITE user permissions unless I am mistaken for some reason?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to configure the context of where the connection credentials are accepted? For clarification a hacker with access to the source code would not be accessing the site the same way legitimate users would.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that crossed my mind is system based encryption, is there a near-universal (as in on every or almost every LAMP web host setup) web-hosting technique where the system can read/write the file through Apache that would introduce a new layer that a hacker would have to determine a way to circumvent?</p>\n\n<p>I am using different passwords for each user of course.</p>\n\n<p>I currently am on shared hosting though hopefully my setup will scale upwards to dedicated hosting eventually.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the thoughts on my security concepts and what other concepts could I try out to make my database connection credentials more secure?</p>\n\n<p>Clarification: I am looking for ideas that I can pursue. If there is disagreement with any of the suggestions please ask for clarification and explain your concern in place of debating a given approach as I may or may not have even considered let alone begun to pursue a given concept.

This is NOT a database structure question or anything like that. This is a question on how to store a multilingual website: NOT how to store translations. A multilingual website can not only be translated into multiple languages, but also can have language-specific content. For instance an english version of the website can have a completely different structure than the same website in russian or any other language. I've thought up of 2 storage schemas for such cases:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// NUMBER ONE\n\ntable contents // to store some HYPOTHETICAL content\n    id         // content id\n\ntable contents_loc // to translate the content\n    content, // ID of content to translate \n    lang,    // language to translate to\n    value,   // translated content\n    online   // availability flag, VERY IMPORTANT\n\nADVANTAGES:\n- Content can be stored in multiple languages. This schema is pretty common, except maybe for the \"online\" flag in the \"_loc\" tables. About that below.\n- Every content can not only be translated into multiple languages, but also you could mark online=false for a single language and disable the content from appearing in that language. Alternatively, that record could be removed from \"_loc\" table to achieve the same functionality as online=false, but this time it would be permanent and couldn't be easily undone. For instance we could create some sort of a menu, but we don't want one or more items to appear in english - so we use online=false on those \"translations\".\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\n- Quickly gets pretty ugly with more complex table relations.\n- More difficult queries.\n\n\n\n// NUMBER 2\n\ntable contents // to store some HYPOTHETICAL content\n    id,        // content id\n    online     // content availability (not the same as in first example)\n    lang,      // language of the content\n    value,     // translated content\n\nADVANTAGES:\n1. Less painful to implement\n2. Shorter queries\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\n2. Every multilingual record would now have 3 different IDs. It would be bad for eg. products in an e-shop, since the first version would allow us to store different languages under the same ID and this one would require 3 separate records to represent the same product.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First storage option would seem like a great solution, since you could easily use it instead of the second one as well, but you couldn't easily do it the other way around.\nThe only problem is ... the first structure seems a bit like an overkill (except in cases like product storage)</p>\n\n<p>So my question to you is:</p>\n\n<p>Is it logical to implement the first storage option? In your experience, would anyone ever need such a solution? </p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","database","unit-testing","transactions"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":257,"score":2,"question_id":6258187,"title":"Using TransactionScope does not reseed identity column","body":"<p>I've started using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.transactionscope.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">TransactionScope</a> to help with my unit tests, in order to put my test database back to it's previous state.
