I am programming a microcontroller and have some global variables, which as per some advice I read on here are all defined in a \"global_variables.h\" file which is included anywhere that the global variables are used.</p>\n\n<p>I also put the typedef for the global variables into the \"global_variables.h\" file.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I am running across is that the file1.c in which I use the global variable has a function1(new_type_t variable) which accepts the new typedef as a parameter. The problem with this is that I have the function1 prototype defined in the header (file1.h), but since the #include \"global_variables.h\" is located in file1.c, the function prototype in file1.h does not see the typedef.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like this is a common occurrence, but Googling didn't seem to provide too much help. Should I make a separate \"global_variables.h\" and \"global_variables_types.h\" and include the .h file in the headers of my other files and the .c in the sources?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","linux","pthreads","posix","virtual-memory"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4,"score":0,"question_id":13298582,"title":"Overriding clone parameters used by pthreads","body":"<p>I'm using pthreads and I would like to spawn threads (using pthread_create) that DO NOT have the CLONE_VM flag set on clone().

The program takes a snapshot of the current processes, enumerates the process tree, and injects a DLL into its direct parent process. Now, under ideal conditions, that works fine: the 32-bit version of the injector can inject into 32-bit parent processes, and the 64-bit version of the injector can inject into the 64-bit parent processes.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm now looking to do, though, is to inject a 32-bit DLL into 32-bit parent process from the x64 injector. Once that DLL is injected, I was hoping to then inject a call to one of the functions exported by the injected DLL. I'm not sure, though, if that's actually possible to do. (I've already put together some code to identify whether the parent process is a 32-bit process or a 64-bit process, so that won't be an issue)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I've already found some code that seems to do the first part by <a href=\"https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/blob/master/ansicon.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">injecting precompiled machine code into the process</a>. (At least, I think that's what it's doing) Normally, after injecting the call to LoadLibraryW, I'd get the address returned by that call, add the relative offset to the exported function I want to call, and inject a call to that function. In this case though, I can't load the 32-bit library into my 64-bit injector, so I can't find the relative offset of the function by using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683212%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">GetProcAddress</a> like I normally would. I got past this issue by doing the following:</p>\n\n<p>Since I can't find the function offset of the 32-bit DLL using normal means, I'm currently reading the file into a buffer, using that buffer to populate a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680336%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32</a> struct, and enumerating the IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY to find the names and relative offsets of all exported functions.</p>\n\n<p>So at this point, I have the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 32-bit DLL loaded into the 32-bit Process</li>\n<li>A value that is the equivalent of funcAddr when running the following code in the 32-bit process:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Code:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>HMODULE hInjectedDLL = LoadLibrary(\"mydll.dll\");\nDWORD funcAddr = (DWORD)GetProcAddress(hInjectedDLL, \"ExportedFunc\") - (DWORD)hInjectedDLL;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Theoretically, all I need now is the value of hInjectedDLL, and I should be able to make a call to that function. Unfortunately, though, I don't really know enough about assembly or machine code to know how to go about getting that value, though.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>(Also, I'm aware that I could save myself a lot of trouble by just compiling two versions of the injector, and having one run the other when the parent process's processor architecture doesn't match up. I'm trying to avoid going this route, though.) </p>\n"},{"tags":["c","facebook-javascript-sdk"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":5,"score":-2,"question_id":13297337,"title":"I can set up a Facebook page with graph api?","body":"<p>I wonder if it is possible this programmatically, what I try to do is create multiple Facebook pages in a project without having to go to www.facebook.com</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","c++","c"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":187,"score":2,"question_id":13287430,"title":"i++ or i-- in a for loop?","body":"<p>While writing a <code>for</code> loop where both start and end conditions are known, which way is better?

The purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of\n  the result. This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions,\n  which are defined as follows:</p>\n  \n  <p>If either operand is of type long double, the other shall be converted\n  to long double.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, if either operand is double, the other shall be converted\n  to double.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, if either operand is float, the other shall be converted to\n  float.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, the integral promotions (4.5) shall be performed on both\n  operands.54)</p>\n  \n  <p>Then, if either operand is unsigned long the other shall be converted\n  to unsigned long.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, if one operand is a long int and the other unsigned int,\n  then if a long int can represent all the values of an unsigned int,\n  the unsigned int shall be converted to a long int; otherwise both\n  operands shall be converted to unsigned long int.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, if either operand is long, the other shall be converted to\n  long.</p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, if either operand is unsigned, the other shall be converted\n  to unsigned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus according to this answer,  since both operand is unsigned, the other shall be converted to unsigned, and the equality should pass. But it clearly is not passing, and as answered already in this question, they are both being promoted as signed ints. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c","linux","console","terminal"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13292987,"title":"copy text from terminal to memory","body":"<p>I know it will appear ugly, but, suppose a simple program like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(void)\n{\n   int line=0, column=1;\n   char c;\n   system(\"clear\");\n   printf(\"0123\\n4567\\n\");\n\n   getprintedchar(column, line, &amp;c);\n   printf(\"%c\", c);\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That will print number <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>How can we program such function using LINUX terminal.

Several routines of the code are easy to parallelize using OpenMP and scale very well. However, I have run into problems in a crucial part of the code that deals with interpolation from particles to a grid cells. The particles are moving around for each iteration (according to a velocity field). Many calculations are most effecient to perform on a regular, non-deforming grid. Therefore, each iteration involves communication from \"randomly\"  distributed particles to the grid cells.</p>\n\n<p>The problem can be illustrated in the following simplified 1D code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//EXPLANATION OF VARIABLES (all previously allocated and initialized, 1D arrays)\n//double *markerval; // Size Nm. Particle values. Are to be interpolated to the grid\n//double *grid; // Size Ng=Nm/100 Grid values. \n//uint *markerpos; // Size Nm. Position of particles relative to grid (each particle\n// knows what grid cell it belongs to) possible values are 0,1,...Ng-1\n\n//#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) private(e)\nfor (e=0; e&lt;Nm; e++) {\n    //#pragma omp atomic\n    grid[markerpos[e]]+=markerval[e];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The particle positions are random in the worst case scenario, but typically, particles neighboring each other in memory, also neighbor each other in space and hence also in grid memory.</p>\n\n<p>How do I parallelize this procedure efficiently? Several particles map to the same grid cell, so there is a nonzero chance of race conditions and cache swapping if the above loop is directly parallelized. Making the update atomic prevents race conditions, but makes the code much slower than the sequential case.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried to make a private copy of grid values for each thread and then add them up subsequently. This, however, probably requires too much memory in the code to be used, and for this example, it did not scale so well with the number of threads (for reasons of which I am uncertain).</p>\n\n<p>A third option might be to map from the grid to the particles and then loop through grid indices instead of particle indices. However, this, I fear, would be quite involved and require a major change of the code, and I am uncertain how much it would help, since it would also require the use of sort routines which would be computationally expensive as well.</p>\n\n<p>Has anybody got any experience with this or a similar problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","unix","shared-memory"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":13291078,"title":"UNIX Shared Memory","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13234990/unix-programming-shared-memory-strange-results\">Unix Programming Shared Memory strange results</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been doing and learning how to use shared memory for two weeks now, and in a smaller exercice i could make it work but now im having problems in the following code in relation to other sequencial code that i made ... the output just is the same and doesnt get to calculation like the sequencial version ... and the code is the same ...</p>\n\n<p>This is the shared memory code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define MAX_SIZE 20\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;

In a nutshell, I have gotten the first part working using the shared library and JNI, but the second part (which refers to the same library) gives an UnsatisfiedLinkError every time I try to run the code. My professor and TAs are all unable to figure out this problem and I have been trying to debug it for over a week now.</p>\n\n<p>The first part is a .java program that will be executed independently, given a file of integers and a frequency, it should call native code in C to compute a direct fourier transform and return a value given a frequency. In java, I stored these ints into an array and passed the array to JNI to compute the DFT in C. This returns a single int value and works like a charm.</p>\n\n<p>For the second part, we have created a gui interface which loads the JNI library and takes in a .wav file or a file of our own format. This gui is required to calculate the frequency of a file when selected from a file chooser. Since the .wav files (and the other type) have header information as well as binary data, rather than integer numbers as in the first part, my strategy is to pass the filename (as a string) to JNI so that my native code can dissect the int values into an array itself and then calculate the frequency of the file. My gui is complete, and the action event of selecting a file from the chooser is supposed to call the JNI code and return the frequency of the file. Interestingly, <em>the code compiles in linux and loads the library successfully</em>, but crashes with this link error <em>when the file is chosen and the native code is supposed to be called</em> using the file chooser. I am at a complete and total frustrated defeat.

All local variables, if needed should only be accessed through get/set functions.</p>\n\n<p>That implies that if we need to fully write out all these parameters that these each should get their own get/set functions for altering them throughout the application.</p>\n\n<p>On of the solutions that I've thought on was the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifdef EITHER\nenum\n{\n    eventLogVar1 = 0; /* 00 */\n    pad01;            /* 01 */\n    eventLogVar2;     /* 02 */\n    pad03;            /* 03 */\n    pad04;            /* 04 */\n    pad05;            /* 05 */\n    eventLogVar3;     /* 06 */\n    eventLogVar4;     /* 07 */\n    eventLogVar5;     /* 08 */\n    pad09;            /* 09 */\n    pad10;            /* 10 */\n    pad11;            /* 11 */\n}\n#else /* OR */\n#define eventLogVar1 0 /* 2 bytes */\n#define eventLogVar2 2 /* 4 bytes */\n#define eventLogVar3 6 /* 1 byte  */\n#define eventLogVar4 7 /* 1 byte  */\n#define eventLogVar5 8 /* 4 bytes */\n#endif\n#define eventLogLastLength 4\n\nU8BIT eventLog[eventLogVar5 + eventLogLastLength];\n\nU8BIT getU8BIT(U8BIT index){}\nU16BIT getU16BIT(U8BIT index){}\nU32BIT getU32BIT(U8BIT index){}\n\nvoid setU8BIT(U8BIT index, U8BIT val){}  \nvoid setU16BIT(U8BIT index, U16BIT val){}\nvoid setU32BIT(U8BIT index, U32BIT val){}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this poses a combersome refactoring if values are added or removed. It also means that values of type array can not be used (and there are a few) which can be altered by defines in length if more or less of a certain type of, e.g., sensors, are used.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on this specific problem. Would I/we be better off documenting our deviation from the MISRA-standard in this specific case and only use this deviation at this specific place or are there better solutions to this problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","gcc","amd","xop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13284225,"title":"AMD xop check support","body":"<p>I have next problem:<br>\nI have some tests related to xop check with using some <code>Bulldozer (xop)</code> instructions.<br>\nAnd I must run this tests only on <code>Bulldozer</code> processors.<br>\nHow can I check that my processor supports <code>xop</code> instruction at compile-time?    </p>\n\n<p><em>Language:</em> <code>C</code>, <em>Os:</em> <code>Linux</code>;</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","pointers","struct","memcpy"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":1,"question_id":13284033,"title":"Copying structure in C with assignment instead of memcpy()","body":"<p>Up until recently, I have only seen copying of structure fields done with <code>memcpy()</code>.

Morris. I had to ask same question on CodeReview and he gave me some instructions to make my code clearer.</p>\n\n<p>I divided my function into functions and also stopped using recursion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Firstly</em>, I created a add_to_q function which adds value to related queue and it helped to get rid of code duplication. By the way James Khoury's way is simplest one but it again uses recursion.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void add_to_q(queue_t *queue_arr[], int value, int pos) {\nif(queue_arr[pos]-&gt;size == 0){\n    queue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp = (queue_node_t *)malloc (sizeof(queue_node_t));\n    queue_arr[pos]-&gt;frontp = queue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp;\n} else {\n    queue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp-&gt;restp = (queue_node_t *)malloc(sizeof(queue_node_t));\n    queue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp = queue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp-&gt;restp;\n}\nqueue_arr[pos]-&gt;rearp-&gt;element = value;\nqueue_arr[pos]-&gt;size++;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Secondly</em> I created other helper functions. One is add_to_eleventh which simply adds all queue elements to the eleventh queue's rear. In my opinion, it is doing what question wants.</p>\n\n<pre><code>queue_t * add_to_eleventh(queue_t *queue[]) {\nint i;\nfor(i=0;i&lt;=9;i++){\n    while(queue[i]-&gt;frontp != NULL){\n        if(queue[10]-&gt;size == 0){\n            queue[10]-&gt;rearp = (queue_node_t *)malloc (sizeof(queue_node_t));\n            queue[10]-&gt;frontp = queue[10]-&gt;rearp;\n        } else {\n            queue[10]-&gt;rearp-&gt;restp = (queue_node_t *)malloc(sizeof(queue_node_t));\n            queue[10]-&gt;rearp = queue[10]-&gt;rearp-&gt;restp;\n        }\n        if ( queue[i]-&gt;size != 0 ){\n            queue[10]-&gt;rearp-&gt;element = queue[i]-&gt;frontp-&gt;element;\n            printf(\"---%d***\",queue[i]-&gt;frontp-&gt;element);\n        }\n        queue[10]-&gt;size+=1;\n        queue[i]-&gt;frontp = queue[i]-&gt;frontp-&gt;restp;\n        queue[10]-&gt;rearp-&gt;restp = NULL;\n    }\n}\nreturn queue[10];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Thirdly</em>, my last helper function is back_to_ints. Its purpose is take the elements in 11th queue and divide them by ten and return them in a integer array.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void back_to_ints(queue_t *arr[], int *new_arr) {\nqueue_node_t *cur_nodep;\ncur_nodep = arr[10]-&gt;frontp;\nint i = 0, digit;\nwhile(cur_nodep != NULL){\n    cur_nodep-&gt;element/=10;\n    digit = cur_nodep-&gt;element / 10;\n    new_arr[i++] = digit;\n    cur_nodep = cur_nodep-&gt;restp;\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Finally</em> my new sorting function which is now sorts the integers in same digit. Such that, numbers[7] = {112,133,122,334,345,447,346}; </p>\n\n<pre><code>queue_t * radix_sort(int *arr, const int size,queue_t *sorted_arr[]) {\nint i, digit[size], initials[size],j;\nfor(i=0;i&lt;size;i++)\n    initials[i] = arr[i];\ni = 0;\nwhile(initials[i] != 0){\n    j = i;\n    printf(\"initialssss%d\", initials[--j]);\n    back_to_ints(sorted_arr, initials);\n\n    for(i=0;i&lt;size;i++){\n    digit[i] = initials[i] % 10;\n\n    switch (digit[i]) {\n    case 0:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 0);\n        break;\n    case 1:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 1);\n        break;\n    case 2:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 2);\n        break;\n    case 3:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 3);\n        break;\n    case 4:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 4);\n        break;\n    case 5:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 5);\n        break;\n    case 6:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 6);\n        break;\n    case 7:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 7);\n        break;\n    case 8:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 8);\n        break;\n    case 9:\n        add_to_q(sorted_arr, arr[i], 9);\n        break;\n        }\n    }\n    sorted_arr[10] = add_to_eleventh(sorted_arr);\n    i++;\n}\nreturn sorted_arr[10];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I solved the question partially. If you want to sort the numbers in same digit, it works. Otherwise, it fails. For instance, your inputs are 112,133,122,334,345,447,346 then the result will be <strong>112  122 133 334 345 346 447</strong>. But, if the user wants to sort something like that(111,13,12,334,345,447,1) it gives <strong>111   1   12  13  334 345 447</strong>. So, how can I overcome this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I have changed my header file a bit.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef RADIX_H_\n#define RADIX_H_\n\ntypedef struct queue_node_s {\n    int element;\n    struct queue_node_s *restp;\n}queue_node_t;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    queue_node_t *frontp,\n             *rearp;\n    int size;\n}queue_t;\n\nqueue_t * radix_sort(int *arr,const int size, queue_t *sorted_arr[]);\nvoid add_to_q(queue_t *queue_arr[], int value, int pos);\nqueue_t * add_to_eleventh(queue_t *queue[]);\nvoid back_to_ints(queue_t *arr[], int *new_arr);\nvoid displayRadixed(queue_t *sorted[]);\n#endif /* RADIX_H_ */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you for reopening my thread...</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","network-programming","ip"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":4,"question_id":13281974,"title":"How to get local network IP address of a remote computer","body":"<p>A remote computer has two address: <strong>LAN</strong> and <strong>VPN</strong></p>\n\n<p>I tried to get <strong>LAN</strong> IP address by following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>hostent *host = gethostbyname(hostname);\nif (host) strcpy(ip, inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)host-&gt;h_addr)));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, sometime it return <strong>LAN</strong>, but sometime <strong>VPN</strong>.

The SDK has, for some hideously frustrating reason, recompiled a subset of that same third-party library into their own (renamed) lib, although the symbols themselves are named the same and they are not encapsulated within a namespace.  My application itself depends upon the same third-party library.</p>\n\n<p>I've considered a few options, but maybe I'm missing something and hopefully a fresh look will help me out.  Perhaps I'm close and someone will know the next step for one of these . I'll enumerate what I've tried and the shortcomings of each solution so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Link with both.\nI get about 2500 lines of symbol redefinition / size change warnings and errors.  This is when I first found that they defined the same symbols.  I'm trying to recompile OpenSSL with g++ and drop it into a namespace at the moment...see edit below...</p></li>\n<li><p>Link with the SDK only.\nI get undefined symbols that my own code depends upon - this is when I found that their recompile of the third party lib is a subset, or at least was configured with one module disabled.</p></li>\n<li><p>Link with the third party lib only.\nI have a couple of undefined symbols reported by the SDK - one of them is actually a #define in a header file within the third party lib, so all references in the third party lib resolve to the definition, but references outside there do not.  I moved that into the c file, which resolves that, however I still have two unresolved functions I can't find anywhere.  This is the closest I've gotten so far.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strip conflicting symbols from one lib and link in both.\nSo far this hasn't worked.  It could be a version issue between the lib statically linked in the SDK and the versions I've tried using of the third-party lib, but it looks like some functions were moved between symbols, so by removing a symbol, I inadvertently remove a function that I need elsewhere.  There doesn't seem to be a perfect mapping between functions in symbols in the SDK vs functions in symbols in the third-party lib.  Is it plausible to strip functions without having to manually adjust addresses?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've been examining symbols in libs with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nm -C --defined-only lib&lt;name&gt;.a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And extracting entire objects with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ar -x lib&lt;name&gt;.a &lt;objname&gt;.o\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hopefully this will also help others who have had to link with third-party libs that conflict with one another.  For the sake of specifics, the third-party lib is <a href=\"http://www.openssl.org/\">OpenSSL</a>, and the SDK is <a href=\"http://www.opsec.com/cp_products/opsec_sdk.html\">Opsec</a> - libcpopenssl.a is the offending lib in Opsec.</p>\n\n<p>**EDIT- A late entry possible workaround may be to recompile OpenSSL with g++ and put the whole thing in a namespace, and then link both libs.

The code causing the exception was the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void fill_number(array_info* array,  int value,  int x1,  int y1,  int x2,  int y2)//fills a rectangular part of the array with `value`\n    {\n    int i, j;\n    for(i=y1 ; ((i&lt;=y2)&amp;&amp;(i&lt;array-&gt;height)) ; i++)//start seeding the values by row (as in vertically)\n    {\n        for(j=x1 ; ((i&lt;=x2)&amp;&amp;(i&lt;array-&gt;width)) ; j++)//seed the values by columns (as in horizontally)\n        {\n        array-&gt;dat_ptr[i][j]=value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And <code>((i&lt;=x2)&amp;&amp;(i&lt;=array-&gt;width))</code> wasn't being evaluated as I expected (Chris Dodd, you were right). I thought that it would evaluate both conditions in that order or stop if either was \"FALSE\", independent of their order. However, it turned out it didn't work that way and it was simply refusing to evaluate the <code>(i&lt;array-&gt;width)</code> part correctly. Also, I assumed that it would trigger an exception upon trying to access memory outside of the array range, but it didn't. Anyway,</p>\n\n<p>I changed the code to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void fill_number(array_info* array,  int value,  int x1,  int y1,\n                                                    int x2,  int y2)\n{\n    int i, j;\n    if(y1&gt;=array-&gt;height){ y1=array-&gt;height-1;}\n    if(y2&gt;=array-&gt;height){ y1=array-&gt;height-1;}\n    if(x1&gt;=array-&gt;width) { x2=array-&gt;width-1;}\n    if(x2&gt;=array-&gt;width) { x2=array-&gt;width-1;}\n    for(i=y1 ; i&lt;=y2 ; i++)//start seeding the values by row\n    {\n        for(j=x1 ; j&lt;=x2 ; j++)//seed the values by column\n        {\n        array-&gt;dat_ptr[i][j]=value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now it works. The block of <code>if()</code>s is there because I won't be calling the function very often compared to the rest of the code and I need a visual way to remind me that the check is there.</p>\n\n<p>Again, thank you so much Jonathan Leffler, Chris Dodd, and rharrison33 :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","hex"],"answer_count":14,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57534,"score":6,"question_id":10324,"title":"How can I convert a hexadecimal number to base 10 efficiently in C?","body":"<p>In C what is the most efficient way to convert a hexadecimal value to its base 10 value?</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I have FFFFFFFE the result would be 4294967294.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","struct"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":2,"question_id":13238913,"title":"Setting a struct equal to a value","body":"<p>Let's say I have a <code>struct</code> with a field <code>x</code> that is also a <code>struct</code> (not a pointer to a <code>struct</code>).</p>\n\n<p>If I say <code>object.x = 0</code>, what is actually happening under the hood?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","kdevelop"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3918,"score":0,"question_id":5036809,"title":"Kdevelop-How to create a C project?","body":"<p>im using Kdevelop to create C++ projects...

Your program should measure the number of page faults generated by each strategy. \nYour simulator should read a reference string from a file. The reference string items will be of the form:  , where PID is a process ID and page ref is a page of that process' memory. For example, the following might be the beginning of an input file: </p>\n\n<pre><code>1 45\n1 46\n1 45\n1 44\n1 45\n2 76\n2 75\n2 77\n2 77\n2 76\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This reference string corresponds to Process 1 accessing its pages 45, 46, 45, 44, and 45, then Process 2 accessing its pages 76, 77, 77, 76, and 75. We will assume a pure demand paging system (no pre-fetching). The simulation also should allow the number of physical frames to be specified. So for example, if there are 3 or more frames available, the above reference string will cause 6 page faults for all three strategies (one for each time a new page is referenced). If there are only 2 frames available, then there would be 7 page faults for LRU and 8 page faults for FIFO</p>\n\n<p>My problem is i am not sure how to tackle this in code. Can i use 2 arrays or in C++ vectors? And how do i know if it page faults? Do i copy one array into another and if a slot is empty thats a page fault? Do i load the file into an array? I want to keep it as simple as possible with no hashtables, or link list since it will take me longer to implement.</p>\n\n<p>I understand theres 3 different strategies. So, i am fine with doing just FIFO for now. I know theres a lot of questions asked but you can see im completely lost.

Let me propose a simple scenario. Assume I have main and a module which has some hardware specific code. This code could be for controlling a specific motor in a system or a sensor... any bit of hardware with a defined role. Within module.c I have a function called <code>ModuleNameTask</code>. In <code>main</code> I create the task using <code>xTaskCreate</code> and I pass <code>ModuleNameTask</code>. Since my <code>ModuleNameTask</code> is defined in module.c and not main.c, I now have to include bits of FreeRTOS within module.c in order to use functions like <code>vTaskDelay</code>. I don't like the fact that I am including these files within module.c as I feel its no longer portable.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do I handle this?

After trying it on the iPad 3 today I found out that I was only getting 2fps.  This was WAAAY too slow.

I'm seriously shocked at how awful the performance is given everyone says UIKit renders using OpenGLES.</p>\n\n<p>So I converted the rendering code to GLES1 (I can't be bothered to set up a GLES2 renderer at the mo ;)).

How do i print out the memory addresses of the doubles (all of them are of value 0.0) correctly?</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* correct solution, with correct formatting */\n\n\n/*The total number of bytes allocated was:  4\n0x7fd5e1c038c0 - 1\n 0x7fd5e1c038c8 - 2\n 0x7fd5e1c038d0 - 3\n 0x7fd5e1c038d8 - 4*/\n\n double **dmatrix(size_t m, size_t n);\n\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[])\n{\n    int m,n,i;\n    double ** f;\n    m = n = 2;  \n    i = 0;\n\n    f = dmatrix(sizeof(m), sizeof(n));\n\n    printf(\"%s %d\\n\", \"The total number of bytes allocated was: \", m * n);\n    for (i=0;i&lt;n*m;++i) {\n        printf(\"%p - %d\\n \", &amp;f[i], i + 1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\ndouble **dmatrix(size_t m, size_t n) {\n\n    double ** ptr1 = (double **)malloc(sizeof(double *) * m * n);\n    double * ptr2 = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * m);\n\n    int i;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++){\n        ptr1[i] = ptr2+m*i;\n    }\n\n\n    return ptr1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c","pointers","realloc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13213992,"title":"Pointers getting junk values outside of functions, but regular values inside them","body":"<p>Full disclosure: This is my first time doing any significant programming in C, and my first post on Stack Overflow.</p>\n\n<p>I'm working on code that will eventually be used with Bison to implement a small subset of the Scheme/Racket language. All of this code is in a single C file. I have three structs: <code>Binding</code>, <code>Lambda</code>, and <code>SymbolEntry</code>. I'm not using the <code>Lambda</code> struct yet, it's just there for completeness. I also have a symbol table that holds symbol entries. <code>printSymbolTable()</code> does exactly what the name implies:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef struct\n{\n    char* name;\n    char* value;\n} Binding;\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int numBindings;\n    Binding** bindings;\n    char* functionBody; \n} Lambda;\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    Binding* binding;\n    Lambda* function;\n} SymbolEntry;\n\nSymbolEntry* symbolTable = NULL;\nint numSymbols = 0;\n\nvoid printSymbolTable()\n{\n    if (symbolTable)\n    {\n        int i = 0;\n        for (i; i &lt; numSymbols; i++)\n        {\n            printf(\"\\tsymbolTable[%i]: %s = %s\\n\", i, symbolTable[i].binding-&gt;name, symbolTable[i].binding-&gt;value);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm currently trying to work out the logic for defining and looking up variables. The 2 relevant functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Takes a name and an exprssion and stores the result in the symbol table\nvoid defineVar(char* name, char* expr)\n{\n    printf(\"\\nSetting %s = %s\\n\", name, expr);\n    printf(\"Previous number of symbols: %i\\n\", numSymbols);\n    Binding props;\n    props.name = name;\n    props.value = expr;\n\n    SymbolEntry entry;\n    entry.binding = &amp;props;\n    entry.function = NULL;\n\n    symbolTable = realloc(symbolTable, sizeof(SymbolEntry) * ++numSymbols);\n    if (!symbolTable)\n    {\n        printf(\"Memory allocation failed.

I get no warnings or errors when compiling, and the program executes successfully. However, this is the result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Variable tests\n\nSetting foo = 0\nPrevious number of symbols: 0\nNew number of symbols: 1\ndefineVar result:\n    symbolTable[0]: foo = 0\nAfter returning from defineVar:\n    symbolTable[0]: 1�I��^H��H���PTI��@ = �E\n\nSetting bar = 20\nPrevious number of symbols: 1\nNew number of symbols: 2\ndefineVar result:\n    symbolTable[0]: bar = 20\n    symbolTable[1]: bar = 20\nAfter returning from defineVar:\n    symbolTable[0]: 1�I��^H��H���PTI��@ = �E\n    symbolTable[1]: 1�I��^H��H���PTI��@ = �E���\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not only am I getting junk values when outside of the <code>defineVar()</code> function, but the call to define <code>bar</code> shows incorrect non-junk values as well. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I assume it's probably something with <code>realloc()</code>. However, a similar strategy worked when parsing a string into individual tokens, so that's what I was trying to emulate.

The goal was to take in a \"depth\" \"filename\" and \"attribute\" from the command line. The file is a txt file which holds user information, the attribute is simply which information we want to  later sort by. The depth, however, is important because I need to create a binary tree, using forks, based on the number the user enters. With a depth of 1 I would have my main process, one internal node, and 2 leaf nodes. With a depth of two I would have my main process, one internal node that has two internal nodes as children, and they each have two leaf nodes as children... and so on.  </p>\n\n<p>My code currently reads in all of the information into an array of structs, creates the binary tree of the correct amount of nodes, and all of my sorting algorithms (Shell, Quick, Bubble) work. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I must implement named- pipes and pass the data down to the leaf nodes for sorting. Each internal node is supposed to split the data down to it's children. Then, once the data reaches the leaf nodes they will implement a different sorting algorithm and return the results to their parent/internal. The internal nodes will take the sorted data from it's two children and merge the results. Eventually, the data will be merged all the way back to the anchor node. </p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I cannot wrap my mind around pipes at all. I do not know how to keep track of them or initialize them at the right time. I thought about finding out how many leaf nodes should be produced by the depth given and splitting the data evenly that way, then just making an if statement to run the correct sorter on each part of the data, but that would not be solving the correct problem.

So I would have thought that if I blow locality out the window by doing random seeks and writes, both buffered and unbuffered I/O ought to have similar performance...  maybe with unbuffered coming out slightly better.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, I know it's crazy for buffered I/O to only buffer one sector, so I might also expect it to perform terribly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My application</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am storing values gathered by a SCADA device driver that receives remote telemetry for upwards of a hundred thousand points.

Each test seeds the random number generator with the same value to be fair.  First I erase the file and pad it to the total length (about 7.6 meg), then loop a few million times, passing a random file offset and some data to one of two test functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void WriteOldSchool( void *context, long offset, Data *data )\n{\n    int fd = (int)context;\n    lseek( fd, offset, SEEK_SET );\n    write( fd, (void*)data, sizeof(Data) );\n}\n\nvoid WriteStandard( void *context, long offset, Data *data )\n{\n    FILE *fp = (FILE*)context;\n    fseek( fp, offset, SEEK_SET );\n    fwrite( (void*)data, sizeof(Data), 1, fp );\n    fflush(fp);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Maybe no surprises?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <code>OldSchool</code> method came out on top - by a lot.  It was over 6 times faster (1.48 million versus 232000 records per second).  To make sure I hadn't run into hardware caching, I expanded my database size to 20 million records (file size of 763 meg) and got the same results.</p>\n\n<p>Before you point out the obvious call to <code>fflush</code>, let me say that removing it had no effect.  I imagine this is because the cache must be committed when I seek sufficiently far away, which is what I'm doing most of the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, what's going on?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the buffered I/O must be reading (and possibly writing all of) a large chunk of the file whenever I try to write.  Because I am hardly ever taking advantage of its cache, this is extremely wasteful.</p>\n\n<p>In addition (and I don't know the details of hardware caching on disk), if the buffered I/O is trying to write a bunch of sectors when I change only one, that would reduce the effectiveness of the hardware cache.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any disk experts out there who can comment and explain this better than my experimental findings? =)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","arrays","loops"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":13188498,"title":"Main in C not outputting print loop","body":"<p>my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(){\nint marks[100];\nint j;\nint i;\nprintf(\"hello world\");\nfor (i=0; i&gt;100; i++){\n   marks[i]=j;\n   printf(marks[i]);\n   j++;}\nreturn 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm only getting the \"hello world\" output (which is a test).

But, all of that is working correctly, I'm fairly confident, the issue is with one nagging linked list.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, I'm working with a \"calculator\" of sorts, but this calculator is supposed to accept variables that have been stored within a linked list. Phrases like (add 1 4) work just fine, but the tricky part is if you try something like ((let (firstvar 2)) (add firstvar 4)) Now, it's supposed to go through a symbol list (a list of 1 in this case) and find the value of firstvar (that was created, instantiated, and assigned with the let statement prior to the add statement) and put it into the chain. </p>\n\n<p>All that to say, the issue is when I try to pass the \"symbolList\" down to the various operands it overwrites the struct in odd and confusing ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, the main unions from the .h:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef struct\n{\n    double value;\n} NUMBER_AST_NODE;\n\ntypedef struct\n{ \n    char *name;\n} SYMBOL_AST_NODE;\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n   char *name;\n   struct ast_node *op1;\n   struct ast_node *op2;\n} FUNCTION_AST_NODE;\n\ntypedef struct ast_symbol\n{\n    char *name; //symbol name\n    struct ast_node *data;\n\n    struct ast_symbol *next;\n    struct ast_symbol *parent;\n} AST_SYMBOL;\n\ntypedef struct ast_node\n{\n    AST_NODE_TYPE type;\n    union\n    {\n        NUMBER_AST_NODE number;\n        FUNCTION_AST_NODE function;\n        SYMBOL_AST_NODE symbol;\n    } data;\n\n    AST_SYMBOL *symbolList;    \n} AST_NODE; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, and now, assuming the tree has been partially created, the issue is that the \"symbolList\" is attached only to the highest member of the tree... so I need to pass it onto the children (that is, operand 1 &amp; operand 2) so that they will have access to the symbolList and thusly be able to properly translate any variables that are passed into their functions. </p>\n\n<p>So, I'm doing a recursive call like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void translate(AST_NODE *p)\n{\n  //recursive infix traversal.\n  if(p-&gt;type == NUM_TYPE){\n      printf(\"%6f\",(double) p-&gt;data.number.value);\n  }\n  else if (p-&gt;type == SYM_TYPE){\n      resolveSymbol(p-&gt;symbolList, p-&gt;data.symbol.name); //this goes and finds the variable, and it does it correctly IF it has the symbolList!\n  }\n  else if(p-&gt;type == FUNC_TYPE){\n          printf(\"( \");\n\n          p-&gt;data.function.op1-&gt;symbolList = p-&gt;symbolList; //passing the symbolList onward\n\n          translate(p-&gt;data.function.op1);\n          printf( \" %c \",resolveOp(resolvdfunc)); //ignore this, it's just displaying the char like '+' for add\n\n          p-&gt;data.function.op2-&gt;symbolList = p-&gt;symbolList; //passing the symbolList onward\n          translate(p-&gt;data.function.op2);\n          printf(\" )\");\n    }\n  }\n\n   if (!p)\n      return;\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, so, FOR EXAMPLE. Let's say that I comment out the second operand's symbolList passing. Then, a statement like ((let (a 2)) (add a 4)) will work just fine. But, obviously, if I try ((let (a 2)) (add 4 a)) it WON'T work because the second operand doesn't have access to the 'a' variable.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble is that, currently, WITHOUT commenting out that second symbolList passing, it OVERWRITES my FIRST operand and it doesn't have access to the symbolList anymore!</p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense.... it's been driving me insane.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: 9:22 -- Here's the resolveSymbol code (as requested)... </p>\n\n<pre><code>void resolveSymbol(AST_SYMBOL *p, char *name)\n{\n    if (p == NULL)\n        yyerror(\"No such symbol exists\");\n    else if (strcmp(p-&gt;name, name) == 0) {\n        translate(p-&gt;data);\n    }\n    else\n        resolveSymbol(p-&gt;next, name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c","named-pipes","fifo","mkfifo"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":13143279,"title":"FIFOs in C (Named-pipes)","body":"<p>I'm getting permission errors when trying to <code>mkfifo()</code> in the current directory.

The 3rd party code handles the input_file with standard fopen, fseek, fread etc. I want to be able to use multiple input files, treating them as a single file as if they were concatenated in the order they're supplied. I have the 3rd party code but want to modify it as little as possible. Currently am concatenating the files then calling program with the concatenated file as input, I'm trying to eliminate the concatenation as the files can be large and take time. Reading from stdin doesn't do what I want, because the program writes stdin to a file to allow seeks.</p>\n\n<p>The solution I'm working on is to accept the input_file commandline argument as many files concatenated (? delimited), and adding concat_stream.h to the start of the program source (after including stdio). concat_stream.h implements transparently treating multiple streams as one stream by intercepting the standard calls, and implementing the concatenated streams with some global arrays of the streams and accompanying data. Here's a small portion of concat_stream.h as an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    FILE * fopen_concat_streams (char * filename, char * mode )\n    {\n      if( strchr(filename, '?')!=NULL )/*do we want a concat_stream?*/\n        return concat_streams_init(filename, mode);/*setup concat_stream, return first stream as id*/\n      else\n        return fopen(filename, mode);/*standard library implementation*/\n    }\n\n    long int ftell_concat_streams( FILE * stream )\n    {\n      unsigned int index=is_stream_concat(stream);/*work out if stream refers to a concat_stream or regular stream*/\n      if(index!=CONCAT_STREAMS_MAX)/*is stream a concat_stream?*/\n      {\n        ...\n        return answer;/*work out and return location in concat_stream*/\n      }\n      else\n        return ftell(stream);/*standard library implementation*/\n    }\n\n    #define fopen(x, y) fopen_concat_streams(x, y)\n    #define ftell(x) ftell_concat_streams(x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is am I on the right track, and is there an easier way to do it? If there's a library to sort this out for me I'll use that instead, it seems like it should be a popular thing to do but I haven't found anything so far.

All ideas are based upon this small <a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/research/tr/1999/09/CS-99-09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paper</a>.\nMy error is with the indexing operation. Been hacking away for too long to admit. Asking for knowledgable minds and eyes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview</strong>:\nThe data structure consists of 1 flat index block which holds pointers to the data blocks. Each data block has size 2^(k/2). Where k is the leading set bit. So when I search for element \"i\", k is log_2(i+1).</p>\n\n<pre><code>index = { \n    [0], -&gt; [0]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [3],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    [4],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    ....}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The size of each data block is determined by the \"super block\" it is clustered into.

While 0 (super block 0), and index 3 (superblock 2) are not.</p>\n\n<p>You end up with each superblock having 2^(floor(k/2)) data blocks, and each of those data blocks has size 2^(ceil(k/2)).   </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>\nWhen r = a power of 2 the index skips over what is should be.\nLike when I search for 3 it should be <code>index [2][0]</code>, instead its <code>index[3][0]</code>.\nWhy does this happen? any way to avoid it?

In the beginning of the program I have to dynamically allocate memory for a dictionary of length n. The dictionary we were given was length 10000 and the max length for words was 20  characters. I chose to dynamically create an array of permutations of each word then compare them to words in the dictionary with a binary search using strcmp (All words entered in by the user and in the dictionary were all caps making this a viable method). The entire program worked through the first iteration minus duplicate permutations that were valid words and the while loop exiting prematurely.

(for example it can contain maximum 10 char packets and 20 video packets etc.) so we have to have different semaphores for each data type. the issue i know how to control the buffer size with semaphore which is very simple, but cant set the correct idea of using semaphores of packets'. even i tried some different methods i always faced with deadlock errors. here is my pseudocode to understand more clearly of my program.</p>\n\n<pre><code>define struct packege\ndefine semaphore list\n\nmain\n\ninitialize variables and semaphores\n\nwhile threadCounter is less than MaxThreadNumber\n\nswitch(random)\ncase 0: create a character package\n    create a thread to insert the package in buffer\ncase 1: create a video package\n    create a thread to insert the package in buffer\ncase 2: create an image package\n    create a thread to insert the package in buffer\ncase 3: create an audio package\n    create a thread to insert the package in buffer\n\nincrement  threadCounter by one\nend of while\n\ncreate only one thread which will make the dequeue operation\nend of main\n\nproducer function\n\nfor i-&gt;0 to size_of_package\n    sem_wait(empty_buffer) // decrement empty_buffer semaphore by size of package\n\n    lock_mutex\n        insert item into queueu\n        decrement counter of the buffer by size of package\n    unlock_mutex\n\nfor i-&gt;0 to size_of_package\n    sem_post(full_buffer) // increment full_buffer semaphore by size of package\n\nend of producer function\n\nconsumer function\n\nwhile TRUE // Loops forever\n\n    lock_mutex\n\n        if queue is not empty\n            dequeue\n\n        increment counter of the buffer size of package\n\n    unlock_mutex\n\nfor i-&gt;0 to size_of_package // The reason why i making the sem_wait operation here is i cant make the dequeue in outer region of mutex.\n    sem_wait(full_buffer)\nfor i-&gt;0 to size_of_package\n    sem_post(empty_buffer)\nend of consumer function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with this implementation programe works correctly. but i couldnt use semaphores properly which belongs to threads of packages. i can listen every recommandation and will be appreciated for every answer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","pseudocode","code-efficiency","gcd","ti-basic"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":53,"score":2,"question_id":12572520,"title":"Why is TI-Basic so slow?","body":"<p>I decided to implement a program that can find the GCD of any two numbers (including non-integers) in TI-Basic.

Can anyone else compile this and see if they also get the same compilation error?</p>\n\n<p>The strange part is, in the code if I comment out the <code>else if(step_size == 4)</code> part of the code, then the error vanishes. But, sadly my optimization is not complete with out it, so I must have it.</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought its the problem with CodeSourcey compiler (on my host), so I compiled the program on my target directly (My target runs on Ubuntu). I used gcc there and once again, I get the same error and when I comment out the <code>else if(step_size == 4)</code> part, then the error vanishes.</p>\n\n<p>Help!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>PART 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include\"arm_neon.h\"\n\n#define IMAGE_HEIGHT 480\n#define IMAGE_WIDTH  640\n\nfloat32_t integral_image[IMAGE_HEIGHT][IMAGE_WIDTH];\n\nfloat32x4_t box_area_compute3(int, int , int , int , unsigned int , float);\n\ninline int min(int, int);\n\nint main()\n{\n\n box_area_compute3(1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 0);\n\n return 0;\n}\n\nfloat32x4_t box_area_compute3(int row, int col, int num_rows, int num_cols, unsigned int step_size, float three)\n{\n unsigned int height = IMAGE_HEIGHT;\n unsigned int width = IMAGE_WIDTH;\n\n int temp_row = row + num_rows;\n int temp_col = col + num_cols;\n\n int r1 = (min(row, height))- 1 ;\n int r2 = (min(temp_row, height)) - 1;\n\n int c1 = (min(col, width)) - 1;\n int c2 = (min(temp_col, width)) - 1;\n\n float32x4_t v128_areas;\n\n if(step_size == 2)\n {\n  float32x4x2_t top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right;\n  top_left    = vld2q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r1] + c1);\n  top_right   = vld2q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r1] + c2);\n  bottom_left  = vld2q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r2] + c1);\n  bottom_right  = vld2q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r2] + c2);\n\n  v128_areas = vsubq_f32(vsubq_f32(vaddq_f32(top_left.val[0], bottom_right.val[0]), top_right.val[0]), bottom_left.val[0]);\n\n\n }\n else if(step_size == 4)\n {\n  float32x4x4_t top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right;\n  top_left   = vld4q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r1] + c1);\n  top_right   = vld4q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r1] + c2);\n  bottom_left  = vld4q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r2] + c1);\n  bottom_right  = vld4q_f32((float32_t *)integral_image[r2] + c2);\n\n  v128_areas = vsubq_f32(vsubq_f32(vaddq_f32(top_left.val[0], bottom_right.val[0]), top_right.val[0]), bottom_left.val[0]);\n\n }\n\n if(three == 3.0)\n  v128_areas = vmulq_n_f32(v128_areas, three);\n\n return v128_areas;\n\n}\n\ninline int min(int X, int Y)\n{\n return (X &lt; Y ?

I'll start by listing primes, for example, and then maybe some input/output from the user to maybe compute a Fourier transform. I don't know.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't found <em>any</em> information on how to do this, but I can already foresee some problems before I even begin.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, compiling a C program compiles it into one of several different files, depending on the <em>target</em>. For Windows, it's a PE file. For Linux, it's a .out file. These files are both quite different. In my instance, the target isn't Windows or Linux, it's just whatever I have written in the bootloader.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, where would the actual code reside? The bootloader is exactly 512 bytes, but the program I write in C will certainly compile to something much larger. It will need to sit on my (virtual) hard disk, probably in some sort of file system (which I haven't even defined!) and I will need to load the information from this file into memory before I can even think about executing it. But from my understanding, all this is many, many orders of magnitude more complex than a 12-line \"Hello World\" bootloader.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: How do I call a large 32- or 64-bit program (written in C/C++) from my 16-bit bootloader.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":0,"question_id":13114879,"title":"print binary file","body":"<p>Say you have a file dog.txt</p>\n\n<pre><code>The\nquick\nbrown\nfox\njumps\nover\nthe\nlazy\ndog\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can print the lines like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main ()\n{\n  char buf[10];\n  FILE *fp = fopen(\"dog.txt\", \"r\");\n  while (fgets(buf, sizeof buf, fp))\n    printf(\"%s\", buf);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what if each \"line\" was separated by a null character (<code>\\0</code>), instead of a newline (<code>\\n</code>)?

The old implementation used condition variables and with waiting/broadcasting to signal new queue readiness.  The new queue I'm using simply uses a defined size with semaphore locking.  Both queues are correctly implemented, and I am currently assuming the pthread_condition_broadcast signals somehow interfere with the close call.  Not sure about that, but getting rid of the signals stops this from happening.  The threads were always working with the same socket once it was pulled off the queue, so it couldn't be any mixup there.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","pthreads"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":128,"score":1,"question_id":8558020,"title":"How to pass more than one value as an argument to a thread in C?","body":"<p>In C, how can i pass more than one argument to a thread?</p>\n\n<p>Normally, I do it in a way like,</p>\n\n<pre><code> pthread_create(&amp;th,NULL,dosomething,(void*)connfd);\n\n\nvoid * dosomething(void *connfd)\n{\n\n  // Doing something      \n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example,I am passing connfd value only to the thread 'th'. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to pass more than one value so that it can be much useful for me?</p>\n\n<p>One more thing,  Can we pass an array as an argument to a thread?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","floating-point","nan"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":138,"score":3,"question_id":13110825,"title":"divide by zero - c programming","body":"<p>I have a question about the next code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main { \ndouble x = 0;\ndouble y = 0/x;\n\nif(y==1) {.....}\n....\n....\nreturn 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run the code on my I get no run time error and I see that <code>y = -nan(0x8000000000000)</code>.\nWhy it is not a run time to divide by zero?\nbeyond that when I change the first line to : <code>int x = 0;</code>\nnow there is a run time error. what is the difference?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","complexity","metrics","cohesion","code-size"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13110400,"title":"Open Source or Freeware C Code Metrics tools?","body":"<p>I have been trying to find a tool (hopefully for MAC OS X but I don't mind migrating) -- that works -- for those dimensions but I had no luck. <a href=\"http://www.maultech.com/chrislott/resources/cmetrics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maultech</a> mention some, and so does <a href=\"http://www.locmetrics.com/alternatives.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> but I was unable to make them work.

My apologies for not getting the output in the preferred format but the backtraces to the memory are not being easy to format. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Time Interval 4000250\n*** glibc detected *** ./a.out: double free or corruption (out): 0x00007fa2dc000b00 *** \n ======= Backtrace: =========\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x7e626)[0x7fa2e351d626]\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(fclose+0x155)[0x7fa2e350d2a5]\n./a.out[0x400a05]\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0(+0x7e9a)[0x7fa2e3863e9a]\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(clone+0x6d)[0x7fa2e35914bd]\n======= Memory map: ========\n00400000-00401000 r-xp 00000000 07:00 163351                              /home/kartheek    /Desktop/a.out\n00601000-00602000 r--p 00001000 07:00 163351                             /home/kartheek    /Desktop/a.out\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>00602000-00603000 rw-p 00002000 07:00 163351                             /home/kartheek/Desktop/a.out\n    00923000-00944000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]\n    7fa2d4000000-7fa2d4021000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n    7fa2d4021000-7fa2d8000000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \n    7fa2dc000000-7fa2dc021000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n    7fa2dc021000-7fa2e0000000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \n    7fa2e2287000-7fa2e229c000 r-xp 00000000 07:00 4805                       /lib/x86_64-    linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1\n    7fa2e229c000-7fa2e249b000 ---p 00015000 07:00 4805                       /lib/x86_64-    linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1\n    7fa2e249b000-7fa2e249c000 r--p 00014000 07:00 4805                       /lib/x86_64-    linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1\n7fa2e249c000-7fa2e249d000 rw-p 00015000 07:00 4805                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1\n7fa2e249d000-7fa2e249e000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e249e000-7fa2e2c9e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e2c9e000-7fa2e2c9f000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e2c9f000-7fa2e349f000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e349f000-7fa2e3652000 r-xp 00000000 07:00 4784                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so\n7fa2e3652000-7fa2e3851000 ---p 001b3000 07:00 4784                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so\n7fa2e3851000-7fa2e3855000 r--p 001b2000 07:00 4784                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so\n7fa2e3855000-7fa2e3857000 rw-p 001b6000 07:00 4784                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so\n7fa2e3857000-7fa2e385c000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e385c000-7fa2e3874000 r-xp 00000000 07:00 4864                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so\n7fa2e3874000-7fa2e3a73000 ---p 00018000 07:00 4864                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so\n7fa2e3a73000-7fa2e3a74000 r--p 00017000 07:00 4864                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so\n7fa2e3a74000-7fa2e3a75000 rw-p 00018000 07:00 4864                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so\n7fa2e3a75000-7fa2e3a79000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e3a79000-7fa2e3a9b000 r-xp 00000000 07:00 4764                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so\n7fa2e3c80000-7fa2e3c83000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e3c97000-7fa2e3c9b000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \n7fa2e3c9b000-7fa2e3c9c000 r--p 00022000 07:00 4764                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so\n7fa2e3c9c000-7fa2e3c9e000 rw-p 00023000 07:00 4764                       /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so\n7fffa77ef000-7fffa7810000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]\n7fffa784f000-7fffa7850000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                          [vdso]\nffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                  [vsyscall]\nAborted (core dumped)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what that means in the output but the fact that it says Aborted puts me to think that I might be close. </p>\n\n<p>The code works as:</p>\n\n<p>Create the threads\nThread1 accesses file1 and waits in written mode\nThread2 also accesses file1 and tries to make changes to it and then this is what happens</p>\n\n<p>Now, the next step is to create a monitor thread that will run at a higher priority.

The function is as follows (with my attempted pseudocode translation next to it).</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x08048816 &lt;phase_3+0&gt;: push   %ebp\n0x08048817 &lt;phase_3+1&gt;: mov    %esp,%ebp\n0x08048819 &lt;phase_3+3&gt;: push   %edi\n0x0804881a &lt;phase_3+4&gt;: push   %ebx\n0x0804881b &lt;phase_3+5&gt;: sub    $0x30,%esp\n0x0804881e &lt;phase_3+8&gt;: lea    -0x24(%ebp),%eax                             \n0x08048821 &lt;phase_3+11&gt;:    mov    %eax,0x4(%esp)                           \n0x08048825 &lt;phase_3+15&gt;:    mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax                           \n0x08048828 &lt;phase_3+18&gt;:    mov    %eax,(%esp)                              \n0x0804882b &lt;phase_3+21&gt;:    call   0x8048d2c &lt;read_six_numbers&gt;\n0x08048830 &lt;phase_3+26&gt;:    mov    -0x24(%ebp),%eax                     eax = p1\n0x08048833 &lt;phase_3+29&gt;:    cmp    $0x1,%eax                             if eax != 1\n0x08048836 &lt;phase_3+32&gt;:    je     0x804883d &lt;phase_3+39&gt;                   explode bomb\n0x08048838 &lt;phase_3+34&gt;:    call   0x8048fec &lt;explode_bomb&gt;             else\n0x0804883d &lt;phase_3+39&gt;:    movl   $0x1,-0xc(%ebp)                       ebp[-12] = 1\n0x08048844 &lt;phase_3+46&gt;:    jmp    0x804888a &lt;phase_3+116&gt;              while ebp[-12] &lt; 5 {\n0x08048846 &lt;phase_3+48&gt;:    mov    -0xc(%ebp),%eax                          eax = ebp[-12]\n0x08048849 &lt;phase_3+51&gt;:    mov    -0x24(%ebp,%eax,4),%eax                  {magic}\n0x0804884d &lt;phase_3+55&gt;:    mov    %eax,%ebx                                ebx = eax\n0x0804884f &lt;phase_3+57&gt;:    mov    -0xc(%ebp),%eax                          eax = ebp[-12]\n0x08048852 &lt;phase_3+60&gt;:    sub    $0x1,%eax                                 eax -= 1\n0x08048855 &lt;phase_3+63&gt;:    mov    -0x24(%ebp,%eax,4),%eax                  {magic}\n0x08048859 &lt;phase_3+67&gt;:    mov    %eax,%edx                                edx = eax\n0x0804885b &lt;phase_3+69&gt;:    mov    0x804a6d8,%eax                           eax = 0x804a6d8\n0x08048860 &lt;phase_3+74&gt;:    mov    $0xffffffff,%ecx                      ecx = 255\n0x08048865 &lt;phase_3+79&gt;:    mov    %eax,-0x2c(%ebp)                         ebp[-12] = eax\n0x08048868 &lt;phase_3+82&gt;:    mov    $0x0,%eax                                 eax = 0\n0x0804886d &lt;phase_3+87&gt;:    cld                         \n0x0804886e &lt;phase_3+88&gt;:    mov    -0x2c(%ebp),%edi                         edi = ebp[-12]\n0x08048871 &lt;phase_3+91&gt;:    repnz scas %es:(%edi),%al                       {deep magic}\n0x08048873 &lt;phase_3+93&gt;:    mov    %ecx,%eax                                eax = ecx\n0x08048875 &lt;phase_3+95&gt;:    not    %eax                                     eax = -eax\n0x08048877 &lt;phase_3+97&gt;:    sub    $0x1,%eax                                 eax -= 1\n0x0804887a &lt;phase_3+100&gt;:   imul   %edx,%eax                                eax *= edx\n0x0804887d &lt;phase_3+103&gt;:   cmp    %eax,%ebx                                if (eax != ebx)\n0x0804887f &lt;phase_3+105&gt;:   je     0x8048886 &lt;phase_3+112&gt;                      explode_bomb\n0x08048881 &lt;phase_3+107&gt;:   call   0x8048fec &lt;explode_bomb&gt;                 else\n0x08048886 &lt;phase_3+112&gt;:   addl   $0x1,-0xc(%ebp)                           ebp[-12] += 1\n0x0804888a &lt;phase_3+116&gt;:   cmpl   $0x5,-0xc(%ebp)\n0x0804888e &lt;phase_3+120&gt;:   jle    0x8048846 &lt;phase_3+48&gt;               }\n0x08048890 &lt;phase_3+122&gt;:   add    $0x30,%esp\n0x08048893 &lt;phase_3+125&gt;:   pop    %ebx\n0x08048894 &lt;phase_3+126&gt;:   pop    %edi\n0x08048895 &lt;phase_3+127&gt;:   pop    %ebp\n0x08048896 &lt;phase_3+128&gt;:   ret\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am at least a little bit (though not a lot) confident in most of this; the lines that I'm absolutely sure are wrong are the three lines currently marked as \"magic\" -- phase_3+51, phase_3+63, and phase_3+91 (the two mov lines with weird syntax and the repnz).

I will do my best to explain the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The input I am given is a positive integer <em>n</em> followed by <em>n</em> positive integers which represent the frequency (or weight) for symbols in an ordered character set. The first goal is to construct a tree that gives an approximate order-preserving Huffman code for each character of the ordered character set. We are to accomplish this by \"greedily merging the two <em>adjacent</em> trees whose weights have the smallest sum.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the assignment we are shown that a conventional Huffman code tree is constructed by first inserting the weights into a priority queue. Then by using a delmin() function to \"pop\" off the root from the priority queue I can obtain the two nodes with the lowest frequencies and merge them into one node with its left and right being these two lowest frequency nodes and its priority being the sum of the priorities of its children. This merged node then is inserted back into the min-heap. The process is repeated until all input nodes have been merged. I have implemented this using an array of size 2*n*-1 with the input nodes being from 0...<em>n</em>-1 and then from <em>n</em>...2*n*-1 being the merged nodes.</p>\n\n<p>I do not understand how I can greedily merge the two adjacent trees whose weights have the smallest sum.

This project is a 3D-engine(using SDL and openGL for input handling, and graphics respectively). I have been working on this project in linux(Ubuntu 10.10) for the past several months and recently decided to port the code over to a Windows 7 environment. One of the main reasons I chose SDL was because it handles window creation independent of operating system, meaning it should be rather simple to port from one OS to another. I am not having problems compiling or linking, it's the problem that the exact same code is running in two completely different ways for apparently no reason. </p>\n\n<p>First off, a visual example of the differences:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's not supposed to look this way, first off the purple revtanglers in the lower left are supposed to be text, and if you look REALLLY closely you can see some points being rendered, I'm using geometry, vertex, and pixel shaders:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It should look a lot more like this, as it does in linux.

It would be ideal to support international languages in a uniform way but that doesn't seem to be easily accomplished when considering the two platforms in question.  I have spent a considerable amount of time reading up on UNICODE, UTF-8 (and other encodings), widechars and such and here is what I have come to understand so far:</p>\n\n<p>UNICODE, as the standard, describes the set of characters that are mappable and the order in which they occur.  I refer to this as the \"what\": UNICODE specifies <em>what</em> will be available.</p>\n\n<p>UTF-8 (and other encodings) specify the <em>how</em>: How each character will be represented in a binary format.</p>\n\n<p>Now, on windows, they opted for a UCS-2 encoding originally, but that failed to meet the requirements, so UTF-16 is what they have, which is also multi-char when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>So here is the delemma:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Windows internally only does UTF-16, so if you want to support international characters you are forced to convert to their widechar versions to use the OS calls accordingly.  There doesn't seem to be any support for calling something like CreateFileA() with a multi-byte UTF-8 string and have it come out looking proper.  Is this correct?</li>\n\n<li>In C, there are some multi-byte supporting functions (_mbscat, _mbscpy, etc), however, on windows, the character type is defined as unsigned char* for those functions.  Given the fact that the _mbs series of functions is not a complete set (i.e. there is no _mbstol to convert a multi-byte string to a long, for example) you are forced to use some of the char* versions of the runtime functions, which leads to compiler problems because of the signed/unsigned type difference between those functions.  Does anyone even use those?  Do you just do a big pile of casting to get around the errors?</li>\n\n<li>In C++, std::string has iterators, but these are based on char_type, not on code points.  So if I do a ++ on an std::string::iterator, I get the next char_type, not the next code point.  Similarly, if you call std::string::operator[], you get a reference to a char_type, which has the great potential to not be a complete code point.  So how does one iterate an std::string by code point?
