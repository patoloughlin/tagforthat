Here's how they did it:\nWe requested for the Global.asax file and we found that there is a redirection code present in it as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Protected Sub Application_BeginRequest(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs)\n    If HttpContext.Current.Request.IsSecureConnection.Equals(False) And mid(Request.ServerVariables(\"HTTP_HOST\"), 1, 9) &lt;&gt; \"localhost\" Then\n        Response.Redirect(\"https://\" &amp; Request.ServerVariables(\"HTTP_HOST\") &amp; HttpContext.Current.Request.RawUrl)\n    End If\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We analyzed all the data again that we have and we found that when we try to read the service configuration it is unable to read the config file and hence it makes use of all the default configuration. This is clearly seen in the trace. This is because it is unable to find the service tag and hence it makes use of all default setting. Also we find that your service listens on 2 endpoints – http and https. So when we browse the wsdl file we find that your service is basically configured to listen on http instead of https. Hence we find that your method StartQuote is configured to listen on http. Hence the client makes a call on http for this interface and your global.asax file catches this and redirects to https.</p>\n\n<p>From the WCF traces that we had collected we found that we were getting the error of Configuration Evaluation context not found followed by No matching  tag was found as shown below:</p>\n\n<p>The error configuration evaluation context not found means that we are unable to read the correct configuration from the config file. Also as there was no service tag defined under the System.ServiceModel tag it was picking up the default configuration i.e. basichttpbinding without SSL. Hence when the client tries to make a method call, it will make a call on http instead of https which gets picked up by your global.asax file and redirects it to https.</p>\n\n<p>We went ahead and added the Service tag under System.ServiceModel tag as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;services&gt;\n  &lt;service name=\"EdisonQuotingService\"&gt;\n    &lt;endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"(binding name specified by you)_Transport\"\n      contract=\"IService\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/service&gt;\n&lt;/services&gt;\n\n&lt;basicHttpBinding&gt;\n    &lt;binding name=\"(binding name specified by you)\"&gt;\n      &lt;security mode=\"Transport\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/binding&gt;\n  &lt;/basicHttpBinding&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We made the above changes after which when we tried to call the method StartQuote from WCF service it worked fine with no issues and you were able to get the necessary data.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13297071,"title":"ASP:Dropdownlist OnSelectedIndexChanged Event Not Firing","body":"<p>I have a non-databound Dropdownlist inside of an UpdatePanel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:UpdatePanel runat=\"server\" ID=\"FiltersUpdPnl\"&gt;\n    &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"filters\"&gt;\n            &lt;asp:Button runat=\"server\" ID=\"ExportBtn\" Text=\"Export Map to Image\" /&gt;\n            &lt;br /&gt;\n            Show: \n            &lt;asp:DropDownList runat=\"server\" ID=\"CapNumProjectsDDL\" AutoPostBack=\"true\" OnSelectedIndexChanged=\"ApplyFilters\" OnPreRender=\"CapNumProjectsDDL_PreRender\"&gt;\n                &lt;%--&lt;asp:ListItem Value=\"0\" Text=\"\" Selected=\"True\"&gt;&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;--%&gt;\n                &lt;asp:ListItem Value=\"1\" Text=\"Capacity\"&gt;&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;\n                &lt;asp:ListItem Value=\"2\" Text=\"Number of Projects\"&gt;&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;\n            &lt;/asp:DropDownList&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The event handler isn't terribly important, it just does stuff:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void ApplyFilters(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    //Do Stuff relating to the selected Value\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the page loads, \"Capacity\" is selected by default, as it's the first ListItem.

This does not happen on the development machine (here the report displays without any prompts). Please help me troubleshoot this problem. Why I'm I being prompted for a username and password? Why is the page displaying the report server instead of the report?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code I use to load the report.</p>\n\n<pre><code>reportViewer.ProcessingMode = Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms.ProcessingMode.Remote;\n//AppReportServerCredentials contains the user name and password of a user allowed to view reports on the server\nreportViewer.ServerReport.ReportServerCredentials = new AppReportServerCredentials();\nreportViewer.ServerReport.ReportServerUrl = new Uri(\"http://localhost/reportserver\");\nreportViewer.ServerReport.ReportPath = \"/reports_folder/report_name\";\nparam1 = new ReportParameter(\"param1\", 1234);\nparam2 = new ReportParameter(\"param2\", \"abcd\");\nreportViewer.ServerReport.SetParameters(new ReportParameter[] { param1, param2 });\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","reporting-services","google-chrome","reportviewer"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2404,"score":5,"question_id":1784642,"title":"ASP.NET ReportViewer Google Chrome CPU usage","body":"<p>We have found an interesting issue between ASP.NET 3.5 and ReportViewer with Google Chrome.

It's the download itself that I can't get to work.</p>\n\n<p>My code for attaching the vCard to the page response looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void downloadCard()\n{\n    //generate the vCard text\n    string vCard = generateCard();\n\n    //create the filename the user will download the file as\n    string filename = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(username + \".vcf\", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8);\n\n    //get a reference to the response\n    HttpResponse response = HttpContext.Current.Response;\n\n    //clear the response and write our own one.\n    response.Clear();\n    response.ContentType = \"text/x-vcard\";\n    response.AddHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=\" + filename + \";\");\n    response.Write(vCard);\n    response.End();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I won't bother showing the generation process as it's not really important though the only parameter the page takes is for a username which is received through a RESFUL URL thanks to some URL rewriting in the web.config file.  So the URL example.com/vcard/apbarratt produces the vCard for the user, apbarratt.</p>\n\n<p>The response that a GET request produces for this code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>200 OK\nDate: Wed, 15 Aug 2012 13:49:56 GMT\nX-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=apbarratt.vcf;\nContent-Length: 199\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/7.5\nContent-Type: text/x-vcard; charset=utf-8\nCache-Control: private\nBEGIN:VCARD\nVERSION:2.1\nN;LANGUAGE=en-us:Andy Barratt\nFN:Andy Barratt\nTEL;CELL;VOICE:07000000000\nURL;WORK:http://example.com\nEMAIL;INTERNET:apbarratt@example.com\nEND:VCARD\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works perfectly in every single browser that I have tested it in (not iOS, that's another issue that has been solved in another way), except for Android stock browsers.  In these browsers, the download fails, either with the filename \"unknown\" and the term \"failed\" or on other devices with the username \"apbarratt.vcf\" and the term \"In progress\" which doesn't ever seem to change.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is not a problem in other browsers such as opera mobile/mini.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried every possible thing I can think of, reading so many blogs on similar issues that I'm having dreams about the whole thing... they're really dull...</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, hopefully some fresh eyes will be able to help me.

For example: \"Welcome to the CompanyX web portal\" or \"Contact CompanyX support for more info\".\nNow we want to deploy an instance of this application for Company Y instead. So we want a good way to dynamically replace the company name in all the resources. \nWe think that a workable way to achieve this, is to replace CompanyX with a named placeholder like $COMPANYNAME$ in all the resX files (simple find-replace). \nThen, at runtime, replace that placeholder with the actual company name, which is unique per physical deployment and defined in the settings.</p>\n\n<p>The place where we could do that dynamic replacement could be a custom implementation of IResourceProvider. After a string is looked up we could run our custom replacement logic on it.\nThe \"GetObject\" method seems wel suited for this task. Apart from this little hook, our custom implementation should look up local and global resources EXACTLY the same way as the default ResourceProvider, which suits our needs fine.\nHowever, I failed to find the source of the default ResourceProvider online. I only find examples of highly customized IResourceProvider implementations (e.g. that use the db). </p>\n\n<p>First question:\nIs this a decent approach to solving the main problem (replacing the company name in our resource strings? \nThe BIG advantage with this approach is that we wouldn't need to modify the aspx markup or code that uses the resources. We don't want to wrap every reference to a resource with a custom function call to do the placeholder formatting.\nAlso, just duplicating the resx files and doing find-replace is not option. We want to limit the number of files and strings to maintain!\nIf we can get the same advantages with another approach, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Second question:\nCan someone show me how to implement this concept without disturbing the default handling of global and local resources? All I need is a way to hook in somewhere after the value is loaded, and execute the replacement logic.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","vb.net","security","encryption"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":150,"score":3,"question_id":12546652,"title":"ASP.net Encrypt Files After Upload / Decrypt To User","body":"<p>I am doing some research and development into a possible project that my potential client is discussing with me.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking at creating an asp.net 4.5 web application that will be accessed over the web and hold some pretty sensitive information.

Also it seems pointless since I have the objects so why not let me connected them and update the graph.

Essentially what I am trying to do is re-create the situation in ColdFusion where I can perform the equivalent of a cfoutput's group attribute. I'm so used to just calling a stored procedure and then doing</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;cfoutput group=\"id\"&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>and then another inner cfoutput for any columns that have non-distinct data. Works like a charm! Not so much in Asp.Net.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to stay with using my stored procedure, which is returning a join from two tables with a one-to-many relationship. For example's sake let's say I have 3 columns: a full name, a title, and a graduation year. The graduation year is the column from the joined table, so my result from the stored procedure looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>Jim   Professor    2005<br>\nJim   Professor    2008<br>\nJim   Professor    2011</p>\n\n<p>I am sending this to the View. I am assuming it's the View's job to then group the data based on one of the columns (probably the full name). I want to output an HTML table with 3 columns and in this situation I would have ONE row:</p>\n\n<p>Jim   Professor   2005, 2008, 2011</p>\n\n<p>I have googled tons of examples that use this thing called a group key. This does not seem to help me because I'm not interested in just outputting one value \"Jim\" (or whatever the grouped value is), I need both \"Jim\" and \"Professor\" values to be output for each row. My thinking is I would need 2 foreach loops, the outer loop displaying the fullname and title and the inner loop going through all possible matches for the graduation years. I cannot seem to get the graduation years in a group, especially with this IGrouping syntax. The key can only store one value and I need every value on that row, I only really need one or two values to be iterated over. Should I try and create a custom view model after I perform a secondary linq grouping and then send that to a strongly typed view?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nOk, I have code that works but it seems very inefficient as I basically have to re-define all of the columns/values that I have from my stored procedure. It almost makes me want to forget stored procedures and just use LINQ for everything. It seems what I was asking for is a kind of \"group on multiple columns\" and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5231845/c-sharp-linq-group-by-on-multiple-columns\">link</a> helped immensely.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var records = db.getRecords();\nvar groups = from r in records\n    group r by new\n    {\n       r.id\n    }\n    into row\n    select new ListVM()\n    {\n       id = row.Key.id,\n       fullname = row.Select(x =&gt; x.fullname).First(),\n       title = row.Select(x =&gt; x.title).First(),\n       degrees = row.Select(x =&gt; x.degree_name).ToList(),\n       majors = row.Select(x =&gt; x.major_name).ToList()\n    };\nreturn View(groups);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I of course had to create a ViewModel for this to work. In my view then I can use for loops to iterate over the degrees and majors lists. Is this the best way to do this? I just generally need more than just the group key to display my entire row of information, and only want to iterate over lists once or twice in a 20 column row, as opposed to only displaying the group key once and iterating over everything in most examples I see.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","cpu","windbg"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":3,"question_id":13278210,"title":"How to find our what ThreadPool worker thread is doing?","body":"<p>I have 100% CPU utilization in w3wp.exe and top 3 threads by CPU is shown below </p>\n\n<p>When I switch to one of the threads in question (for example 18) I get error below when trying to walk callstack so I assume it's unmanaged code only and \"k\" and \"dumpstack\" are below as well</p>\n\n<p>So myquestion is how do I find out what is consuming all CPU on those Theadpool worker threads?</p>\n\n<pre><code>    0:018&gt;

This page has a Sqldatasource object for the GridView, as well as each dropdownlist in the GridView's edit mode. This page works beautifully until I changed one field from open text to a drop down, where the items in the drop down are dependent on the selected item of another column. Per record, there is a column for 'Site' and 'room' and the dropdownlist for room will change based on the chosen site. I also need to add a blank item to the top of the dropdownlist to support new/null records. To support null records, I changed the dropdownlist for the room column to AppendDataBoundItems = true so that I can add a blank item, and then the items retrieved from the sqldatasource are loaded after it. The issue with this implementation is that with each change of the site dropdownlist (and it's postback) a new list of room numbers will be appended to the room dropdownlist, which is not desired, the list should be cleared and reloaded on each change of the site column. In order to resolve this issue, I added the following code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void DropDownListSite_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        DropDownList drop = (DropDownList)GridView1.Rows[GridView1.EditIndex].FindControl(\"DropDownListSite\");\n        Session[\"atSite\"] = drop.SelectedItem.Text;\n        DropDownList roomdrop =

The latter are just compiled into the class library, the former are part of the class library too and can easily be detected by convention in the web app. Now for views, be it ascx, aspx or cshtml, it becomes a different story. As far as I can tell, these are the options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Embedded views</strong>, served through a VirtualPathProvider. You keep the run-time compilation, but you cannot change the view from within the web site, though you <em>can</em> set it up to hook into the fallback chain of available view locations.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Compiled views</strong>. This basically boils down to the code-behind scenario. I think the same remarks hold as for embedded views.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>NuGet package</strong> which copies over the view files.

Here's what I've tried to do:</p>\n\n<p>1) I have ASP.NET application which has <strong>Preloader</strong> class that inherits <strong>IProcessHostPreloadClient</strong> and does all the heavy initialization in <em>Preload</em> method implementation (application is complex and it's a part of an enormous system, so it requires approximately 2 minutes to establish connections to all necessary services and pre-instantiate some Unity registrations).</p>\n\n<p>2) I have a lot of work that needs to be done on application shutdown (unsubscribing, disconnecting, disposing,...), and I guess the best place to do it is in *Application_End* method located in <strong>Global.asax</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>3) Everything works just fine when I have user activity (first request after the Application Pool that contains aforementioned web application is started will cause *Application_Start* to be called and afterwards *Application_End* is called on Application Pool stop or recycle), but problems occur when there is no user activity and application tries to restart itself after being active for 48 hours (configured requirement). Since there was no requests, application officially didn't get started. Ergo, it can't be gracefully stopped since *Application_End* won't be called.</p>\n\n<p>4) Now comes the messy part... I've tried to make a GET request from code at the end of the <em>Preload</em> method, and it worked. But this solution seemed bad to me, even though it worked. So, I've tried a lot of things, and the last thing I tried was this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SimpleWorkerRequest swr = new SimpleWorkerRequest(string.Empty, string.Empty, tw);\nHttpRuntime.ProcessRequest(swr);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and that has done it's purpose. *Application_Start* was called, (I've checked response, it was containing login page that was supposed to be displayed in initial request) and on Application Pool shutdown application ended gracefully by doing necessary work in *Application_End*.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the application was started (preloaded and initiated) in this manner, this is what happened when I wanted to reach application via Web browser:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HTTP Error 500.21 - Internal Server Error\n  Handler \"ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0\" has a bad module \"ManagedPipelineHandler\" in its module list</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am unable to figure this out. Can anybody tell me why this happens and how to fix it?</p>\n\n<p>If I don't figure this out, I will go back to first solution (sending GET request from code) but this problem will bug me since I don't even have an idea what's wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","vb.net","parsing","file-io"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":2,"question_id":13259999,"title":"Why are the values in the array retained in the while loop?

My form is using a pretty typical table based layout where the table is used to display a grid of labels and fields for the user to fill out. (I already know table based layouts are eschewed by some people, and I understand the pros and cons. But that's the choice I've made, so please don't answer with \"Don't use a table based layout\".)</p>\n\n<p>Now my problem is that there are times when I would <em>like</em> to wrap an UpdatePanel around a set of rows so that I can hide and show them dynamically, but the UpdatePanel doesn't really let you do that.  The basic problem is that it wraps a div around them, and as far as I know, you cannot wrap a div around table rows. It is not valid HTML.</p>\n\n<p>So the way I have been dealing with it is to make my dynamic rows part of a whole new table entirely, which is OK, but then you have to deal with aligning all the columns manually with the table above it, and that is a real pain and pretty fragile.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question is... does anyone know of any technique for dynamically generating or refreshing rows using either an UpdatePanel or something similar? Hopefully, the solution would be almost as easy as dropping an UpdatePanel on the page, but even if not, I'd still like to hear it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","windows-authentication"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13266156,"title":"Windows Authentication Issue","body":"<p>I have create a asp.net application and using windows authentication.

There is no way around it other than one of the following:\n1) Use a more modern type of web service.\n2) Don't use a common DLL\n3) Manually fix every time you update the web reference, as in the original question above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","content-management-system","sitecore","sitecore6"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"question_id":13261332,"title":"Sitecore tree expand event handler","body":"<p>Does anyone know which event/pipeline/command I can hook into when someone clicks on a item node to expand the tree?</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net","drop-down-menu"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2907,"score":0,"question_id":5335912,"title":"Disable ASP.NET DropDownList using Jquery?","body":"<p>Simple but weird? problem.

If it doesn't point to a valid link, adding CNN's url prefix to it, and seeing if that is then a valid link. But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since I'd be running each link twice, that'd be a problem where POST operations were required, as it'd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API I'm consuming off a public framework, I wouldn't have control of the source code to safeguard against that.</p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions?\nIs there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do easily?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","html5","internet-explorer","cross-browser","internet-explorer-9"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13259958,"title":"IE9 throwing site to Quirks mode","body":"<p>I want to avoid that.

I need to pass a few parameters from an ASPX code-behind, which hosts a Silverlight object tag, to the code-behind of one, or more, of the Silverlight user controls within the hosted Silverlight application.</p>\n\n<p>So, after doing some research, this is the basic solution I developed...</p>\n\n<p>I found out that an attribute can be added to the object tag called initParams, a comma delimited list of parameter names and values can be added to this attribute. Like so...</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;object data=\"data:application/x-silverlight-2,\" type=\"application/x-silverlight-2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"source\" value=\"ClientBin/SampleApplication.xap\"/&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"onError\" value=\"onSilverlightError\" /&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"background\" value=\"white\" /&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"minRuntimeVersion\" value=\"3.0.40624.0\" /&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"autoUpgrade\" value=\"true\" /&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"initParams\" value='DealerId=17' /&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is fine, except that the DealerId parameter is basically hard-coded in the object tag, not real useful. </p>\n\n<p>The next thing that I did was replace this object tag with a literal control, and set the text of the literal control within the page's code-behind to the value of a StringBuilder (where I built up the full object tag along with dynamically adding the correct DealerId value). In the following example, the DealerId is hard-coded, but you get the idea.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var sb = new StringBuilder();\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;object data=\"\"data:application/x-silverlight-2,\"\" type=\"\"application/x-silverlight-2\"\" width=\"\"90%\"\" height=\"\"80%\"\"&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"source\"\" value=\"\"ClientBin/Ascend.SilverlightViewer.xap\"\"/&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"onError\"\" value=\"\"onSilverlightError\"\" /&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"background\"\" value=\"\"white\"\" /&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"minRuntimeVersion\"\" value=\"\"3.0.40624.0\"\" /&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"autoUpgrade\"\" value=\"\"true\"\" /&gt;\");\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;param name=\"\"initParams\"\" value='\");\n            sb.Append(@\"ServiceUrl=\");\n            sb.AppendFormat(\"http://{0}{1}\", Request.Url.Authority, ResolveUrl(\"~/ReportService.svc\"));\n            sb.Append(@\",DebugMode=Full\");\n            sb.AppendFormat(@\",DealerId={0}' /&gt;\", 40);\n            sb.Append(@\"&lt;/object&gt;\");\n\n            litObjectTag.Text = sb.ToString();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My goal, if this initial design is sane, is to then pull this object tag creation into a server control, which will have a DealerId property, which in turn will be set within the hosts code-behind.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I have the host dynamically adding parameter values to the object tag's initParams attribute, the next step is to get these values and leverage them within the hosted Silverlight application.</p>\n\n<p>I found a few articles to help out with this; I'm creating a public dictionary within the App.xaml.cs, and setting it within the Application_Startup event...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; InitConfigDictionary;\n\nprivate void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)\n{\n  InitConfigDictionary = e.InitParams;\n  this.RootVisual = new MainPage();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I can access this public dictionary from the code-behind of any .xaml user control, like this...</p>\n\n<p>App app = (App)Application.Current;\nvar dealerId = app.InitConfigDictionary[\"DealerId\"];</p>\n\n<p>This design works just fine, I'm just looking for some guidance, since I'm new to Silverlight. Once again, the implementation works, but it seems like a whole lot of work to go through just to pass a dynamic value from the host to the .xaml files. </p>\n\n<p>Because I'm new to Silverlight, I'm hoping that someone with more experience can say that either:</p>\n\n<p>a) Patrick, you're insane, why are you going through all this work when clearly in Silverlight you would accomplish this through the use of \"xxxxxx\".</p>\n\n<p>b) Yeah, Patrick, it's a drag, but this design is basically what you have to do in Silverlight.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, any guidance that could be provided would be much appreciated, thanks.\n - PWK</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-2"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":965,"score":1,"question_id":2846090,"title":"RedirectToAction for areas?","body":"<p>I have setup some areas, but I'm not sure how to Redirect to them via the RedirectToAction method.

Let's say we choose HomeController/Index. We end up with the following URLs serving up the same content:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mydomain.com/</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/Home/Index</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now if people start linking to both of these then PageRank would be split. Google would also consider it duplicate content and penalize one of them to avoid duplicates in their results.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, the URLs are not case sensitive, so we actually get the same content for these URLs too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mydomain.com/Home/Index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/home/index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/Home/index</li>\n<li>mydomain.com/home/Index</li>\n<li>(the list goes on)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, the question... How do I avoid these penalties? I would like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All requests for the default action to be redirected (301 status) to the same url</li>\n<li>All URLs to be case sensitive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","asp.net-mvc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":1,"question_id":13254539,"title":"NullReferenceException from ViewData which is Not Null actually","body":"<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mm6e6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScreenShot</a></p>\n\n<p>I think the screenshot explains everything.

The setup/architecture I've designed thus far is similar to a lightweight custom ESB. I have one main \"broker\" service (using wsHttp), that connects to three underlying netTcp services. Both the broker and underlying services share a common assembly that contains the model, as well as the contract interfaces. In the broker service I can choose which operations from the underlying services I want to expose. The idea is that potentially we can have a core of set of services and few different brokers on top of them depending on the business need.

This is why the system, uid, and pwd are designated as parameters in the connection (and not just stackoverflow I-dont-want-to-give-out-data placeholders)  </p>\n\n<p>The *USRLIBL then pulls the necessary libraries from the API user. </p>\n\n<p>To Clarify, the way it's set up does work using the iDB2 Connector, but because of the limitations of our ERP system (we think), using it with an IIS 7 server causes a catastrophic failure, so we're working with the ODBC connector. </p>\n\n<p><strong>End Edit:</strong> </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":40,"score":-4,"question_id":13243322,"title":"How do i validate a field based on the content of another field","body":"<p>i have 2 fields and i need to make one of the fields a required fields only if the other field has content of \"NO\" value in it. thanks</p>\n\n<p>Here is what i found but would like to understand first how this function works\n.getElementById .... do i need to write some kind of code for the .getElementById?</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n        function Validate(source, args) {\n                if (document.getElementById('&lt;%= TextBox1.ClientID %&gt;').value.toUpperCase() == \"NO\" &amp;&amp;\n                document.getElementById('&lt;%= TextBox2.ClientID %&gt;').value.length == 0)\n                        args.IsValid = false;\n                else\n                        args.IsValid = true;\n        }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n        &lt;asp:TextBox ID=\"TextBox1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;\n        &lt;asp:TextBox ID=\"TextBox2\" runat=\"server\"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;\n        &lt;asp:CustomValidator ID=\"CustomValidator1\" runat=\"server\" ErrorMessage=\"TextBox2 Should Be Filled\"\n                Display=\"Dynamic\" ClientValidationFunction=\"Validate\" OnServerValidate=\"CustomValidator1_ServerValidate\"&gt;&lt;/asp:CustomValidator&gt;\n        &lt;asp:Button ID=\"Button1\" runat=\"server\" Text=\"Button\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nprotected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n                if (!Page.IsPostBack)\n                {\n                        Page.Validate();\n                        if (!Page.IsValid)\n                                Response.Write(\"TextBox2 should be filled\");\n\n                }\n        }\n\n        protected void CustomValidator1_ServerValidate(object source, ServerValidateEventArgs args)\n        {\n                args.IsValid = !(this.TextBox1.Text.Equals(\"NO\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase) &amp;&amp; this.TextBox2.Text.Length == 0);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","html","html5","twitter-bootstrap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13254346,"title":"IE9 Rendering Twitter Bootstrap in Quirks 5.5 mode","body":"<p>I have the following code in my html5.Master file for my C# ASP.NET pages using Twitter Bootstrap.

So ProjectA has a reference to DLLs built from ProjectB  and both ProjectA and ProjectB contain references to ProjectC's built DLLs. <a href=\"http://5arx.tumblr.com/image/35120083874\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crude schematic is available here for clarity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This seems like a reasonable setup but of course in practice it will mean that anyone working on of the three projects will still need to <code>pull</code> (<code>get latest</code> version of) all three projects, build them and then work on the one they are focusing in. I'm new to git and I'm not sure if there is a better way of working with .Net projects. </p>\n\n<p>An ideal scenario for me would be if a successful check-in by anyone in the team would result in the latest DLLs making their way to the each of the project members' workstations and update their version automatically. Is this something that can easily be achieved? Its at these points I wonder if leaving TFS is the way to go, it seems a much smarter, more 'joined-up' way of working but hopefully I'm missing a trick.</p>\n\n<p>I'd be very grateful if someone could steer me in a sensible direction or conversely reassure me that I'm doing the right thing.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","asp.net-mvc","wif"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1154,"score":3,"question_id":4751125,"title":"Microsoft.IdentityModel vs System.IdentityModel","body":"<p>I'm working on a claims-based authorization system using Forms Authentication and ASP.NET MVC 2.

In some situations, the user doesn't appear to stay logged in. I've been monitoring traffic in Fiddler, and some details I've found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The problem is 100% repeatable on an older laptop of mine when running IE7 and the project manager's laptop when running IE7. The problem does not ever occur on my current laptop running IE7, or any of these laptops when running FF.</li>\n<li>The problem occurs only in production--not on development, internal staging, or client staging. Production is the only load balanced environment, but the repeatability noted above makes me question load balancing as a factor.</li>\n<li>When the page which sets Session(\"ID\") = 1 sends a response back to the client, I can see a \"Set-Cookie\" header in all cases, which is creating the ASP.Net_Session_Id cookie (and it's HttpOnly).</li>\n<li>Subsequent requests to the server will send that cookie in the header on machines which are not exhibiting the problem, but not on machines that are, so either the cookie is getting deleted or the \"Set-Cookie\" header is being ignored.</li>\n<li>The way logging in works is as follows: a page on www.DomainX.com has an iframe. The source of that iframe is a page on login.DomainY.com. A variety of pages served from login.DomainY.com take the user through the login/register process. The final step of login.DomainY.com is to redirect to a page back on www.DomainX.com, including the user's ID in the querystring. This page on www.DomainX.com typically stores the ID in session, and then runs some JS to redirect the top level document to a new page, thus taking the user out of the iframe. This is a process that has worked for several years, with several values of DomainX.com. The one thing that may be different here is that in this case, the JS is simply destroying the iframe and some containing div's.</li>\n<li>Another difference I see between scenarios where the problem occurs and where it doesn't is in the Google Analytics cookies. There is a difference when login.DomainY.com/FinalStep.aspx does its redirect to www.DomainX.com/SaveTheID.aspx inside the iframe. When the problem does not occur, the request for SaveTheID.aspx includes a variety of Google Analytics cookies (__utma, __utmz, etc). When the problem does occur, this request does not include all the GA cookies (it's missing __utma, __utmz and __utmb).</li>\n<li>Production is the only environment where login.DomainY.com runs under SSL, so I thought that may be related. But we temporarily set up our staging copy of login.DomainY.com to use SSL, and that had no effect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any ideas what could cause this?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: the production environment have domains of www.DomainX.com and DomainX.com. There is another known issue with the cookies not being set for both of those domains. It's possible this is related, but I won't be able to test until that fix goes to prod.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","web-config"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13246236,"title":"Web.config set customErrors mode off but say please off custom error","body":"<p>I have a problem,I want see my error in asp.net but when Error Occur, say set customErrors mode to Off or On Or RemoteOnly,i set Off,but dont show error and say again please set to On</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2ZzPb.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ayvbh.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>when set mode to On,say Please set customErrors mode to On</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Deya7.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tXTCG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>please help me</p>\n\n<p>best regards</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13246101,"title":"add row from asp.net code behind to htmltable","body":"<p>I am trying to add a new row to HtmlTable on click of button Add Row.\nIt adds one row.

My application is definitely picking up the new root web.config (I've tested this), however the <code>&lt;httpRuntime requestValidationMode=\"2.0\" /&gt;</code> directive seems to just be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>My application is configured as a .NET 4.0 application on both my local machine and on the test server.  I've tried rebuilding the application and redeploying it to the test web server.  Can anyone suggest what I need to do to get this working?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance, Chris</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13245712,"title":"How to lock/unlock a user in MVC SimpleMembership","body":"<p>In SimpleMembership there isn't any column in the database for a user to be locked/unlocked.\nI basically need my administrator to enable or disable any user in my application.\nIs there any alternatives to that?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","open","openldap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13245822,"title":"\"Unable to cast object of System.Byte[] to ActiveDs.IADsSecurityDescriptor\"","body":"<p>My problem is that I am using <code>LDAPconnection</code> class and connecting over SSL.

The code I have right now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:Label id=Label1 EnableViewState=\"False\" runat=\"server\" Text='&lt;%# \"&lt;A  id=\"\"launcher\"\" class=\"\"track\"\" Href=\"\"\"&amp;amp;DataBinder.Eval(Container, \"DataItem.Url\")&amp;amp;\"\"\"&gt;\"&amp;amp;DataBinder.Eval(Container, \"DataItem.Name\")&amp;amp;\"&lt;/A&gt;\" %&gt;'&gt;\n&lt;/asp:Label&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Within the <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>, I have tried: <code>onclick=\"\"test();return false;\"\"</code>, the same thing except with <code>onclientclick</code>, with and without the <code>return false;</code> (also tried <code>true</code>).</p>\n\n<p>The function I have:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>function test() {\n  window.location.href=\"#feature\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Problem is that it never does the onclick event. I tried putting a breakpoint at that spot, which gets hit when I click the link, but I never see the content that should be displayed. Is what I'm trying to do even possible, this way or some other way?</p>\n\n<p>jsFiddle: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/hk3Wd/6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/hk3Wd/6/</a>. This is behaving slightly differently than on the website I'm working on. On the website, the lightbox shows but no download. In that fiddle, the download starts but not lightbox.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","devexpress"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":13241683,"title":"How to Upgrade DevExPress from 9.3 to 12.1 ASP.NET","body":"<p>We have asp.net application using DevExpress 9.3 version and we have to upgrade to 12.1, what is the best way to upgrade ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-webforms","model-binding","asp.net-4.5","webformsmvp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13240306,"title":"Value converter for ASP.Net Webforms","body":"<p>I'm putting together a web forms application that is utilizing the <a href=\"http://webformsmvp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebFormsMvp library</a>.

Since they are zero-based, I thought it should be index \"2\".  Perhaps the embedded divs on \"tabs-2\" causes the issue?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","vb.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":0,"question_id":13239831,"title":"populating a formview","body":"<p>If I have a class called \"car\" and this car class uses a SQL query to fill properties like ID, Name, Type, Model, Engine, and Size.

We are hosting a Sitecore application and I hesitated in adding it as a tag, because I really feel it's more the 'why' of the question and not necessarily related to the underlying tech that's causing the problem.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things Sitecore does is add a boatload of custom pipelines. One of these pipelines is called the <code>LayoutResolverPipeline</code>, which is responsible for determining the path to the layout file the requested page will use. We've come up with a terribly useful and complicated way of hosting global content items across multiple domains. Which domain will serve which items is completely configurable through the Administrator web GUI (aka the Sitecore shell). The end goal is to make it possible for our marketing/consumer experience team to run multivariate testing to find the best user experience.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, we have a 'launch' page that is responsible for considering everything about the current user, everything about the current system and domain settings, and determines which experience to give the customer. For most domains, this comes down to a weighted roll of the dice - for the test results to be statistically sound, they have to be sufficiently random. It is written as an <code>IHttpHandler</code> and it stores its decisions in the <code>HttpContext.Current.Session</code> (which is accomplished by also having it implement the <code>IRequiresSessionState</code> interface). The decision is stored so that if the customer decides to backtrack, we don't roll the dice again and instead give them a consistent experience for the duration of their visit. The decision is carried out by the handler issuing a 302 redirect for the next page in the customer's visit.</p>\n\n<p>The launch handler is defined in the web.config file in the usual way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;\n&lt;handlers&gt;\n    &lt;add verb=\"*\" path=\"launch.ashx\"\n       type=\"CMS.HttpHandlers.LaunchRequestHandler, CMS\"\n       name=\"LaunchHandler\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We occasionally do business with partners who, for whatever reason, don't want the resultant 302 between their page and ours. They will instead link directly to a certain customer experience. Over time, however, we depreciate, move or obsolete whole user experiences, which for certain demanding and lazy partners result in lingering links to unsupported or non-existent items. We also have to handle the case of people mis-typing, mis-remembering, mis-linking, revisiting from their browser history or just trying random urls.</p>\n\n<p>These latter cases have resulted in some nasty exceptions in the <code>LayoutResolverPipeline</code>. I am trying to resolve these exceptions by having it fall back to the <code>LaunchHandler</code> if it can't figure out what to do. I have this implemented as a Redirect, but I would like to simply invoke the <code>LaunchHandler</code> directly; it is going to do a 301 to a different item, anyways, and having multiple redirects on a single request is a costly waste of resources that I would like to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>Enough background. The problem is that <code>LayoutResolverPipeline</code> is bound to the <code>HttpBeginRequest</code> portion of the IIS processing stack, which is well before the Session information is ready. This is a constraint of Sitecore's and it can't be moved without solving a whole load of other problems. </p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a way to pass control to a specific <code>IHttpHandler</code> other than redirecting to the URL it is bound to?</li>\n<li>Is there a way to rejoin the code a later point in the event pipeline? I suppose this would mean binding to the <code>Application.PostAcquireRequestState</code> event for a single request only, which sounds ludicrous.</li>\n<li>Is there a way to acquire session state information early?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm of course open to suggestions for how I might be doing it completely wrong. Oh, and if you know of a more useful tag to throw on it for the Asp.net/IIS pipeline specifically, I wasn't able to find one that wasn't a read herring.

When I fill the textbox in, the validator shows valid which is correct; the Text property is no longer displayed and the validatorsummary no longer shows the error. Then when I delete what's in the Textbox and cause a postback (clicking a button) weird stuff happens. The Error Message displays in the Error Message, and when I debug the RequiredFieldValidator .IsValid is false. But the Text Property never shows back up!? I think I might be missing something with the viewstate, maybe the pre render on the RequiredFieldValidator, or the way I am saving/restoring my session state. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried everything I can think of.

A runtime error occurs informing me that the email address is required. I obvioulsy want this validation to be done up front with the data annotations.</p>\n\n<p>How can I accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p>An actual runtime error is coming back saying\nthat the email address should not be NULL when the record tries to be added. This\nis correct. The database column requires a value.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that by having the data annotations in the model, if there is\nsomething wrong with the front end and the model is not valid once the form\ntries to be posted, the corresponding data annotation error should display on\nthe form.

Any ideas how to fix this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","sql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":0,"question_id":13219113,"title":"Import from excel to sql format error","body":"<p>hi I am trying to load data into sql from an excel spreadsheet from a web page, I am getting a  \"Cannot implicitly convert type '<code>string</code>' to '<code>decimal</code>\" error I have tried different ways to correct this but nothing is working.</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace CarpartsStore.Dealers\n{\n\npartial class DealerHome : System.Web.UI.Page\n{\n\n    protected void ButtonUpload_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)\n    {\n        PanelUpload.Visible = true;\n        PanelView.Visible = false;\n        PanelImport.Visible = false;\n    }\n\n\n    protected OleDbCommand ExcelConnection()\n    {\n\n        // Connect to the Excel Spreadsheet\n        string xConnStr = \"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;\" + \"Data Source=\" + Server.MapPath(\"~/ExcelImport.xls\") + \";\" + \"Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;\";\n\n        // create your excel connection object using the connection string\n        OleDbConnection objXConn = new OleDbConnection(xConnStr);\n        objXConn.Open();\n\n        // use a SQL Select command to retrieve the data from the Excel Spreadsheet\n        // the \"table name\" is the name of the worksheet within the spreadsheet\n        // in this case, the worksheet name is \"Members\" and is coded as: [Members$]\n        OleDbCommand objCommand = new OleDbCommand(\"SELECT * FROM [Products$]\", objXConn);\n        return objCommand;\n\n\n\n    }\n\n    protected void ButtonView_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)\n    {\n        PanelUpload.Visible = false;\n        PanelView.Visible = true;\n        PanelImport.Visible = false;\n\n        // Create a new Adapter\n        OleDbDataAdapter objDataAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter();\n\n        // retrieve the Select command for the Spreadsheet\n        objDataAdapter.SelectCommand = ExcelConnection();\n\n        // Create a DataSet\n        DataSet objDataSet = new DataSet();\n        // Populate the DataSet with the spreadsheet worksheet data\n        objDataAdapter.Fill(objDataSet);\n\n        // Bind the data to the GridView\n        GridViewExcel.DataSource = objDataSet.Tables[0].DefaultView;\n        GridViewExcel.DataBind();\n    }\n\n\n    protected void ButtonImport_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)\n    {\n        PanelUpload.Visible = false;\n        PanelView.Visible = false;\n        PanelImport.Visible = true;\n        LabelImport.Text = \"\";\n        // reset to blank\n\n        // retrieve the Select Command for the worksheet data\n        OleDbCommand objCommand = new OleDbCommand();\n        objCommand = ExcelConnection();\n\n        //  create a DataReader\n        OleDbDataReader reader;\n        reader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();\n\n\n        //  create variables for the spreadsheet columns\n        int ProductID = 0;\n        int MakeID = 0;\n        int DealerID = 0;\n        string PartNumber = \"\";\n        string Description = \"\";\n        decimal UnitCost = 0.00M;\n        decimal Postage = 0.00M;\n        int QtyAvailable = 0;\n        string UserName = \"\";\n        string Make = \"\";\n\n\n        int counter = 0;\n        // used for testing your import in smaller increments\n\n        while (reader.Read())\n        {\n            counter = counter + 1;\n            // counter to exit early for testing...\n\n            // set default values for loop\n            ProductID = 0;\n            MakeID = 0;\n            DealerID = 0;\n\n\n\n            PartNumber = GetValueFromReader(reader,\"PartNumber\");\n            Description = GetValueFromReader(reader,\"Description\");\n\n\n            UnitCost = GetValueFromReader(reader,\"UnitCost\");\n            Postage = GetValueFromReader(reader, \"Postage\");

All the applications/links etc. does work, but I don't want such a path in my URLs. Such as, when I'm directory browsing, all the files under <code>http://backend.mysite.com</code> appear as links to <code>http://backend.mysite.com/backend/file1.txt</code> etc. (notice the extra <code>backend</code> in the path). I also have a similar rule for <code>apps</code>, and for example, when I go to <code>http://apps.mysite.com/myapp</code>, I am redirected to <code>http://apps.mysite.com/apps/myapp</code>. It works, the site opens and runs perfectly, but I don't want that extra path. More weirdly, if I explicitly remove that path after opening the site and write <code>http://apps.mysite.com/myapp</code> (yes, just as I've written before), then my site DOES open at my desired path, <code>http://apps/mysite.com/myapp</code>, without redirection. These rules have long been in my <code>web.config</code> and I didn't really have the time to investigate, and I don't actually remember where I got these from. I'm not a regex master, nor an ASP.NET Rewriting master, so could someone correct what is wrong at my rules?

I really don't want to have to go back and change my object models to account for a key that I will only need every once in awhile.</p>\n\n<p>This is an ASP.NET MVC4 project, and it is going back to a web api controller if that matters.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: here is my server side stuff</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public HttpResponseMessage PostNew(Project project, int id)\n    {\n        //TODO grab the client to add the project to\n        Uow.Projects.Add(project);\n        Uow.Commit();\n\n        HttpResponseMessage response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, project);\n        //response.Headers.Location = new Uri(Url.Link(\"ApiControllerAction\", new { id = client.ID }));\n        return response;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Maybe I am not being clear enough. I want to pass in the project object, and then just an int variable. Passing project alone works, but if I try to pass the int it gives me a 400 error</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":543,"score":0,"question_id":7072262,"title":"Box Plot Chart in ASP.NET and C#","body":"<p>I am trying to generate a Box Plot Chart in ASP.NET with C#. i did the regular bar chart but not the box plot chart the idea is to generate the chart like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SL4e.png\" alt=\"fig1\"></p>\n\n<p>I  did the search online but there are not any good tutorials about box plot chart and it modification I would highly appreciate if someone could show me how to do this or point me to the right direction. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","web-config","app-config"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13204197,"title":"ServiceSoapClient() access from Class Library from Web Application","body":"<p>I have a library that I use across multiple web applications.

Now, if I fire up the site and simply click the confirm button only the first two fields trigger their validation, that is the first and last name fields. Now, if I put in a first and last name and click confirm button again the rest of the validators trigger as normal. How can I get them to all trigger at once?

I'm led to believe this because there's a <code>IAsyncResult result</code> object that is passed into the callback function and when I examine its <code>CompletedSynchronously</code> property it's always set to true. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if it's possible to do an async HttpWebRequest (with no wait) from within an ASP.NET web application or is it always converted to a synchronous request?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","wcf","iis","iis7","url-rewriting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":2,"question_id":12534543,"title":"IIS 7 URL Redirect based on URL path","body":"<p>I have a WCF Web Service hosted inside a ASP.NET 4 environment (IIS 7.5 on Windows 7), and I would like to use URL Rewriting / Redirection. \nThe reason I need to do this is because I can't change some mobile device code to just insert the parameter.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the URL I want:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://server.test.com/VirtualDirectory/theOrganization/RequestService.svc/REST/GetIssueTypes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://server.test.com/VirtualDirectory/theOrganization/RequestService.svc/REST/GetIssueTypes</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The real URL is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://server.test.com/VirtualDirectory/RequestService.svc/REST/GetIssueTypes?organization=theOrganization\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://server.test.com/VirtualDirectory/RequestService.svc/REST/GetIssueTypes?organization=theOrganization</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice how I want to remove theOrganization and appended it to the Query string for redirection.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;rule name=\"test\" stopProcessing=\"true\"&gt;\n    &lt;match url=\"(.+\\.?)/(.+)/RequestService.svc/(.+)\" /&gt;\n    &lt;action type=\"Redirect\" url=\"{R:1}/RequestService.svc/{R:3}?organization={R:2}\"\n    redirectType=\"Permanent\" /&gt;\n&lt;/rule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know it's a little odd of a rule to write.

But here the ID for any selection of the dropdown list passes \"null\" as the value onto the controller .</p>\n\n<p>My view</p>\n\n<pre><code>@using Kendo.Mvc.UI\n@model ExamplekendoDropdown.Models.FacilityGroup\n\n@{\n    ViewBag.Title = \"FacilityGroup\";\n}\n\n&lt;h2&gt;FacilityGroup&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n@using (Html.BeginForm())\n{\n    @Html.ValidationSummary(true)\n\n    &lt;fieldset&gt;\n        &lt;legend&gt;FacilityGroup&lt;/legend&gt;\n\n        &lt;div id=\"RegionName\"  class=\"editor-label\"&gt;\n            @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.RegionId)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-field\"&gt;\n           @* @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.RegionName)*@\n           @(Html.Kendo().DropDownList()\n          .Name(\"Region\")\n          .DataTextField(\"RegionName\")\n          .DataValueField(\"RegionId\")\n          .DataSource(source =&gt;\n          {\n              source.Read(read =&gt;\n              {\n                  read.Action(\"GetRegion\", \"Fill\");\n              });\n\n          })\n    )\n            @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.RegionId)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;div id=\"Rest\"&gt;\n@*&lt;form method=\"post\" action='@Url.Action(\"Submit\")' style=\"width:45%\"&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        @(Html.Kendo().Upload()\n            .Name(\"files\")\n        )\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" class=\"k-button\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;*@\n\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-label\"&gt;\n            @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.FaclityGroupName)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-field\"&gt;\n            @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.FaclityGroupName)\n            @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.FaclityGroupName)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-label\"&gt;\n            @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.status)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-field\"&gt;\n            @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.status)\n            @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.status)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-label\"&gt;\n            @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.CreationDate)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"editor-field\"&gt;\n          @*  @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.CreationDate)*@\n          @(Html.Kendo().DatePicker()\n              .Name(\"datepicker\")\n              .Value(\"17/08/2011\")\n              .HtmlAttributes(new { style = \"width:150px\" })\n        )\n            @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.CreationDate)\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n}\n        &lt;div&gt;\n        @Html.ActionLink(\"See the List\", \"List\")\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n    @Html.ActionLink(\"Back to List\", \"About\")\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    $(document).ready(function () {\n\n        $(\"#RegionName\").click(function () {\n            $(\"#Rest\").show();\n        });\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n@section Scripts {\n    @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Controller :-</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Web.Mvc;\nusing ExamplekendoDropdown.Models;\n\nnamespace ExamplekendoDropdown.Controllers\n{\n    public class FacilityGroupController : Controller\n    {\n        //\n        // GET: /FacilityGroup/\n\n        public ActionResult FacilityGroup()\n        {\n            return View();\n        }\n        [HttpPost]\n        public ActionResult FacilityGroup(FacilityGroup objadd)\n        {\n            AMIEntities1 obj1 = new AMIEntities1();\n            Facility objtbl = new Facility();\n\n                objtbl.RegionId = Convert.ToInt16(objadd.RegionId);\n                objtbl.FaclityGroupName = objadd.FaclityGroupName.ToString();\n                objtbl.Status = objadd.status;\n                objtbl.CreationDate = objadd.CreationDate;\n\n                obj1.AddToFacilities(objtbl);\n                obj1.SaveChanges();\n                obj1.AcceptAllChanges();\n\n\n            return View();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Kindly help !!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","asp.net"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":13191511,"title":"Accessing different check boxes in grid","body":"<p>I have a grid with two checkbox columns.\nI want to have separate count for each column.

Yslow recommends combining all of your external javascripts, if possible. I've actually taken internal javascripts and made them into an external .js file and put it in my /scripts folder, per some recommendation I found on some website.  But this leads me to my 2 (similar) questions; I didn't think separate posts were needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(1)</strong> - How would I combine javascript codes?  Just leave a blank line and then copy and paste the other javascript after the other, and so on, until it's all in one file?</p>\n\n<p><strong>(2)</strong> - I have an asp.net website with 5 master pages.  4 of the 5 have 6 javascript files (all minified, some on my own using some compression tool that worked).  But I read on a SE post and online that you should load the script(s) <strong>after page load</strong>.  How do you do this on an asp.net website?  All my .js files are in the \n\n<p>@bluesmoon gave a nice, thorough answer, but I wasn't able to comprehend it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>To load a script after page load, do something like this:\n\n// This function should be attached to your onload handler\n// it assumes a variable named script_url exists.  You could easily\n// extend it to use an array of scripts or figure it out some other\n// way (see note late)\nfunction lazy_load() {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n            var s = document.createElement(\"script\");\n            s.src=script_url;\n            document.body.appendChild(s);\n        }, 50);\n}\n\nThis is called from onload, and sets a timeout for 50ms later at which point it will \nadd a new script node to the document's body. The script will start downloading after \nthat. Now since javascript is single threaded, the timeout will only fire after onload \nhas completed even if onload takes more than 50ms to complete.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't really understand what he's saying or how to go about implementing it.  So that's all ... I just need help in <strong>combining javascripts</strong> and loading them (or it) <strong>after page load</strong>; I don't see anything saying \"onload\" in my master pages or .aspx pages.

I'll be writing this byte stream to the response, so do I need to write the word document bytes, then pause while I write the image bytes, and then continue writing the word document bytes?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Answered my own question using this post: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2644542/outputting-a-byte-arrain-into-the-src-attribute-of-an-img-tag\">Outputting a byte arrain into the src attribute of an img tag</a></p>\n\n<p>Another Edit: The post listed above allowed me to write the html out correctly and it opens the word document in a web browser just fine, but when I try to open the resulting html document in Word, the image still shows as a red X like the image is missing.  Back to square one...  Any ideas out there?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13184094,"title":"Paging and searching","body":"<p>I have a <code>listview</code> with a search function and a pager.

So my questions are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Do I really need AJAX to use the background worker?</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>If yes</strong>, I do need AJAX, what is the easiest, most simplest way a person that doesn't know a darn thing about AJAX could do to get the Background worker up and running on an ASP.NET webpage?</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>If no</strong>, I don't need AJAX, can anyone point me to a working sample that doesn't use it? I am interested even if it uses some other threading method than background workers.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the multi-part question! If you can answer one or the other, it would be much appreciated. I don't really mind which method I end up using as long as it works.</p>\n\n<p>Code for reference from the .cs page:</p>\n\n<pre><code> protected void bwProcess_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n { \n     lblProgress.Text = \"Task Complete: \" + e.Result;\n }\n\n protected void bwProcess_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)\n {\n     lblProgress.Text = e.ProgressPercentage.ToString();\n }\n\n protected void bwProcess_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)\n {\n     for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++)\n     {\n         if (bwProcess.CancellationPending)\n         {\n             lblProgress.Text = \"Task Cancelled.\";\n             e.Cancel = true;\n             return;\n         }\n         bwProcess.ReportProgress(i);\n         Thread.Sleep(50);\n     }\n     e.Result = \"100%\";\n}\n\nprotected void BWClick(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    lblProgress.Text = \"Firing Process...\";\n    bwProcess = new BackgroundWorker();\n    bwProcess.WorkerReportsProgress = true;\n    bwProcess.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true;\n    bwProcess.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(bwProcess_DoWork);\n    bwProcess.ProgressChanged += new ProgressChangedEventHandler(bwProcess_ProgressChanged);\n    bwProcess.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(bwProcess_RunWorkerCompleted);\n\n    if (bwProcess != null)\n    {\n        bwProcess.RunWorkerAsync(\"StartAsynchronousProcess\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Other notes: I have entered Async=\"True\" and EnableSessionState=\"ReadOnly\" into the @Page.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","eval"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":695,"score":4,"question_id":7446837,"title":"ASP.NET Eval() problem displaying two columns if Eval() != null","body":"<p>I want to display an additional <code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;?# Eval(\"DataValue\") %&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</code> if the value of another Eval() data item is not null.</p>\n\n<p>I have the following aspx:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   &lt;%# Eval(TwoColumns).ToString() == null ? \" \" : Eval(Column2Data).ToString() %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this possible?

I'm using something like a service-architecture to perform DB operations - that is invoke relevant LINQ operations. I've a service class for almost every entity (i.e. DB table) and it handles the CRUD operations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In general, I need to track activities\n  like - Mr.X added a new Item, My.Y\n  searched on this filter, Mr.Z exported\n  the result of Grid to an excel\n  document, etc... and similar simple\n  operation based logging (field-level\n  logging is far for now)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, here's what I've found in my two days of R&amp;D on the SO, other forums and the web:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Approach 1:</strong>\nSimple old way of using two tables: Activity (stores ALL the activities along with its actor) &amp; ActivityType (lists types of activities). I've a service layer so either I can have a \"ServieBase\" class which taps ALL the CRUD events and logs the one in which I'm interested.

This will be completely 'abstract' to the app. I've \"LastModifiedBy\" field in each table so I'll get the 'actor' data and I can do the logging but this might limit me to DB-operations &amp; need me to track other app-activities separately. but if its worth I can consider it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Approach 3:</strong> (conceptual, need more guidance)</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.1 MVC approach</strong> - We're thinking of adopting MVC in future and I've found some efficient logging tricks in MVC like - (is ther anything like that for traditional L2S based web-app?)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1822754/log-user-activity-on-asp-net-mvc-application\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1822754/log-user-activity-on-asp-net-mvc-application</a>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1514616/track-user-activity-actions-for-an-asp-net-mvc-website\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1514616/track-user-activity-actions-for-an-asp-net-mvc-website</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>3.2 Tracking Services</strong> I came across a 'tracking service' feature in windows - is there its web-equivalent?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163466.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163466.aspx</a>\n  <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WF/WWF%5F%5FTracking%5FService.aspx?msg=2879654\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WF/WWF%5F%5FTracking%5FService.aspx?msg=2879654</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3.3 Misc</strong> - Some other options which I came across but don't seem too convincing or I'd better say they do their work but not mine :-)</p>\n\n<p>Ref - </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/480/sample-web-analytics-tracking-module/\">http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/480/sample-web-analytics-tracking-module/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SQL Profiler: \n  <a href=\"http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878%5F11-5054787.html\">http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878%5F11-5054787.html</a>\n  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc966515.aspx\">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc966515.aspx</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, what say?

So I need to update a session variable (stored in SQL) every time a user logs in or out. So the session ID could always be different. Is this possible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Created two new sites in IIS (Site1 and Site2)</li>\n<li>Created two new Web Application projects in VS 2010 (Site1 and Site2)</li>\n<li>In both sites, on the Default.aspx page, I created a button that when clicked will save either \"Site1\" or \"Site2\" (depending on the site) into a session variable called \"LastSiteUsed\". There's another button, that when clicked, will read the value from the \"LastSiteUsed\" session variable and display it in a label.</li>\n<li>In SQL, I created a new Database called dbSessionTest. Then I followed the instructions on <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN to install the Session State Database using the aspnet_regsql tool</a>.</li>\n<li>In both of my Web Application's Web.config file, I've added the following under <code>&lt;System.Web&gt;</code>: </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"server=.\\sqlexpress;database=dbSessionTest;uid=myUsername;pwd=myPassword\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"20\" allowCustomSqlDatabase=\"true\"/&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Both sites function normally, but they don't seem to be <em>sharing</em> the session. For example, when I click my button to save my session variable from Site1, I'd expect to be able to read that value from Site2, but it doesn't work. Site2 will only return \"Site2\" and Site1 will only return \"Site1\". </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas on what I could be doing wrong? Am I wrong in thinking that I should be able to read a value set by Site1 from Site2?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can see that session data is getting stored in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table in SQL Management Studio, but each site can still only see the value which it wrote. Both sites are setting the session variable like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Session(\"LastSiteUsed\") = \"Site2\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And both sites are retrieving the value like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lblValue.Text = \"Value from Session: \" &amp; Session(\"LastSiteUsed\").ToString\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do I need to do this differently for accessing session variables stored in SQL Server?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've tried using the default database, ASPState, which is created by running this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aspnet_regsql.exe -S MyServerName -E -ssadd -sstype p\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then simplified each of my Web.config files like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"20\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But again, no luck. I want to be able to set a session variable from Site1 and then read the value from Site2, but it's not working. Again, I'm able to see entries showing up in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table so I know they're getting entered correctly. One thing I noticed is they have different session IDs? </p>\n\n<p>Is there something I need to be doing differently to ensure the same session ID is used between my sites when setting/reading the same session variable?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've followed the instructions from <strong><a href=\"http://www.stionasoftware.com/Blogs/post/2010/10/27/Sharing-NET-Session-across-multiple-applications.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a></strong> which modifies an SP and adds a column for grouping to the <code>ASPStateTempApplications</code> table. This <em>kind of</em> worked, but only if both of my sites were open in the same browser (using tabs). I need to be able to open Site1 in IE, save a value to my session variable, close the browser, open Site2 in Chrome, and read the value. From everything I've read with SQL Server Session State... this should be possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4 - SOLUTION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I followed the answer on <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2868316/sharing-sessions-across-applications-using-the-asp-net-session-state-service/3151315#3151315\">this article</a></strong> provided by @SilverNinja. I re-created the <code>ASPState</code> database via the command prompt (to undo my SP changes in Update #3) and then modified the <code>TempGetAppID</code> SP as per the answer from the link. I've also updated both of my Web.config files to match the answer from that article as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\"\n              sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword;Application Name=CacheTest\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also included identical Machine Keys in both Web.config files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;machineKey validationKey=\"59C42C5AB0988049AB0555E3F2128061AE9B75E3A522F25B34A21A46B51F188A5C0C1C74F918DFB44C33406B6E874A54167DFA06AC3BE1C3FEE8506E710015DB\" decryptionKey=\"3C98C7E33D6BC8A8C4B7D966F42F2818D33AAB84A81C594AF8F4A533ADB23B97\" validation=\"SHA1\" decryption=\"AES\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I am able to (using IE) open up both of my sites, set a value from Site1, and read it from Site2 (and vice versa).

The jQuery call is for all checkboxes found in the page.</p>\n\n<p>This is working fine, and the jQuery call works as expected.

The code is below.</p>\n\n<pre><code> public static bool IsAuthenticated(string srvr, string usr, string pwd)\n        {\n            bool authenticated = false;\n\n            try\n            {\n                DirectoryEntry deRoot = new DirectoryEntry(srvr);\n\n                DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry(srvr, usr, pwd);\n                object nativeObject = entry.NativeObject;//this will cause exception Until setting the right DNS address.\n                authenticated = true;\n            }\n            catch (DirectoryServicesCOMException cex)\n            {\n                //not authenticated; reason why is in cex\n                HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(cex.Message);\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                //not authenticated due to some other exception [this is optional]\n                HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(ex.Message);\n            }\n\n            return authenticated;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One day as our IT environment requirement changed, My computer IP is switched from 10.50.70.64 to 169.254.135.249. Because my net adapter IP and DNS always set to <code>Obtain address automatically</code>.In this case , I can log in my computer using the AD account successfully. But the program run with a big fat exception. So I doubted if there is something wrong with my Net Adapter settings. Finally I found If I set the right DNS address of our IT environment. The Exception was gone. I don't know why. So I also hope someone can explain more about it.

The year selector bar stretches across the entire screen, and changing the year doesn't do anything for the calendar. </p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find any similar problems in my research, so I am not sure what to try.

I have also tried not including the calendar in the UpdatePanels, which will not \"break\" the calendars, but it will put two new TextBox fields on my webpage (which will accept any new values from the calendar) and not clear the old ones. Also tried putting both the button and the table containing the calendar in the same UpdatePanel, but I get the same red box there too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","asp.net","asp.net-ajax","scriptmanager"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":11282621,"title":"asp.net IScriptControl $create order","body":"<p>I have two script controls (code is very simplified):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Form : IScriptControl\n{\n      Panel pnl;\n      Button trigger;\n      public Form()\n      {\n           pnl = new Panel();\n           trigger = new Button();\n\n           IPresenter p = new Popup();\n           p.SetContent(this.pnl);           \n           this.Controls.Add(trigger);\n      }\n}\n\nclass Popup : IScriptControl, IPresenter\n{\n      public void SetContent(Control content)\n      {\n           this.Controls.Add(content);\n      }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now in the HTML output, i see the following (again very simplified):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"ctrlForm\"&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"ctrlPopup\"&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"ctrlFormPnl\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"ctrlFormTrigger\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sys.Application.add_init(function() {\n    $create(Form, {\"_presenter\":\"FormPresenter\"}, null, null, $get(\"ctrlForm\"));\n});\nSys.Application.add_init(function() {\n    $create(Popup, {\"_isOpen\":false}, null, null, $get(\"ctrlPopup\"));\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Question: How I can do, that the script that creates the popup appears on page before script of form...in other words, when initializer of the ctrlForm control executes, I want to get reference to forms presenter.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I clearly explained what I want to do.

Im not anything in research so far that indicates one way or the other.\nThanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","image","3d"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":1,"question_id":13163177,"title":"How can i apply such an effect to an image dynamically in .net?","body":"<p>So I want to create thumbnails of images uploaded in my asp.net applications to look like this.
