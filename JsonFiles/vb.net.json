When I scan something i wait 100ms, then spit out the data in string form. Simple as could be. The difference between my code and the other one that works flawlesly is that I have to get the pointer. To turn on my scanner i need a pointer to the comport using IntPtr. C# I use IntPtr, in VB i use SafeFileHandle. Both have the same error. The only time the error occurs is when a data event is fired. This is why I think it has to be with the handle.

This way I can literally copy this code to any other class and it will work unmodified.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried creating a property that returns the type of the class and using that, which predictably failed. I tried using TypeOf, Me, even 'this' on a long shot and nothing worked. It seems there has to be a way for the compiler to know this based on this error message which I get when I change the last sub to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Protected Sub NotifyPropertyChanged(Of TResult)(propertyExpr As Expression(Of Func(Of TResult)))\n    NotifyPropertyChanged(Me.GetPropertySymbol(propertyExpr))\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in extension method 'Public Function GetPropertySymbol(Of TResult)(expr As System.Linq.Expressions.Expression(Of System.Func(Of CustInfo, TResult))) As String' defined in 'CustClasses.Extensions' cannot be inferred from these arguments. Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.\n</code></p>\n\n<p>The extension method being referred to is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Extension()&gt;\nPublic Function GetPropertySymbol(Of T, TResult)(obj As T, expr As Expression(Of Func(Of T, TResult))) As String\n    Return DirectCast(expr.Body, MemberExpression).Member.Name\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, as you can see the compiler correctly inferred what is going on, but still couldn't work with it. The only type that seems unknown is TResult, but that type should be easily inferred based on the other information in the extension method that is known.</p>\n\n<p>It may be impossible to generically specify a class type in the procedure definition, in which case I'll modify the code every time I use it, but I'd rather not and learn something new in the process.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","json","vba","dictionary","converter"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13271189,"title":"Convert Dictionary to JSON in VBA","body":"<p>I need to convert a large JSON Dictionary (which is of type string (if I'm not mistaken))</p>\n\n<p>I was fine all the net return I've found plenty of converter between different types but never Dictionary -> Json\nThe second problem is that I do not have a level sufficient to encode a converter (I just started using VBA)</p>\n\n<p>Is there a function dedicated to this manipulation?

But when I try to send an email from the site to a Gmail address, I get the following error:</p>\n\n<p>550 Authentication is required for relay</p>\n\n<p>In the code-behind for the ASP.NET page that is sending the email, I have the following VB.NET code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim MailObj As New SmtpClient\nWith MailObj\n  .Credentials = New NetworkCredential(MailFromEmailAddress, Password)\n  .EnableSsl = False\n  .Host = \"mail.MyDomain.com\" ' our mail server subdomain name, configured in IIS\n  .Timeout = 180000\n  .UseDefaultCredentials = False\nEnd With\n\nMailObj.Send(OrderMailMsg)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can log in to SmarterMail with the MailFromEmailAddress and Password without any problems.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I can define an SMTP Authentication Bypass for the IP address of the mail server, and then the email to the Gmail address goes through fine. But I cannot get the SMTP authentication to work when sending to an address outside our domain from our site.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an idea of what I should change or do to make this work? Thanks very much!</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13243735,"title":"matrix with visal basic - find a column which has specific values","body":"<p><strong>I have built a matrix using visual basic and I want search for the column that has values 0 or 1 (binary column) in that matrix \nthank you for advance answer</strong> </p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","asp.net-mvc-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":303,"score":0,"question_id":8536262,"title":"Putting a hidden column in WebGrid MVC3","body":"<p>I want to put some hidden columns in the Webgrid. there a few key columns in my output which are not to be shown to the users but I need them to be present in the webgrid.

Is there any account that I can impersonate to get this working? </p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","generics","lambda"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":2,"question_id":13234620,"title":"How can we query on a generic columnName?","body":"<p>So far we have a method (OnSearchButtonClick) which searches on the tenantName column:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub OnSearchButtonClick(ByVal searchValue As String)\n            _filteredTenants = New ListCollectionView(_allTenants.Cast(Of TenantOverviewDto).Where(Function(p) p.TenantName.ToUpper().StartsWith(searchValue.ToUpper())).ToList())\n End Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this method we want to pass another string as a parameter with the name of a certain column of TenantOverviewDto.\nFor example if we want to look for a tennant in a group called \"Runners\" we want to pass \"Runners\" in the searchValue parameter and group in the new parameter and then execute a query which looks in the group column.\n(If the second parameter is TenantName we should look in the TenantName column)</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an idea of how we can accomplish this?

What is basically is, is a horse meeting, which contains it's races and the horses which ran in each race.</p>\n\n<p>I'm used to working with and seperating .csv files and have secured that, but the way things are going it's looking like I'm going to have to begin reading XML files and updating the database accordingly. Anyway, I'm a beginner to XML and vb .NET as a whole (a few month experience) and should probably not be jumping into such a complicated XML file so early on - I'll post my code below, and if somebody could point me in the right direction as to where I'm going wrong (probably a lot) and possibly provide me with some code/tutorials that will help me tackle this XML file then it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking to do is populate three different structures; Meeting, Race and Horse, with the corresponding information from the XML file.

My boss asked me to set the tab order, and then trap keypress so the user can use enter to navigate controls. I have 2 apps like this to work on.</p>\n\n<p>For the tab order, I could not use the View/TabOrder feature, since there are so many blue little tabindex popups showing, that I can not see any of the controls on the form to click. I tried clicking 'through' the popup with some success, but it still did not give me the tab order I wanted. The tab assistant that came with CodeSMART did not give me the result I wanted, either, so I could use it. </p>\n\n<p>The controls on this usercontrol are spread among many groups, which in turn are spread among several splitcontainer panels. The 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupboxes which are selected via a toolstripbutton ( which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible.) </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub ShowMainPanel()\n    'Note: Panels are groupboxes\n    Me.MaterialPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.HaulPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.MainPanel.Visible = True\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each of these groupboxes contain more groupboxes, each of which contain 1 to 15 controls. Some are read only, but others need information from the user. The required controls have their tab stop set to true.</p>\n\n<p>So I MANUALLY set each of the main group panels tabindexes as 0 thru 2. Then for the 1st groupbox(mainpanel), I set the tabindex for each of it's controls and groupboxes that are contained within. The non-container type controls have their tabindexes set to 0 thru 25, and then the groupboxes (sub groups) on the mainpanel are 26 thru 48. I then went to each control in these sub groups and set tab index for those controls starting at 0 thru Control.count-1 for the group. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, my tab orders look like this (abbreviated):</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainPanel = 0\n  1st fields = 0.0\n  2ndfield = 0.1\n  3rd field = 0.2\n  1st group = 0.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.1\n  2nd group = 0.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.1\nmaterialPanel = 1\n  1st fields = 1.0\n  2ndfield = 1.1\n  3rd field = 1.2\n  1st group = 1.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.1\n  2nd group = 1.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: I did not actually enter, for instance, 1.4.0 for a tabindex, but 0 for the control, 4 for the sub group and 1 for main group.</p>\n\n<p>I then set the zorder via the Document Outline panel in based on the tab order.</p>\n\n<p>Once I did all of this I was finally able to get the tab order I wanted to work for the mainpanel. </p>\n\n<p>But when I applied the same to the other 2 groupboxes (materialPanel and haulpanel), the tabs are completely ignored. Tab does not work at all within the app. for the 2nd to main groupboxes (MaterialPanel and HaulPanel). The app is Control Library so I use the built in UserTestContainer when debugging, and when one of the 2nd 2 groupboxes are showing, the tab key moves the focus out of the app and into the test container. </p>\n\n<p>This does not happen when on the 1st groupbox (MainPanel). It works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Setting this stuff out took me about 3-4 hours to tedious work. Due to the number of controls, this application is hard to work with, as anytime a change is made to the form designer, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to process it.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a clue about what's going on here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net",".net","vb.net","events"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":1,"question_id":13217704,"title":"What are scenarios that trigger Application_End event?","body":"<p>Asp.net has an <code>Application_End</code> event which occurs when the application comes to end, like this<br/></p>\n\n<pre><code>void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is the following: when does this event occurs in real, i.e. what kind of situations trigger it?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have a banking web application running <code>24x7x365</code>, which executes continuously &amp; accesses from thousands of places at a time, then when would this <code>Application_End</code> event occur?

I really don't want anything more than absolutely necessary in the code (no titles, captions, headings, etc.), and I need it to be fairly efficient (the csv array is approx. ~1000 x ~1000).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","vb.net","compression"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":2,"question_id":13052431,"title":"compress a byte array with vb.net","body":"<p>i want to compress a byte array with vb.net </p>\n\n<p>a try this code But the results are very bad</p>\n\n<p>Array size :\nBefore compression 32768\nAfter compression 42737</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static byte[] Compress(byte[] data)\n    {\n        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();\n        DeflateStream ds = new DeflateStream(ms, CompressionMode.Compress);\n        ds.Write(data, 0, data.Length);\n        ds.Flush();\n        ds.Close();\n        return ms.ToArray();\n    }\n    public static byte[] Decompress(byte[] data)\n    {\n        const int BUFFER_SIZE = 256;\n        byte[] tempArray = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];\n        List&lt;byte[]&gt; tempList = new List&lt;byte[]&gt;();\n        int count = 0, length = 0;\n\n        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(data);\n        DeflateStream ds = new DeflateStream(ms, CompressionMode.Decompress);\n\n        while ((count = ds.Read(tempArray, 0, BUFFER_SIZE)) &gt; 0)\n        {\n            if (count == BUFFER_SIZE)\n            {\n                tempList.Add(tempArray);\n                tempArray = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                byte[] temp = new byte[count];\n                Array.Copy(tempArray, 0, temp, 0, count);\n                tempList.Add(temp);\n            }\n            length += count;\n        }\n\n        byte[] retVal = new byte[length];\n\n        count = 0;\n        foreach (byte[] temp in tempList)\n        {\n            Array.Copy(temp, 0, retVal, count, temp.Length);\n            count += temp.Length;\n        }\n\n        return retVal;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}\n}\n pls can you tell why this happened with me ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","linq","stored-procedures"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13163450,"title":"Stored Procedures using LINQ with VB.Net","body":"<p>Newby here and I cant understand why the data isnt staying in the table.</p>\n\n<p>The Stored Procedure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.AccountAdd\n\n        @AccountName nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Address1 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Address2 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Address3 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Town nvarchar(50)\n       ,@County nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Postcode nvarchar(10)\n       ,@Phone1 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Phone2 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Phone3 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Email1 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Email2 nvarchar(50)\n       ,@ContactName nvarchar(50)\n       ,@Position nvarchar(50)\n       ,@AccountType nvarchar(50)\n       AS\nINSERT INTO [dbo].[Accounts]\n       ([AccountName]\n       ,[Address1]\n       ,[Address2]\n       ,[Address3]\n       ,[Town]\n       ,[County]\n       ,[Postcode]\n       ,[Phone1]\n       ,[Phone2]\n       ,[Phone3]\n       ,[Email1]\n       ,[Email2]\n       ,[ContactName]\n       ,[Position]\n       ,[AccountType])\n VALUES\n       (@AccountName\n       ,@Address1\n       ,@Address2\n       ,@Address3\n       ,@Town\n       ,@County\n       ,@Postcode\n       ,@Phone1\n       ,@Phone2\n       ,@Phone3\n       ,@Email1\n       ,@Email2\n       ,@ContactName\n       ,@Position\n       ,@AccountType)\n RETURN @@IDENTITY\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The VB Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim db As New DBClassesDataContext\n\n\nPrivate Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    db.Connection.Open()\n    Dim q = db.AccountAdd(\"Mark Cooney\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\", \"vv\")\n\n\n    db.Connection.Close()\n    Label1.Text = q\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So when I click button1, q equals a new id but the data isnt there!!</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing please?

My development machine is Windows 7 64-bit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After successfully converting two apps, the third application is crashing at \nrandom places in the code. The exception isn't caught and I have to look at the  Looking at the event log I am seeing Exception \ncode: 0xc0000005 on ntdll.dll, which I believe is a memory access exception. Since the application doesn't always crash in the same place, it is making it tough to track down. I have noticed that a lot of the errors occur during calls to ADODB (not always in the same place or on the same call), but it has also crashed on calls to form.ShowDialog(). </p>\n\n<p>The form where ShowDialog is being called writes some log information to the \nDB using ADODB. Though I haven't been able to confirm, I am guessing the exception within the form.ShowDialog() is happening during one of these ADODB calls. The crashing on the ADODB calls is happening in assemblies that are successfully being used in the other two apps that were converted and it doesn't consistently crash in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>In my research on this I have seen that bad interop can cause this issue. Wondering if the ADODB COM calls are somehow causing the issue in this app even though these calls are fine in the other apps.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the places I've observed calls that are apparently throwing this exception to the event log:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>newing an ADODB.recordset</li>\n<li>Creating a new parameter within a command.append</li>\n<li>connection.open calls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would anyone have any ideas how I can narrow this down to possibly trace the \nissue to its root cause?

Because the graphics engine is relatively simple, you get to spend your time building features into the game and it's possible for one person to quickly build something fun.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a typical screen might look something like this (the @ is the player, # is a wall, the other characters are things like monsters, stairs, and items):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thangorodrim.net/graphics/dumps/dump2.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm an experienced ASP.Net dev and I'm just getting started with Silverlight. Is there a particular approach I should take for this? </p>\n\n<p>To provide some background, in Winforms, most standard approaches are too slow  -- the text ends up updating with a visible, ugly blink. I'm thinking something to do with the Canvas might be appropriate, but even better would be to somehow draw a screen into a buffer and then instantly flip that onto the screen so that it becomes visible instantly. </p>\n\n<p>But I don't really want to mess around with DirectX right now - I'm hoping WPF can get me to where I need to be without a big learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n\n<p><b>Update:</b> So this turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried a lot of different approaches and I was finally able to get it to actually render fast enough, but I think that to make it blazing hot fast you should probably build a sprite map of the font you want to use and work from that instead of trying to use any of the built in font rendering stuff. I didn't do that.</p>\n\n<p>When I got the core rendering engine done, I ended up with some annoying artifacts related to quirks of font rendering (even fixed width fonts are sometimes a liiitle bit wide...), and when I finally worked that out I discovered <a href=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">libtcod</a>, which is a very impressive roguelike engine that has a C# wrapper. That's all console based. I played with it a little and I was blown away. </p>\n\n<p>As of 1.5.1, everything I've touched in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes (which I think they recently ditched), but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there, and that includes several line-of-sight, pathfinding, and even dungeon generation algorithms. It's pretty advanced visually. Have you ever seen an RL like this?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/files/screenshot0014.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, it's possible to build a roguelike with silverlight, but I wouldn't go in expecting it to be easy unless you've already got a strong silverlight or game dev background. You're going to be re-inventing some serious wheels, and even with a powerful toolkit that allows to focus on gameplay, there's no shortage of things to do.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","modem","gsm"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":4600,"score":1,"question_id":692592,"title":"Call Using GSM modem","body":"<p>I am developing Sms Project in vb.net.I can Send and receive Sms Easily.

What we haven't found as easy to standardize on is Option Compare Text/Binary as there seem to be advantages and disadvantages to both and different developers have differing opinions.  Some of the arguments for each side have been as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Some of the advantages/arguments for Option Compare Text:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It reduces verbosity in the code by removing the need for <code>StringComparer</code>s and <code>.ToLower()</code> calls and <code>StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase</code> all over the place</li>\n<li>Data needs are rarely concerned with casing, as evidenced by most databases being case-insensitive.  Rarely would you ever really want to distinguish between <code>THIS</code> and <code>This</code> and <code>this</code> when doing a data comparison.</li>\n<li>Certain specific use cases are simpler when you don't have to worry about casing.  For example, handling ASP.NET control events where commands are sent to the codebehind as strings and casing-issues are difficult to track down as the compiler cannot help you.  Think <code>Select Case</code> statements for <code>&lt;asp:repeater&gt;</code> events as an example.</li>\n<li>Many of the concerns raised about text comparison concern internationalization, which is often not that relevant to a lot of applications.</li>\n<li>VB specifically is case insensitive as a language, though Visual Studio helps you by at least enforcing consistency in your casing.  SQL is case insensitive as well.  Strings are the only place where you have to remember to worry about it, which highlights the awkwardness in ways you wouldn't normally notice it if you were worried about it everywhere.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some of the advantages/arguments for Option Compare Binary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>C# works this way, as do most other languages.  It's somewhat unexpected to have alternate behavior and the unexpected is not good in programming.</li>\n<li>There is a slight performance penalty with Option Compare Text as evidenced by the IL generated on compile.  Option Compare Binary doesn't have that penalty.</li>\n<li>Option Compare Text only makes certain parts of string handling case insensitive.  But, it doesn't make it so that things like dictionary indexing are case insensitive by default.  So, it's not like Option Compare Text actually makes it so that you don't have to worry about casing at all.  If it only works half way, why bother?</li>\n<li>Programming is hard.  It's best not to attempt to smooth over that fact.  Worrying about string casing is part of the deal.  Humans recognize <code>THIS</code> is different from <code>This</code> and <code>tHiS</code>.  Of course your code should too - after all, they aren't really the exact same string.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I'm really just wondering if there are any other considerations.</p>\n\n<p>-- EDIT 2 --</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it would help if I defined what I'd consider an answer to this.  If you can point to any authoritative external resource that talks through these issues more thoroughly, or point to a standards and best practices discussion or book that gives guidance on this topic, that would certainly count.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","vb6","barcode-scanner","scan"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13097643,"title":"How get scanner list in vb?","body":"<p>I'm writing a piece of code in vb6  to scan documents.

Problem is, I barely know the methods and parameters of the RadioButtonList class at all. So perhaps I should be using some other method? If so, please tell me.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the situation: I have a stripped down default.aspx page. Aside from a  element, almost ALL the functionality has to be in the code-behind in aspx.vb.</p>\n\n<p>The program retreives information from a database, the number of which may vary, it compares this to another list of tables the number of which can also vary.</p>\n\n<p>So I need to \"bind\" a dynamic number of RadioButtonLists to the asp:table element controls, and I need to create a dynamic number of ListItems to each RadioButtonList created. Later, I need to be able to access the selected value of each in order to decide future functions in the database.</p>\n\n<p>An example of the code is like this:</p>\n\n<p>In .aspx:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:table ID=\"table1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><hr/>\nIn .aspx.vb (code-behind)</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sub createHtmlTables()\n\n    For i = 0 To productIndex.Count - 1\n\n        ''//create a RadioButtonList for each i\n        Dim row As New TableRow\n        Dim cell As New TableCell\n\n        For k = 0 To productTypeAmountIndex.Count - 1\n\n            ''//create a ListItem(radiobutton)\n            ''//for each k and include it in the RadioButtonList\n\n            ''//assign a value (for example name) of the product as\n            ''//the ListItems ID to retreive it later\n\n        Next\n\n        ''//add the RadioButtonList to cell.controls etc\n        Table1.Rows.Add(row)\n\n    Next\nEnd Sub\n\nSub addToDb()\n    For i = 0 To productIndex.Count - 1\n        ''//get the RadioButtonList for each i\n        ''//and return the value of the selected radiobutton\n        ''//within the list to a variable\n\n    Next\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sorry if this is long and confusing, but as I can't even form my questions right yet, I tried to include as much information as possible. Basically I just need an example of how and which methods to use to get all that working.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everyone keeps telling me that going for tables to begin with was a mistake, but some place I found claimed that you can't customize datagrid looks as easily as you can with tables. I guess I'll start the whole thing from scratch then.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is that the UI should be as graphically pleasing as possible, with the tables I can do all sorts of neat things such as colouring the cells according to the information inside etc.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thanks but not what I was looking for but I'll try to remake the thing with datagrid / gridview and see what happens.

In so doing, I've noticed a problem when querying with <em>LINQ</em> and <em>Lambda</em> expressions.  Specifically, calling a method within the lambda seems to always make the result set empty and never actually fires the method I'm attempting to filter with.  Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>' Query and filter container results \nPublic Function [Filter](pFilter As IFilter(Of T)) As System.Linq.IQueryable(Of T)\n    ' THIS YIELDS AN EMPTY SET EVEN WHEN pFilter.Test(o) ALWAYS RETURNS TRUE\n    Dim lResult As System.Linq.IQueryable(Of T) = mTable.Where(Function(o As T) pFilter.Test(o))\n\n    Return lResult\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>pFilter implements IFilter with this signature:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Interface IFilter(Of T)\n    Function Test(ByVal pObject As T) As Boolean\nEnd Interface\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've break pointed <code>pFilter.Test(o)</code> and found it is never actually called.

The true nature of this problem stems from my attempting to force a .NET function into something LINQ could turn into an SQL statement (which is impossible).  To solve this, I've changed my IFilter to return System.Linq.Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of T, Boolean)) for the Test method.  Now I can create strongly-typed filters which return predicates and pass them directly to Where() without the use of a lambda expression.  I'm also using <em>LinqKit</em> to make this work more easily for those who may be accomplishing similar tasks.

Something about having to create an instance of objects?  The issue is with the <code>Shared</code>.  Besides I’m not intending to get any output from the function, hence the use of Sub.</p>\n\n<p>Some have suggested that it must be <code>Public Shared Function</code>.  Please advise on why this is so or if there is another way of achieving the same.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","vb.net","wcf","httpcontext"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13071700,"title":"Cant get IP Address From Request WCF","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/391142/how-to-get-the-ip-address-of-a-wcf-remote-endpoint\">How to get the IP address of a WCF remote endpoint?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, we have broken out our API service layer, and have started adding more exposed WCF services. </p>\n\n<p>Our legacy code all used our \"in-house\" solution for emailing errors and exceptions, and we have to put that in the API layer that we are making.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, I just implemented a <strong>IErrorHandler</strong> as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public internal class ErrorHandler:IErrorHandler\n{\n    public void ProvideFault(Exception error, MessageVersion version, ref Message fault)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public bool HandleError(Exception error)\n    {\n        Path.To.Library.CustomError.Handle(error);\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add this error handler behavior, I made a custom service behavior as shown below</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CustomError: Attribute, IServiceBehavior\n{\n    public void Validate(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void AddBindingParameters(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase, Collection&lt;ServiceEndpoint&gt; endpoints, BindingParameterCollection bindingParameters)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n        foreach (ChannelDispatcher c in serviceHostBase.ChannelDispatchers)\n        {\n            c.ErrorHandlers.Add(new ErrorHandler());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything up to this point works fine, and the call to the CustomError.Handle(...) is also being called.</p>\n\n<p>Once the following line is invoked in the <strong>ErrorHandler</strong>, it enters our legacy error handling which handles the error appropriately and emails which additionally is written in VB. (Please do not recommend another error/exception handling mechanism such as elmah because it is not my choice).</p>\n\n<p>Once this is invoked, we have the following lines that are executing pulling information off the HttpContext</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim CTX As System.Web.HttpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current\n\n//More Code...yada yada yada\n\nDim ip = CTX.Request.ServerVariables(\"REMOTE_ADDR\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem we are experiencing is SOMETIMES, we cannot get the IP address. We have tried multiple ways of getting it including REMOTE_HOST and Request.UserHostAddress, but sometimes they are not working when called from our WCF service layer. Anytime this code is called from anywhere else, it works fine and the ip shows up. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we have AspNetCompatibilityMode set to required because we need that in our WCF service.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what would be causing this, but we need to ensure that IP address is available when called from the WCF service. Is there something I have to set in the configuration for WCF to allow it to pass all the right Server Variables?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","application","loops","console","readline"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":1,"question_id":13071593,"title":"vb.net console application only works once","body":"<p>I'm just learning to code in vb.net and am currently messing around with VB.net console applications.
