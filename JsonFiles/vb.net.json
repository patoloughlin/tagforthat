As the clients won't be using, they will be connecting to Azure for server.</p>\n\n<p>Amongst various features, basic features would be:\nmultiple clients (100s) to connect to server\nplayers can see who are online\nany group of 4 players to start a \"game session\"\nleaderboard</p>\n\n<p>I've done some very basic work with WCF and Azure to understand how to get a client use a service on the server.</p>\n\n<p>I can see how this can work for a few things:\nSQL database will provide backbone of all things that are happening on the server. WFC services will be mostly geared at reading/changing SQL database. Clients then simply change or interpret the SQL data accordingly.\nHence:\n1) client can connect to WCF service to login/auth and get a cookie or future ID (at the same time, WCF stores data on SQL database for online users)\n2) client can use WCF service to get list of other players online\n3) client can use WCF service to make other SQL queries (add friends, remove friends)\n4) client can use WCF service to initiate a session \"room\" (SQL)\n5) client can use WCF service to view available session \"rooms\" (SQL) and join the room</p>\n\n<p>However, once the game is ready to begin (through client using WCF service to check their status as ready), I am not clear on how to get the game going. Presumably, when a client needs to interact can still use WCF service to update SQL entries to play/record their turn. However, what happens next? How do other clients receive the update that the other client played his turn? How does the server send this info out to the relevant clients?</p>\n\n<p>I am more concerned about the server-side of things</p>\n\n<p>I know there are technologies such as push notifications, but I am not sure where to head from here, how to implement, where to begin to understand incorporating push notification.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice/resource/link is much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","html-parsing","html-agility-pack","selectsinglenode","selectnodes"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13281827,"title":"Getting width from html using HtmlAgilityPack","body":"<p>Hey all i have the following HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;DIV class=channel_row&gt;&lt;SPAN class=channel&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=logo&gt;&lt;IMG src='/images/channel_logos/WRCB.png'&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WRCB &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style='PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 42px; PADDING-TOP: 0px' class=time&gt;\n&lt;DIV style='MARGIN: 10px'&gt;&lt;A class=thickbox title='Inside Edition' href='/tv/info/?program_id=20474&amp;amp;height=260&amp;amp;width=612' jQuery171012058627296475072='8'&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/A&gt; \n&lt;P class=schedule_flags&gt;&lt;STRONG class=new_flag&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG class=cc_flag&gt;CC&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG class=stereo_flag&gt;Stereo&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style='PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; WIDTH: 490px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 42px; PADDING-TOP: 0px' class=time&gt;\n&lt;DIV style='MARGIN: 10px'&gt;&lt;A class=thickbox title='The Voice' href='/tv/info/?program_id=20475&amp;amp;height=260&amp;amp;width=612' jQuery171012058627296475072='9'&gt;The Voice&lt;/A&gt; \n&lt;P class=schedule_flags&gt;&lt;STRONG class=live_flag&gt;Live&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG class=new_flag&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG class=cc_flag&gt;CC&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG class=stereo_flag&gt;Stereo&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can get a few items right now  (/images/channel_logos/WRCB.png, 3, WRCB, Inside Edition) using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Dim all = New Dictionary(Of String, Object)()\n    For Each channel In doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\".//div[@class='channel_row']\")\n        Dim info = New Dictionary(Of String, Object)()\n\n        With channel\n            info!Logo = .SelectSingleNode(\".//img\").Attributes(\"src\").Value\n            info!Channel = .SelectSingleNode(\".//span[@class='channel']\").ChildNodes(3).ChildNodes(0).InnerText\n            info!Station = .SelectSingleNode(\".//span[@class='channel']\").ChildNodes(3).ChildNodes(2).InnerText\n\n            Dim style As String = .SelectSingleNode(\".//span\").Attributes(\"style\").Value\n\n            info!Shows = From tag In .SelectNodes(\".//a[@class='thickbox']\")\n                         Select New With {.Show = tag.Attributes(\"title\").Value}\n        End With\n\n        all.Add(info!Station, info.Item(\"Shows\"))\n        theLogoURL(theCount) = \"http://epbfi.com\" &amp; Trim(info.Item(\"Logo\"))\n        theChannelNum(theCount) = Trim(info.Item(\"Channel\"))\n        theStationCallLetters(theCount) = Trim(info.Item(\"Station\"))\n\n        Dim Shows As String = \"\"\n        Dim ShowsDetail As String = \"\"\n        Dim tmpShows = all.Item(info!Station)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, i am unable to find the trick to getting the width after <strong>&lt; BR>WRCB &lt; /P>&lt; /SPAN>&lt; SPAN style='PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; WIDTH: 0px;</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm looking to get <strong>WIDTH: 0px;</strong> only.</p>\n\n<p>What can i modify in my code above in order to get that value?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":252,"score":0,"question_id":10337902,"title":"VB.NET Text To Speech and Multiple Languages","body":"<p>I would like to switch between languages at runtime using the microsoft TTS synthesizer (or whatever will work) in a vb.net application on an English version of Windows.

What is basically is, is a horse meeting, which contains it's races and the horses which ran in each race.</p>\n\n<p>I'm used to working with and seperating .csv files and have secured that, but the way things are going it's looking like I'm going to have to begin reading XML files and updating the database accordingly. Anyway, I'm a beginner to XML and vb .NET as a whole (a few month experience) and should probably not be jumping into such a complicated XML file so early on - I'll post my code below, and if somebody could point me in the right direction as to where I'm going wrong (probably a lot) and possibly provide me with some code/tutorials that will help me tackle this XML file then it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking to do is populate three different structures; Meeting, Race and Horse, with the corresponding information from the XML file. I can solve the database updating afterwards by myself, I believe (hopefully) :D</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Sub ExtractionService(ByVal spfile As FileInfo)\n        Dim strreader As New StreamReader(_sendpathname &amp; spfile.Name, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)\n        Dim xmlreader As XmlTextReader = New XmlTextReader(strreader)\n        xmlreader.WhitespaceHandling = WhitespaceHandling.None\n\n        Dim xmldoc As New XmlDocument()\n        xmldoc.Load(xmlreader)\n\n        Dim xml_nodelist As XmlNodeList = xmldoc.GetElementsByTagName(\"/HorseRacingCard/Meeting/Race/Horse\")\n\n        Dim mStatus As String\n        Dim mID As Integer\n        Dim mCountry As String\n        Dim mCourse As String\n        Dim mDate As Integer\n        Dim mDrawAdvantage As String\n        Dim mAdvancedGoing As String\n\n\n        For Each mxmlnode As XmlNode In xmldoc.GetElementsByTagName(\"Meeting\")\n            mStatus = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"status\").InnerText\n            mID = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"id\").InnerText\n            mCountry = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"country\").InnerText\n            mCourse = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"course\").InnerText\n            mDate = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"date\").InnerText\n            mDrawAdvantage = mxmlnode.SelectSingleNode(\"DrawAdvantage\").InnerText\n            mAdvancedGoing = mxmlnode.SelectSingleNode(\"AdvancedGoing\").InnerText\n\n            _meeting.meetingStatus = mStatus\n            _meeting.meetingID = mID\n            _meeting.country = mCountry\n            _meeting.course = mCourse\n            _meeting.meetingDate = mDate\n            _meeting.drawAdvantage = mDrawAdvantage\n            _meeting.advancedGoing = mAdvancedGoing\n        Next\n\n    End Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code manages to populate my meeting structure succesfully, but I just can't figure out I would go about populating the Race and Horse structures :( - I've followed a few tutorials and cannot seem to get my head around it. I understand I'm probably taking the wrong route here, and that there is potentially so much more I need to add/change to this in order for it to function the way I wish. Once these additions and changes have been highlighted, I believe I can then research these areas, and use the code which you guys can hopefully provide me with, to try tackle this.</p>\n\n<p>Again, all help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","vb.net","tsql","ado.net","oledb"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2997,"score":0,"question_id":6414032,"title":"VB.NET Using a SELECT statement to return a row where a DateTime column = variable of type Date?","body":"<p>I am using OleDb, trying to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim d as Date = DateSerial(Year(rptDate), Month(rptDate), 1 - 1)\n\nDim conn as OleDbConnection = new OleDbConnection(connStr)\nDim cm as OleDbCommand = new OleDbCommand()\n\nconn.Open()\ncm.Connection = conn\ncm.CommandText = \"SELECT * FROM history WHERE ReportDate = \" &amp; d\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, so I know it returns 1 row because I'm staring at it in SQL Server.

My boss asked me to set the tab order, and then trap keypress so the user can use enter to navigate controls. I have 2 apps like this to work on.</p>\n\n<p>For the tab order, I could not use the View/TabOrder feature, since there are so many blue little tabindex popups showing, that I can not see any of the controls on the form to click. I tried clicking 'through' the popup with some success, but it still did not give me the tab order I wanted. The tab assistant that came with CodeSMART did not give me the result I wanted, either, so I could use it. </p>\n\n<p>The controls on this usercontrol are spread among many groups, which in turn are spread among several splitcontainer panels. The 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupboxes which are selected via a toolstripbutton ( which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible.) </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub ShowMainPanel()\n    'Note: Panels are groupboxes\n    Me.MaterialPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.HaulPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.MainPanel.Visible = True\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each of these groupboxes contain more groupboxes, each of which contain 1 to 15 controls. Some are read only, but others need information from the user. The required controls have their tab stop set to true.</p>\n\n<p>So I MANUALLY set each of the main group panels tabindexes as 0 thru 2. Then for the 1st groupbox(mainpanel), I set the tabindex for each of it's controls and groupboxes that are contained within. The non-container type controls have their tabindexes set to 0 thru 25, and then the groupboxes (sub groups) on the mainpanel are 26 thru 48. I then went to each control in these sub groups and set tab index for those controls starting at 0 thru Control.count-1 for the group. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, my tab orders look like this (abbreviated):</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainPanel = 0\n  1st fields = 0.0\n  2ndfield = 0.1\n  3rd field = 0.2\n  1st group = 0.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.1\n  2nd group = 0.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.1\nmaterialPanel = 1\n  1st fields = 1.0\n  2ndfield = 1.1\n  3rd field = 1.2\n  1st group = 1.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.1\n  2nd group = 1.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: I did not actually enter, for instance, 1.4.0 for a tabindex, but 0 for the control, 4 for the sub group and 1 for main group.</p>\n\n<p>I then set the zorder via the Document Outline panel in based on the tab order.</p>\n\n<p>Once I did all of this I was finally able to get the tab order I wanted to work for the mainpanel. </p>\n\n<p>But when I applied the same to the other 2 groupboxes (materialPanel and haulpanel), the tabs are completely ignored. Tab does not work at all within the app. for the 2nd to main groupboxes (MaterialPanel and HaulPanel). The app is Control Library so I use the built in UserTestContainer when debugging, and when one of the 2nd 2 groupboxes are showing, the tab key moves the focus out of the app and into the test container. </p>\n\n<p>This does not happen when on the 1st groupbox (MainPanel). It works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Setting this stuff out took me about 3-4 hours to tedious work. Due to the number of controls, this application is hard to work with, as anytime a change is made to the form designer, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to process it.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a clue about what's going on here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net",".net","vb.net","events"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":13217704,"title":"What are scenarios that trigger Application_End event?","body":"<p>Asp.net has an <code>Application_End</code> event which occurs when the application comes to end, like this<br/></p>\n\n<pre><code>void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is the following: when does this event occurs in real, i.e. what kind of situations trigger it?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have a banking web application running <code>24x7x365</code>, which executes continuously &amp; accesses from thousands of places at a time, then when would this <code>Application_End</code> event occur?

I was hoping to get some insight here as none of the research I've done has helped me track down the problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am converting a number of applications from VB6 to .NET 4.0. At the request of the client, I am doing a straight conversion and only refactoring when necessary to avoid injecting other issues into the code as I convert. Most apps are being compiled in Any CPU mode, though a few have to be compiled as x86 because of reliance on 32-bit PLC software or older hardware drivers. My development machine is Windows 7 64-bit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After successfully converting two apps, the third application is crashing at \nrandom places in the code. The exception isn't caught and I have to look at the  Looking at the event log I am seeing Exception \ncode: 0xc0000005 on ntdll.dll, which I believe is a memory access exception. Since the application doesn't always crash in the same place, it is making it tough to track down. I have noticed that a lot of the errors occur during calls to ADODB (not always in the same place or on the same call), but it has also crashed on calls to form.ShowDialog(). </p>\n\n<p>The form where ShowDialog is being called writes some log information to the \nDB using ADODB. Though I haven't been able to confirm, I am guessing the exception within the form.ShowDialog() is happening during one of these ADODB calls. The crashing on the ADODB calls is happening in assemblies that are successfully being used in the other two apps that were converted and it doesn't consistently crash in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>In my research on this I have seen that bad interop can cause this issue.

Because the graphics engine is relatively simple, you get to spend your time building features into the game and it's possible for one person to quickly build something fun.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a typical screen might look something like this (the @ is the player, # is a wall, the other characters are things like monsters, stairs, and items):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thangorodrim.net/graphics/dumps/dump2.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm an experienced ASP.Net dev and I'm just getting started with Silverlight. Is there a particular approach I should take for this? </p>\n\n<p>To provide some background, in Winforms, most standard approaches are too slow  -- the text ends up updating with a visible, ugly blink. I'm thinking something to do with the Canvas might be appropriate, but even better would be to somehow draw a screen into a buffer and then instantly flip that onto the screen so that it becomes visible instantly. </p>\n\n<p>But I don't really want to mess around with DirectX right now - I'm hoping WPF can get me to where I need to be without a big learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n\n<p><b>Update:</b> So this turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried a lot of different approaches and I was finally able to get it to actually render fast enough, but I think that to make it blazing hot fast you should probably build a sprite map of the font you want to use and work from that instead of trying to use any of the built in font rendering stuff. I didn't do that.</p>\n\n<p>When I got the core rendering engine done, I ended up with some annoying artifacts related to quirks of font rendering (even fixed width fonts are sometimes a liiitle bit wide...), and when I finally worked that out I discovered <a href=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">libtcod</a>, which is a very impressive roguelike engine that has a C# wrapper. That's all console based. I played with it a little and I was blown away. </p>\n\n<p>As of 1.5.1, everything I've touched in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes (which I think they recently ditched), but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there, and that includes several line-of-sight, pathfinding, and even dungeon generation algorithms. It's pretty advanced visually. Have you ever seen an RL like this?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/files/screenshot0014.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, it's possible to build a roguelike with silverlight, but I wouldn't go in expecting it to be easy unless you've already got a strong silverlight or game dev background. You're going to be re-inventing some serious wheels, and even with a powerful toolkit that allows to focus on gameplay, there's no shortage of things to do.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","modem","gsm"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":4604,"score":1,"question_id":692592,"title":"Call Using GSM modem","body":"<p>I am developing Sms Project in vb.net.I can Send and receive Sms Easily.

What we haven't found as easy to standardize on is Option Compare Text/Binary as there seem to be advantages and disadvantages to both and different developers have differing opinions.  Some of the arguments for each side have been as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Some of the advantages/arguments for Option Compare Text:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It reduces verbosity in the code by removing the need for <code>StringComparer</code>s and <code>.ToLower()</code> calls and <code>StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase</code> all over the place</li>\n<li>Data needs are rarely concerned with casing, as evidenced by most databases being case-insensitive.  Rarely would you ever really want to distinguish between <code>THIS</code> and <code>This</code> and <code>this</code> when doing a data comparison.</li>\n<li>Certain specific use cases are simpler when you don't have to worry about casing.  For example, handling ASP.NET control events where commands are sent to the codebehind as strings and casing-issues are difficult to track down as the compiler cannot help you.  Think <code>Select Case</code> statements for <code>&lt;asp:repeater&gt;</code> events as an example.</li>\n<li>Many of the concerns raised about text comparison concern internationalization, which is often not that relevant to a lot of applications.</li>\n<li>VB specifically is case insensitive as a language, though Visual Studio helps you by at least enforcing consistency in your casing.  SQL is case insensitive as well.  Strings are the only place where you have to remember to worry about it, which highlights the awkwardness in ways you wouldn't normally notice it if you were worried about it everywhere.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some of the advantages/arguments for Option Compare Binary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>C# works this way, as do most other languages.  It's somewhat unexpected to have alternate behavior and the unexpected is not good in programming.</li>\n<li>There is a slight performance penalty with Option Compare Text as evidenced by the IL generated on compile.  Option Compare Binary doesn't have that penalty.</li>\n<li>Option Compare Text only makes certain parts of string handling case insensitive.  But, it doesn't make it so that things like dictionary indexing are case insensitive by default.  So, it's not like Option Compare Text actually makes it so that you don't have to worry about casing at all.  If it only works half way, why bother?</li>\n<li>Programming is hard.  It's best not to attempt to smooth over that fact.  Worrying about string casing is part of the deal.  Humans recognize <code>THIS</code> is different from <code>This</code> and <code>tHiS</code>.  Of course your code should too - after all, they aren't really the exact same string.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I'm really just wondering if there are any other considerations.</p>\n\n<p>-- EDIT 2 --</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it would help if I defined what I'd consider an answer to this.  If you can point to any authoritative external resource that talks through these issues more thoroughly, or point to a standards and best practices discussion or book that gives guidance on this topic, that would certainly count.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","vb6","barcode-scanner","scan"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":13097643,"title":"How get scanner list in vb?","body":"<p>I'm writing a piece of code in vb6  to scan documents.

Problem is, I barely know the methods and parameters of the RadioButtonList class at all. So perhaps I should be using some other method? If so, please tell me.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the situation: I have a stripped down default.aspx page. Aside from a  element, almost ALL the functionality has to be in the code-behind in aspx.vb.</p>\n\n<p>The program retreives information from a database, the number of which may vary, it compares this to another list of tables the number of which can also vary.</p>\n\n<p>So I need to \"bind\" a dynamic number of RadioButtonLists to the asp:table element controls, and I need to create a dynamic number of ListItems to each RadioButtonList created. Later, I need to be able to access the selected value of each in order to decide future functions in the database.</p>\n\n<p>An example of the code is like this:</p>\n\n<p>In .aspx:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:table ID=\"table1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><hr/>\nIn .aspx.vb (code-behind)</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sub createHtmlTables()\n\n    For i = 0 To productIndex.Count - 1\n\n        ''//create a RadioButtonList for each i\n        Dim row As New TableRow\n        Dim cell As New TableCell\n\n        For k = 0 To productTypeAmountIndex.Count - 1\n\n            ''//create a ListItem(radiobutton)\n            ''//for each k and include it in the RadioButtonList\n\n            ''//assign a value (for example name) of the product as\n            ''//the ListItems ID to retreive it later\n\n        Next\n\n        ''//add the RadioButtonList to cell.controls etc\n        Table1.Rows.Add(row)\n\n    Next\nEnd Sub\n\nSub addToDb()\n    For i = 0 To productIndex.Count - 1\n        ''//get the RadioButtonList for each i\n        ''//and return the value of the selected radiobutton\n        ''//within the list to a variable\n\n    Next\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sorry if this is long and confusing, but as I can't even form my questions right yet, I tried to include as much information as possible. Basically I just need an example of how and which methods to use to get all that working.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everyone keeps telling me that going for tables to begin with was a mistake, but some place I found claimed that you can't customize datagrid looks as easily as you can with tables. I guess I'll start the whole thing from scratch then.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is that the UI should be as graphically pleasing as possible, with the tables I can do all sorts of neat things such as colouring the cells according to the information inside etc.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thanks but not what I was looking for but I'll try to remake the thing with datagrid / gridview and see what happens.

In so doing, I've noticed a problem when querying with <em>LINQ</em> and <em>Lambda</em> expressions.  Specifically, calling a method within the lambda seems to always make the result set empty and never actually fires the method I'm attempting to filter with.  Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>' Query and filter container results \nPublic Function [Filter](pFilter As IFilter(Of T)) As System.Linq.IQueryable(Of T)\n    ' THIS YIELDS AN EMPTY SET EVEN WHEN pFilter.Test(o) ALWAYS RETURNS TRUE\n    Dim lResult As System.Linq.IQueryable(Of T) = mTable.Where(Function(o As T) pFilter.Test(o))\n\n    Return lResult\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>pFilter implements IFilter with this signature:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Interface IFilter(Of T)\n    Function Test(ByVal pObject As T) As Boolean\nEnd Interface\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've break pointed <code>pFilter.Test(o)</code> and found it is never actually called.

The true nature of this problem stems from my attempting to force a .NET function into something LINQ could turn into an SQL statement (which is impossible).  To solve this, I've changed my IFilter to return System.Linq.Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of T, Boolean)) for the Test method.  Now I can create strongly-typed filters which return predicates and pass them directly to Where() without the use of a lambda expression.  I'm also using <em>LinqKit</em> to make this work more easily for those who may be accomplishing similar tasks.

Something about having to create an instance of objects?  The issue is with the <code>Shared</code>.  Besides I’m not intending to get any output from the function, hence the use of Sub.</p>\n\n<p>Some have suggested that it must be <code>Public Shared Function</code>.  Please advise on why this is so or if there is another way of achieving the same.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","vb.net","wcf","httpcontext"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13071700,"title":"Cant get IP Address From Request WCF","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/391142/how-to-get-the-ip-address-of-a-wcf-remote-endpoint\">How to get the IP address of a WCF remote endpoint?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, we have broken out our API service layer, and have started adding more exposed WCF services. </p>\n\n<p>Our legacy code all used our \"in-house\" solution for emailing errors and exceptions, and we have to put that in the API layer that we are making.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, I just implemented a <strong>IErrorHandler</strong> as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public internal class ErrorHandler:IErrorHandler\n{\n    public void ProvideFault(Exception error, MessageVersion version, ref Message fault)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public bool HandleError(Exception error)\n    {\n        Path.To.Library.CustomError.Handle(error);\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add this error handler behavior, I made a custom service behavior as shown below</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CustomError: Attribute, IServiceBehavior\n{\n    public void Validate(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void AddBindingParameters(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase, Collection&lt;ServiceEndpoint&gt; endpoints, BindingParameterCollection bindingParameters)\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n        foreach (ChannelDispatcher c in serviceHostBase.ChannelDispatchers)\n        {\n            c.ErrorHandlers.Add(new ErrorHandler());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything up to this point works fine, and the call to the CustomError.Handle(...) is also being called.</p>\n\n<p>Once the following line is invoked in the <strong>ErrorHandler</strong>, it enters our legacy error handling which handles the error appropriately and emails which additionally is written in VB. (Please do not recommend another error/exception handling mechanism such as elmah because it is not my choice).</p>\n\n<p>Once this is invoked, we have the following lines that are executing pulling information off the HttpContext</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim CTX As System.Web.HttpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current\n\n//More Code...yada yada yada\n\nDim ip = CTX.Request.ServerVariables(\"REMOTE_ADDR\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem we are experiencing is SOMETIMES, we cannot get the IP address. We have tried multiple ways of getting it including REMOTE_HOST and Request.UserHostAddress, but sometimes they are not working when called from our WCF service layer. Anytime this code is called from anywhere else, it works fine and the ip shows up. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we have AspNetCompatibilityMode set to required because we need that in our WCF service.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what would be causing this, but we need to ensure that IP address is available when called from the WCF service. Is there something I have to set in the configuration for WCF to allow it to pass all the right Server Variables?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","application","loops","console","readline"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":1,"question_id":13071593,"title":"vb.net console application only works once","body":"<p>I'm just learning to code in vb.net and am currently messing around with VB.net console applications.

I built a regsitration page called register.aspx and created a wizard style form using ASP:Wizard with ASP:TextBox, ASP:DropdownList and ASP:CheckBoxList it's all laid out inside a HTML table and uses CSS for some of the formatting.

Where do I put the code?  How do I call the code? etc.</p>\n\n<p>I would ideally like to find a solution that meets the following requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn't get overwritten if I was to regenerate / update the Entity Model</li>\n<li>Doesn't need to be copy and pasted for every table in my model (most but not all have the audit columns in)</li>\n<li>Can be used for other columns, for example, if a user make a selection in a check list I may want to write some value into another (not exposed to the user) column.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Am I taking the right approach to displaying data in may webpages I certainly find the DataView and GridView limiting, I did think about creating a form like the registration form in table tags but have no Idea how to populate the textboxes etc with values from the database nor how to implement paging as many of the tables have one to many relationships, although saving changes would be easy if I did populate textboxes on a table.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all in advance to anyone who offers there support.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n\n<p>Ok so I have now got closer, but still not got it working correctly.

Most of our customers have a Dutch Windows installation and also most of them have their Regional Settings set to Dutch (nl-NL), implying the . (period) for grouping and the , (comma) as decimal separator.</p>\n\n<p>Out of our almost 10,000 customers, only ONE (1) had a problem, the cause of which we identified as originating in a call to SHGetFileInfo to get a (small) icon for a file. Relevant statements in the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We assessed that - at the particular PC of this customer - before the (first) call to SHGetFileInfo the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture was (nl-NL), as expected, but immediately after the call the CurrentCulture had switched to (en-US), which obviously caused problems elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Pausing the code at that point and inspecting the Configuration Panel, the Regional Settings THERE were still Dutch (nl-NL). Also, no SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged (or -Changing) events were caught in the code. After stopping and restarting the program, the CurrentCulture in the program was again Dutch (nl-NL) - until the first SHGetFileInfo call.</p>\n\n<p>In a practical sense we solved the issue by resetting the CurrentCulture if necessary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo0 Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n\n  Private Shared Function SHGetFileInfo(pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n    Dim ciBefore As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n\n    Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo0(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n\n    Dim ciAfter As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n    If (ciAfter.Name &lt;&gt; ciAfter.Name) OrElse (ciBefore IsNot ciAfter) Then\n      Application.CurrentCulture = ciBefore\n    End If\n\n    Return result\n  End Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the problem showed up only on that particular customer-PC, I had to analyze the issue on his PC , limiting my time to check things out. So, after solving the issue for him in the practical sense, I'm left with the unpleasant fact that I don't know how this could happen and my question, therefore, is: can anybody shed some light in this darkness?</p>\n\n<p>Additional information: the customer did not have this problem until a month ago. Recently he has started using (and presumably installed) DropBox and BoxSync. I have no knowledge of the internal workings of these, but as they also \"use files\" and their installations more or less coincide with the problem showing up, I do have suspicions that there may be a connection.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I've sufficiently stated the issue, but if more information is needed, I'll be glad to try and provide this.

As a result of the transformation, which was mostly automated, we still have quite a few places in the code where formatting of doubles (and dates/...) for textual presentation is processed as in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim sValue As String = Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6.Format(dblValue, \"0.00\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Conversely, when we need to extract a Double value from such a string, we use </p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim dblValue As Double = CDbl(sValue)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>CDbl \"listens to\" the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture of the applications Thread, and this does NOT change when - during the run of the code - you change the Regional Settings through the Control Panel.</p>\n\n<p>However, the VB6.Format as executed in the code starts out conforming to the currentCulture of the application (as you might expect), BUT apparently (I didn't know this, but accidentally found out) listens to CHANGES in the Regional Settings and responds immediately to any changes you make there during the program execution. This implies that the CDbl() and VB6.Format() become mutually inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, changing the Regional Settings during program execution is awkward, and moreover, if you wish to support it, you can manage it by catching the SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged (and -Changing) events and act upon their occurrences.</p>\n\n<p>However, the \"different behaviour\" of VB6.FORMAT versus \"normal\" casts as CDbl(someString) regarding changes in the Culture/Regional Settings, strikes me as undesirable. Preferably you would have VB6.Format to comply ALWAYS with the application/thread-CurrentCulture, and you may THEN choose how you want your code to respond to userpreference changes. Furthermore, I'd like to gain some more insight in the issue.</p>\n\n<p>My question, therefore, is:\nIs there a way to compile/arrange/... things such that the (Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.)VB6.Format listens to the application-CurrentCulture and NOT respond - without \"our consent\" - to changes in Regional Settings?</p>\n\n<p>Additional information:\nThe program is compiled with - for the visualbasic stuff - a reference in the project (VisualStudio2012) to:\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.Net\\Framework\\V2.0.50727\\Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.dll (and ...Data.dll).</p>\n\n<p>Any \"educational\" information or suggestion is welcome. The issue is not causing any real problems in our program, but I feel that we should/might have a better understanding and maybe even methods to make things more robust.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","datagridview","charts"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4901,"score":0,"question_id":3317718,"title":"VB.net Automatic chart update with new data entry","body":"<p>my chart loads data from a datagridview.</p>\n\n<p>Please how can i automatically update my chart with new data if new values are inserted into the datagridview.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>my chart is binded to table1 and table 2 in my datagridview. my datagrid gets values from a datatable. here is a sample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        Dim myData As New DataTable\n        wcAdapter.SelectCommand = wcCommand\n        wcAdapter.Fill(myData)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<pre><code>        Chart1.DataSource = myData\n\n        Chart1.Series(\"Series1\").ValueMemberX = \"table1\"\n        Chart1.Series(\"Series1\").ValueMembersY = \"table2\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>any suggestions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","winforms"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":12987173,"title":"How to close the child form","body":"<p>Using MDI and Child Forms</p>\n\n<p>Code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>childform_load\n\nMe.MdiParent = MDIMain\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>'</p>\n\n<pre><code> Private Sub form1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyDown\n     If e.KeyCode = Keys.Escape Then\n         Me.Close()\n     End If\n End Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above code is working for MDI Form (form name is mdiform1), but not working for child form1, when I press the escape key, it is closing the MDI Form instead of Child form.</p>\n\n<p>I check the Child Form Name also, name is form1 only.</p>\n\n<p>What was the problem, i need to change any property of child form.</p>\n\n<p>Need code help</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","generics","codedom"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":2,"question_id":12963383,"title":"Implement Generic Interface via CodeDom","body":"<p>The CodeDom is not generating legal VB for me when I try to implement a generic interface.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my VB code to generate the VB code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub RunTest()\n\n    Dim compileUnit = New CodeCompileUnit\n\n    Dim ns As New CodeNamespace()\n    compileUnit.Namespaces.Add(ns)\n    ns.Imports.Add(New CodeNamespaceImport(\"System\"))\n    ns.Imports.Add(New CodeNamespaceImport(\"System.Collections.Generic\"))\n\n    Dim fooCollection = New CodeTypeDeclaration(\"FooCollection\")\n    ns.Types.Add(fooCollection)\n    fooCollection.TypeAttributes = Reflection.TypeAttributes.Public\n    fooCollection.IsClass = True\n    fooCollection.BaseTypes.Add(New CodeTypeReference(GetType(System.Object)))\n    fooCollection.BaseTypes.Add(New CodeTypeReference( _\n        \"System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable\" _\n        , New CodeTypeReference() {New CodeTypeReference(\"Foo\")} _\n    ))\n\n    Dim method = New CodeMemberMethod\n    fooCollection.Members.Add(method)\n    method.Attributes = MemberAttributes.Private\n    method.Name = \"GetEnumerator\"\n    method.ReturnType = New CodeTypeReference( _\n        \"System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable\" _\n        , New CodeTypeReference() {New CodeTypeReference(\"Foo\")} _\n    )\n    method.PrivateImplementationType = New CodeTypeReference( _\n        \"System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable\" _\n        , New CodeTypeReference() {New CodeTypeReference(\"Foo\")} _\n    )\n\n    Dim provider = New Microsoft.VisualBasic.VBCodeProvider\n    Dim options = New Compiler.CodeGeneratorOptions\n    Dim writer = New IO.StringWriter\n    provider.GenerateCodeFromCompileUnit(compileUnit, writer, options)\n    Console.WriteLine(writer.ToString)\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that will generate:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Class FooCollection\n    Inherits Object\n    Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of Foo)\n\n    Function System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable`1_GetEnumerator() _\n    As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of Foo) _\n    Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of Foo).GetEnumerator\n\n    End Function\n\nEnd Class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is the name of the function.

(HOW TO CALL NVAPI FROM .NET)","body":"<p>I would normally post this on nvidia's developer forums but they are still offline from last months hacking. If anyone knows of another good community for these types of questions I would love to know about them.  </p>\n\n<p>I am developing some software designed to test human vision. Right now I have two tests written one that presents a stereoscopic image using nvidia's 3D vision v.2 glasses and another test that displays letters on the screen similar to the charts you see in an eye doctors exam room. My problem is the during the \"chart test\" the 3D vision is getting triggered and causing the screen to look dim. I can enable and disable the 3D vision through the nvidia control panel between running the different tests but that is a less then elegant solution. I am using DX9 and Visual Basic to develop my code. In order to trigger the 3D in the Stereoscopic test I am using the NV_STEREO_IMAGE_SIGNATURE Method that is described <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7377861/nv-stereo-image-signature-and-directx-10-11-nvidia-3d-vision\" title=\"NV_STEREO_IMAGE_SIGNATURE and DirectX 10/11 (nVidia 3D Vision)\">here</a>. Basically the method involves making a backbuffer that is twice the width of the screen plus an extra column of pixel data in the middle where you insert a special signature that tells the video card that it is a stereo image and the left half of the backbuffer should be displayed to the left eye and the right half to the right eye. I don't do any of that in my code for the \"Chart test\" but the 3d Vision is still getting triggered and I can't figure out why. Is there a way to tell the video card to temporally disable the 3d Vision functionality in the code?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","vb.net","session","persistence","viewstate"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":3,"question_id":12959617,"title":"How to persist temporary values between postbacks before inserting to the database?","body":"<h2>General Problem:</h2>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create something similar to this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6sg3W.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The user can select a product from the dropdown, click add, and the result is another product\nrow being added underneath in the \"Product Added\" section.

Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Class custom\n\nPublic Shared User_ID as integer\n\nPublic Shared sub GatherUserID()\n\n   User_ID = Session (\"user_ID\")\n\nend sub\n\nend class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Yes, it's a very simple example, but it gets my point across.

I see the advantage to sharing variables across classes (e.g. database connection strings), but I don't see how to set up a custom variable in a custom class that I can use just for that user without having to constantly call Sessions.</p>\n\n<p>I see that I can declare it as a Property as opposed to a shared variable, but I really don't know what exactly that is intended to accomplish, and no one seems to have a clear explanation.  Is a Property user/session-specific?  Will it solve my specific problem as a result?  This is what I don't get.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  just to clarify, the user_ID in this example is something I intend to use in several spots that get called during the creation of a page (e.g. the master file, the page itself, various classes.)

Here is the code i am using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim conInfo As New ConnectionInfo()\nconInfo.Type = CrystalDecisions.Shared.ConnectionInfoType.CRQE\nconInfo.Attributes.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"Database DLL\", \"crdb_adoplus.dll\"))\nconInfo.Attributes.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"QE_DatabaseName\", \"\"))\nDim dba As New DbConnectionAttributes\ndba.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"Class Name\", \"class name in that dll\"))\ndba.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"DataSet Names\", \"method in the class\"))\ndba.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"File Path\", \"path to dll.dll\"))\nconInfo.Attributes.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(\"QE_DatabaseType\", \"ADO.NET (XML)\"))\nconInfo.Attributes.Collection.Add(New NameValuePair2(DbConnectionAttributes.QE_LOGON_PROPERTIES, dba))\nCrystalReportViewer1.ParameterFieldInfo = paramFields\nCrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = ReportFileName\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Crystal report viewer shows up and asks for the login information which is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","winforms","itextsharp"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10886,"score":2,"question_id":1370394,"title":"itextsharp: how do i position a table?","body":"<p>I have created a simple table and i need to position. does anyone have experience with tables in itextsharp?</p>\n\n<p>here's my code</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Private Sub generate_PDF()\n    Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(\"C:\\Users\\alexluvsdanielle\\Desktop\\\")\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Chapter 6 example 1: Adding a Wmf, Gif, Jpeg and Png-file using urls\")\n    Dim document As Document = New Document\n    Try\n        Dim writer As PdfWriter = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, New FileStream(\"Chap1002.pdf\", FileMode.Create))\n\n\n        document.Open()\n        'Dim wmf As Image = Image.GetInstance(\"harbour.wmf\")\n        'Dim gif As Image = Image.GetInstance(\"vonnegut.gif\")\n        Dim jpeg As Image = Image.GetInstance(\"C:\\Users\\alexluvsdanielle\\Desktop\\test.jpg\")\n        'Dim png As Image = Image.GetInstance(\"hitchcock.png\")\n        'document.Add(wmf)\n        'document.Add(gif)\n        jpeg.ScalePercent(50)\n        'jpeg.Alignment = Image.TOP_BORDER\n        jpeg.SetAbsolutePosition(0, 562)\n        document.Add(jpeg)\n        'document.Add(png)\n        Dim cb As PdfContentByte = writer.DirectContent\n\n        cb.BeginText()\n        Dim bf As BaseFont = BaseFont.CreateFont(BaseFont.HELVETICA, BaseFont.CP1252, BaseFont.NOT_EMBEDDED)\n        cb.SetFontAndSize(bf, 12)\n        'Dim text As String = \"Sample text for alignment\"\n        'cb.ShowTextAligned(PdfContentByte.ALIGN_CENTER, text + \" Center\", 250, 700, 0)\n        'cb.ShowTextAligned(PdfContentByte.ALIGN_RIGHT, text + \" Right\", 250, 650, 0)\n        'cb.ShowTextAligned(PdfContentByte.ALIGN_LEFT, text + \" Left\", 250, 600, 0)\n        cb.SetTextMatrix(150, 652)\n        cb.ShowText(patient_name)\n\n        cb.SetTextMatrix(150, 637)\n        cb.ShowText(doc_name)\n\n        cb.SetFontAndSize(bf, 8)\n\n        cb.SetTextMatrix(150, 620)\n        cb.ShowText(lot__no)\n\n        cb.SetTextMatrix(150, 611)\n        cb.ShowText(patient_id)\n\n\n        Dim i As Integer\n        For i = 1 To 10\n            cb.SetTextMatrix(150, 600 - (i * 10))\n            cb.ShowText(DataGridView1.Item(3, i).Value)\n        Next\n        cb.EndText()\n\n\n        Dim aTable As Table = New Table(2, 2)\n\n        aTable.Offset = 10\n\n        aTable.Width = 100\n\n\n\n\n        aTable.AddCell(\"0.0\")\n        aTable.AddCell(\"0.1\")\n        aTable.AddCell(\"1.0\")\n        aTable.AddCell(\"1.1\")\n        document.Add(aTable)\n\n        Dim datatable As PdfPTable = New PdfPTable(12)\n        Dim page As Rectangle = document.PageSize\n        datatable.TotalWidth = 100\n\n\n        datatable.AddCell(\"hello\")\n\n\n        datatable.WriteSelectedRows(0, -1, document.LeftMargin, document.BottomMargin, writer.DirectContent)\n        document.Add(datatable)\n\n    Catch de As DocumentException\n        Console.Error.WriteLine(de.Message)\n        MessageBox.Show(de.Message)\n    Catch ioe As IOException\n        Console.Error.WriteLine(ioe.Message)\n        MessageBox.Show(ioe.Message)\n    Catch e As Exception\n        Console.Error.WriteLine(e.Message)\n        MessageBox.Show(e.Message)\n\n    End Try\n    document.Close()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the first table works but the second does not</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","vb.net","database-design","currency","accounting"],"answer_count":24,"favorite_count":21,"up_vote_count":40,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15830,"score":40,"question_id":61872,"title":"Use Float or Decimal for Accounting Application Dollar Amount?","body":"<p>We are rewriting our legacy Accounting System in VB.NET and SQL Server.

Neither WCF nor Named Pipes is a good fit for this, due to the reasons discussed <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/b83c8f10-fbe4-47bc-9652-7f4a0715c39a/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For my prototype I've created two simple applications--a console app represents the WinForms 'client' and a WinForms app represents the WinService 'server.'</p>\n\n<p>I've had to overcome two main problems: 1) The server's timer fires only once every three seconds, and 2) The OS seems to require at least a full second to acquire and then release a mutex. This second point has got me curious. I'd have thought the process was instant, but apparently I'm mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>To accomodate these two issues I've used Thread.Sleep--two seconds to wait for the server's timer and one second to wait for the mutex handling. Intervals of any less than these cause intermittent read/write synchronization failures. Of course feel free to tweak the code to get your own results.</p>\n\n<p>My test is comprised of a 30,000-iteration loop in the client that 'calls' the 'method' in the server and writes the response to a log file.

So, on form \"B\", I have the contents of form \"A\" and the blank part of \"B\" to filled out...So two seperate fromviews on the page..\"A\" and \"B\"</p>\n\n<p>That works fine, the issue is when I change the mode to edit previous entry. So if I have a button or the default linkbutton to change from ReadOnly to Edit I not only lose bindings but any efforts to counteract that have left me with issues when I postback. </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>DUE TO LENGTH I'M LEAVING SOME CODE OUT</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>On my button I'm using FormView2.ChangeMode(FormViewMode.Edit) to change view, the default link button I've not changed</p>\n\n<p>Bindings on my listboxes are setup like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>If Not Page.IsPostBack Then\n    'pulling bindings from table\n    cmd = New OleDbCommand(\"SELECT * FROM mslToi\", objCon)\n    objReader = cmd.ExecuteReader\n    lst1.DataValueField = \"listing\"\n    lst1.DataTextField = \"listing\"\n    lst1.DataSource = objReader\n    lst1.DataBind()\n\n    'pre-selecting input data from form \"A\"\n    cmd = New OleDbCommand(\"SELECT [type_of_injury] FROM S2childToi WHERE ID = \" &amp; qs &amp; \"\", objCon)\n    objReader = cmd.ExecuteReader\n        Do While objReader.Read\n\n            For Each y As ListItem In lst1.Items\n                If y.Text = objReader.Item(0) Then\n                    y.Selected = True\n                End If\n            Next\n        Loop\n\nend if\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the page load event.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>MARKUP FOR THE FORMVIEW AS ASKED</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:FormView ID=\"FormView2\" runat=\"server\" \n    Width=\"100%\" DataSourceID=\"AccessDataSource4\"&gt;\n\n&lt;ItemTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;\n\n&lt;EditItemTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/EditItemTemplate&gt;\n\n&lt;/asp:FormView&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>'''that is the short and sweet of the formview markup as requested. It may also be worth noting that it doesn't matter what mode I start in, if I change modes it equals same result'''</p>\n\n<p>That works fine so far...it's when I change view to Edit that my listbox appears to no longer be bound (controls appear but have no content). My thought is that obviously I'm blocking out my code from postback events (I have a reason for this). I can use this code (without the If Not Page.IsPostBack) to force the selections and bindings but whenever I postback they will defualt to the table data, which can't happen, each listbox needs to postback so I can check for a certain selection. So what happens is the user input is trumped. Short and sweet. </p>\n\n<p>I'm sorry that I can't explain better, any advice is much appreciated.
