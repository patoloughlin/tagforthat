I have tried several things, but haven't been able to improve this.</p>\n\n<p>The CLOBs are used for gathering report data.  This can be quite large on a record by record basis.  I am calling a procedure on the remote databases (across a WAN) to build the data, then copying the results back to the database at the corporate headquarters for comparison.  The general format is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE my_report(the_db VARCHAR2(30), object_id VARCHAR2(30), \nfinal_value CLOB, CONSTRAINT my_report_pk PRIMARY KEY (the_db, object_id));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To gain performance, I accumulate the results for remote sites into remote copies of the table.  At the end of the procedure run, I try to copy the data back.  This query is very simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO my_report SELECT * FROM my_report@europe;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The performance that I am seeing is around 9 rows per second, with an average CLOB size of 3500 bytes.  (I am using CLOBs as this size often goes above 4k, the VARCHAR2 limit.)  For 70,000 records (not uncommon) this takes around 2 hours to transfer.  I have tried using the <code>create table as select</code> method, but this gets the same performance.  I also spent more than a few hours tuning SQL*NET, but see no improvement from this.  Changing the Arraysize does not improve the performance (though it can reduce it if the value is reduced.</p>\n\n<p>I am able to get a copy over using the old exp/imp methods (export the table from remote, import it back in), which runs much faster, but this is fairly manual for my automated report.  I have considered trying to write a pipelined function to select this data from, using it to split the CLOBS into BYTE/VARCHAR2 chunks (with an additional chunk number column), but didn't want to do this if someone had tried it and found a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","oracle","parameterized"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":723,"score":6,"question_id":7383121,"title":"Embedded SQL vs Dynamic SQL","body":"<p>I am currently doing a *cough*Oracle*cough* database subject.

Actually, I've just started learning about XML schemas (I'm totally a beginner). I've purchased the book \"Definitive XML Schema\" written by Priscilla Walmsley (2nd Edition) which presents XML Schema 1.1 (which I believe is the most recent version).</p>\n\n<p>Now the problem is that in all examples and exercices of the book, the namespaces and location of the schema files are given using a web URL.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of the book:</p>\n\n<p>This is the schema</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;xs:schema  xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n            targetNamespace=\"http://datypic.com/prod\"\n            xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;xs:element name=\"product\" type=\"prod:ProductType\"/&gt;\n    &lt;xs:complexType name=\"ProductType\"&gt;\n        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n            &lt;xs:element name=\"number\" type=\"xs:integer\"/&gt;\n            &lt;xs:element name=\"size\" type=\"prod:SizeType\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n        &lt;xs:attribute name=\"effDate\" type=\"xs:date\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n    &lt;xs:simpleType name=\"SizeType\"&gt;\n        &lt;xs:restriction base=\"xs:integer\"&gt;\n            &lt;xs:minInclusive value=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;xs:maxInclusive value=\"18\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the XML content to be validated against the above mentioned is this</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;prod:product xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\" \n          xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/XMLSchema-instance\"\n          xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://datypic.com/prod prod.xsd\"\n          effDate=\"2011-04-12\"&gt;\n    &lt;number&gt;557&lt;/number&gt;\n    &lt;size&gt;10&lt;/size&gt;\n&lt;/prod:product&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously, [http://datypic.com/prod] is a site maintained by the author, so I cannot add or DELETE any file on this site for my exercices while I'm reading this book. As a result I need to put both XML and XSD documents on my local hard drive (I'm using Linux Fedora Core 17 X86_64). So what I did, was to put the content of the schema in a file named for example '<strong>Example-01.xsd</strong>' and the XML content in a file named '<strong>Example-01.xml</strong>'. </p>\n\n<p>I use oracle PL/SQL package DBMS_XMLSCHEMA (Enterprise Edition 11.2.0.1.0) in order to first register the schema and then call the validate method of XMLType object in order to validate my XML document against the schema, similar to the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=2462207\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=2462207</a></p>\n\n<p>I have created a directory (by CREATE DIRECTORY) statement in oracle : </p>\n\n<p>/home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/</p>\n\n<p>Where I put both my XML &amp; XSD documents. Here is precisely how I changed the above mentioned XML content in order to refer to XSD locally</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;prod:product xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\" \n              xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/XMLSchema-instance\"\n              xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://datypic.com/prod file:///home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/Example-01.xsd\"\n               effDate=\"2011-04-12\"&gt;\n    &lt;number&gt;557&lt;/number&gt;\n    &lt;size&gt;10&lt;/size&gt;\n&lt;/prod:product&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if you compare the new XML content with the above mentioned example, the only thing that I added was <strong>file:///home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/Example-01.xsd</strong> at the end of the value of <strong>xsi:schemaLocation</strong> in order to refer to the local hard drive. I found this method, here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Dec/0161.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Dec/0161.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is that it doesn't work. When I run my script in order to validate the document by calling the schemaValidate() method of the XMLType object, here is oracle error message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n*\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-19030: Method invalid for non-schema based XML Documents.\nORA-06512: at \"SYS.XMLTYPE\", line 354\nORA-06512: at \"TRAIN2012.ZXML_PKG\", line 176\nORA-06512: at line 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I understand from the error message '<strong>Method invalid for non-schema based XML Documents'</strong> is that oracle has simply ignored the filepath that I defined for schema file and it considers that there has not been any schema declared for this XML document.</p>\n\n<p>Any idea?

Below is a sample resulting set of my query:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>Shift        StartDateTime        EndDateTime            DifferenceInMinutes\nB            09/25/2012 17:38:40  09/25/2012 19:12:26    93.7667\nB            09/25/2012 19:12:26  09/25/2012 19:25:03    12.6167\nB            09/25/2012 19:25:03  09/26/2012 05:55:08    630.0833\nA            09/26/2012 05:55:08  09/26/2012 09:19:55    24.8\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The total in DifferenceInMinutes should always be 720 per shift. What I did is that on each start of a shift, it'll be 6:00 AM for Shift A and 18:00 on Shift B. I used Case When to be able to do this. Below will be another example of the resulting set:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>Shift        StartDateTime        EndDateTime            DifferenceInMinutes\nB            09/25/2012 18:00:00  09/25/2012 19:12:26    72.43333\nB            09/25/2012 19:12:26  09/25/2012 19:25:03    12.6167\nB            09/25/2012 19:25:03  09/26/2012 05:55:08    630.0833\nA            09/26/2012 06:00:00  09/26/2012 09:19:55    199.9167\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now my only problem is the EndDateTime, the last item on a shift should always end at 18:00 for Shift A and 6:00 for Shift B. I want to achieve something like below:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>Shift        StartDateTime        EndDateTime            DifferenceInMinutes\nB            09/25/2012 18:00:00  09/25/2012 19:12:26    72.43333\nB            09/25/2012 19:12:26  09/25/2012 19:25:03    12.6167\nB            09/25/2012 19:25:03  09/26/2012 06:00:00    634.95\nA            09/26/2012 06:00:00  09/26/2012 09:19:55    199.9167\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I must admit that I do not know how to use Case When like what I have done on StartDateTime so I'm really hoping that there is a way for this.

I want to query/display it with <strong>php</strong> using <strong>oci8</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the database is in ISO8859P9, i.e. the query</p>\n\n<pre><code>select parameter, value from v$nls_parameters where parameter in ('NLS_CHARACTERSET', 'NLS_LANGUAGE', 'NLS_TERRITORY')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns</p>\n\n<pre><code>NLS_LANGUAGE        AMERICAN\nNLS_TERRITORY       AMERICA\nNLS_CHARACTERSER    WE8ISO8859P9\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I have set up NLS_LANG variable accordingly, i.e. getenv(\"NLS_LANG\") returns \"AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P9\".</p>\n\n<p>I inserted <code>AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-9</code> to /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset file, and I always included <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-9\"&gt;</code> in head section of html content of php files. So when I check via firebug, I see that the \"Content-Type\" header for a response is \"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-9\".</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I have a line as <code>default_charset = \"ISO-8859-9\"</code> in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file, and in the core section of the output phpinfo(), I see that default_charset is ISO-8859-9.</p>\n\n<p>After all these stuff, when I retrieve a string with a character <code>İ</code> in it and echo it, it is shown as '?'. That is the problem!!! When I query <code>select dump(nameofthatstring, 16)...</code>, I see that its byte value is DD, i.e. correct according to 8859-9.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure whether it is relevant but, I will give a final detail: When I enter a character <code>ı</code> in a form and submit it via ajax in GET, it is converted to %FD, i.e. the 8859-9 corresponding value, no problem. </p>\n\n<p>When I urldecode it and echo it, it is again ok, I see <code>ı</code>. But when I have a query with a string containing <code>ı</code> in its where clause (after receiving the ajax request), it returns empty set. </p>\n\n<p>However, if I select the rows using CHR(253), the rows are selected correctly, but printing these rows again results in '?' characters.</p>\n\n<p>I am really stuck.

My database (which I inherited) is poorly designed and the logic needed to decide upon a rows inclusion is complex.  Unfortunately, redesigning the database is not an option.  I'm vastly simplifying the logic here, so it's not a case where a simple join or where clause can be used.  There's a complex hierarchy to the data, and the data format definition.</p>\n\n<p>In psuedo code, the way-oversimplified decision would look something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n   --select our basic attributes\n\n     select XMLEMENT(\"product\",XMLELEMENT(\"productName\",name),XMLELEMENT(\"productNumber\",product_number))\ninto xml_output from products where product_number = 100;\n\n   --now process our obsolete rows\n   select XMLELEMENT(\"productObsoletes\") into xml_output from dual;\n   FOR c_row in (select * from product_obsoletes where id=100)\n   LOOP\n       IF c_row.display = 'YES' THEN\n        select XMLELEMENT(\"obsoletedProduct\", XMLATTRIBUTES(c_row.label as \"label\"), c_row.obsoleted_product_id) into xml_output from dual;\n       ELSE\n          CONTINUE;\n       END IF;\n   END LOOP;\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously though, this doesn't work.  First, XMLElement always puts a closing tag on, so unless you can formulate a single select statement containing all of your elements, it's not going to work. Second, in this example, I'd be overwriting the previous XMLELEMENT output.  I can't concatenate, because XMLELEMENT has already closed the tag.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I can think of at this point is to select the various XMLElement pieces I need into different VARCHARS and then use string manipulation functions to find the right spot to insert the various pieces.  Ugly with a capital-U.</p>\n\n<p>Is there another solution?  Is there perhaps a way to prevent XMELEMENT from closing the tag so that you can you use complex looping logic?  Or another Oracle construct which would allow me to achieve my goal of building up this XML without having to use a single select statement?</p>\n\n<p>My path of last resort would be to do the XML generation from another language such as Java or Perl where I could simply fetch the data and then do my complex processing and XML generation there.  However, I'd much prefer just to have a SQL function which would return the correct XML as a string, so if it's possible to do it in PL/SQL, that'd be my preferred route.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","perl","oracle","parsing","lexical-analysis"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":13132696,"title":"Parse Oracle Query using perl","body":"<p>I have to perform lexical analysis on the oracle query and separate the query to various parts (based on the clauses)in perl.

I.E., if Bob Smith has had four accounts during his career here (people come and go frequently, as employees and/or contractors), I want to work with a set of accounts that all belong(ed) to Bob Smith.</p>\n\n<p>If Bob came here as an contractor, converted to an employee, left, came back as a contractor in another country, and left/returned to a legal org that is now in our SAP system, his account rename/chain might look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Bob Smith  CONTRACTOR   ----    US0T0001  -&gt;  US001101  (given a new ID as an employee)\nBob Smith  EMPLOYEE     ----    US001101  -&gt;  EB0T0001  (contractor ID for  the UK)\nBob Smith  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T000T                (no rename performed)\nBob Smith  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                (currently-active ID)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example, the four accounts are linked by either a <code>new_user_id</code> field that was set when the user was renamed or through having the same SAP ID.</p>\n\n<p>Because HR frequently fails to follow the business process, returning users may end up with any of those four ID being restored to them.  I have to analyze all the IDs for Bob Smith and say \"Bob Smith can only have TE110001 restored\", and kick back an error if they try to restore something else.  I have to do it for 90,000+ records.</p>\n\n<p>The first column, \"Bob Smith\", is just an identifier to the group of associated accounts.  In my original example, I'm using the root User ID as the identifier (e.g. US0T0001).  If I use first/last names to identify users, I end up with collisions.</p>\n\n<p>So Bob Smith would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>US0T0001  1  CONTRACTOR   ----    US0T0001  -&gt;  US001101  (given a new ID as an employee)\nUS0T0001  2  EMPLOYEE     ----    US001101  -&gt;  EB0T0001  (contractor ID for  the UK)\nUS0T0001  3  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001                (no rename performed)\nUS0T0001  4  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                (currently-active ID)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where 1, 2, 3, 4 are the levels in the heirarchy.  </p>\n\n<p>Since US0T0001, US001101, EB0T0001, and TE110001 are all accounted for, I don't want another group for them.  But the results I have now have those accounts listed in multiple groups:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>US001101  1  EMPLOYEE     ----    US001101  -&gt;  EB0T0001  (\nUS001101  2  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001                \nUS001101  3  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001               \n\nEB0T0001  1  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001               \nEB0T0001  2  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                \n\nUS001101  1  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This causes two problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When I query the results for a User ID, I get hits from multiple groups</li>\n<li>Each group will report a different expected user ID for Bob Smith.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><br />\nYou asked for an expanded set of records... here are some actual data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- NumRootUsers tells me how many accounts are associated with a user.\n-- The new user ID field is explicitly set in the database, but may be null.\n-- The calculated new user ID analyzes records to determine what the next related record is\n\n          NumRoot                   New User    Calculated\nRootUser  Users    Level  UserId    ID Field    New User ID   SapId       LastName        FirstName\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBG100502  3        1      BG100502  BG1T0873    BG1T0873                  GRIENS VAN      KION\nBG100502  3        2      BG1T0873  BG103443    BG103443                  GRIENS VAN      KION\nBG100502  3        3      BG103443                            41008318    VAN GRIENS      KION\n\n-- This group causes bad matches for Kion van Griens... the IDs are already accounted for,\n-- and this group doesn't even grab all of the accounts for Kion.

This addition was done in one of our scripts, with the purpose being to allow us to track what release of our product the database was last updated to.</p>\n\n<p>When each script completes execution and is committed (using IDbContext and IDbTransaction), the application updates the DB_VERSION table with the major/minor version of the application along with the number of the script.  Prior to adding the Major/Minor columns, the application just updated the script number.</p>\n\n<p>In SQLServer, there are no issues at all - when the application completes, the DB_VERSION table properly indicates the version of the app.  However, in Oracle, the APP_MAJOR and APP_MINOR columns are never updated.</p>\n\n<p>I have tracked this to the query we use that verifies whether or not the table as the new columns - and even after script execution is complete, the new columns are not showing up.  It appears that Oracle is caching the previous query so never makes the new columns available for update (though the Version column that was always updated continues to be updated properly).</p>\n\n<p>We have tried manually closing the connection, completely terminating the context and putting in a 5 second wait period to allow the pools to expire (I know, I know), changing the structure of the script itself to use straight DDL - all to no avail.

Again, being fairly new to this, I'm not sure what the best way to go about doing this would be?

Unfortunately we don't have any in house Oracle development experience to speak of but as a senior dev it has fallen to me to lead the project. So far I have managed to make our app connect to an Oracle database (I'm using Oracle XE 11.2) by using the following connection string:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Data Source=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=VS010-ORA11GR1)(PORT=1523))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=DEVORA)));User Id=dbo;Password=dbo;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason we decided to use this type of connection string is because we do not want to rely on changing tnsnames.ora on every client machine. However, as you can see this specifies an Oracle user and associated password. We also need to provide the ability to use the equivalent of SQL Server integrated security.</p>\n\n<p>According to the literature I have read, to do this I simply need to specify <code>/</code> as the user id and then omit the password portion (as this is ignored anyway for Windows authentication). I also created the user in Oracle, making sure it matched the Windows user, with the following snippets:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE USER \"OPS$&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\\&lt;user&gt;\" IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;\n\nGRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE TO \"OPS$&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\\&lt;user&gt;\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also checked that the sqlnet.ora file on my local machine which hosts the XE instance and my dev environment contained the line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES= (NTS)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I understood that this would enable my app to connect to the Oracle database uing Windows Authentication. However what actually happens is that I get the following Oracle error message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ORA-01005: null password given; logon denied</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this doesn't make much sense because of course its null - it's supposed to be, according to the tutorials I've read. </p>\n\n<p>The app targets .Net Framework 3.5, we are using the System.Data.OracleProvider  and the actual connecting and so on is handled by Enterprise Library 5. Incidentally, I am aware of the deprecation of the OracleClient component but I just want this to work before I go into the extra complexities of changing providers.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm missing? Have I chosen the wrong type of connection string?

We are using Rational Software Development Platform V6 with WebSphere V5.1 to run our application. We work with a CVS to share the sources. The application generates a PDF report and ZIPs it, then it puts it in the data base (Oracle 9i) in a BLOB field. Up until now, everything works fine. With RAD, we use the ojdbc14.jar to connect the data base (we've been using it since forever...). So, that being said, when we run the application locally, the following line raises an exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tempBlob = BLOB.createTemporary(cnn, true, BLOB.DURATION_SESSION);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The exception is an SQLException saying invalid argument(s) in call. Looking at this, I don't see which argument might be wrong, since the data base access is centralized and the object cnn is OracleConnection type, that is retreive with the same function we use all over the application. SO, I tryied using ByteInputStream to set the parameter of the prepared statement using setByteStream. The value of my byte array is ok, it contains something like 2 MO. When I execute the query, it says 1 row update. There is a field in the data base call finished_time that is successfully updated and the other field, the report field, is null....</p>\n\n<p>If I go back to the createTemportary function, we worked 3 developers for a day to trouble shoot the problem, an we found nothing wrong... So, I decided to migrate the code on the DEV server. I commit the changes, create a totally new workspace, checked out and run an Ant build, that builds, sent through FTP the WAR and deploys it on the WebSphere server. Then I try the report generation and the DB is successfully update. The function createTemporary doen't raise any exception, but locally. The problem is, no one of us can do that locally!?!

It opens database connections, runs a stored procedure or packaged method, then disconnects. Connection pooling is turned on, and we are currently under version 11g in both our development and test environments, but under 10gR2 in our production environment. This happens on Production.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, a process began firing off a ORA-2020 error. The process is called from a webpage on our internal website. The user simply sets a date, hits a button, and a job is started on another system that is separate from the website. The call itself, however, uses a database link to run a function.</p>\n\n<p>We've scoured the SQL to find that it only uses that one database link.

The only way I can bring up this error is if I run a query with 4 DB links, then a function or piece of dynamic SQL with a database link within it.

What are the disadvantages of increasing the number?</li>\n<li>Do I need to explicitly close open database links before disconnecting from the database?

For example say I want to find overlaps with the 10:58A-11:25A time. This needs to find potential time concurrencies.  I am looking for a count of the maximum number of concurrent overlaps. In my example for 10:58A-11:25A, I would want to see the following (count would be 5):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Patient          Start Time        End Time\nAlice            10:18A            12:29P\nJane             10:52A            11:29A\nJules            10:54A            11:40A\nAdam             10:58A            11:25A\nBen              11:00A            11:20A\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my second example some of the concurrent times overlap with the time I am looking for, but they are over before another range start.  So, say I am looking for 10:46A-10:55A.  I would expect a count of 4. In this example 08:31A-10:49A is dropped because it is over before 10:52A-11:29A starts. Same with 10:32A-10:49A, it was over before 10:52A-11:29A started. So, the most concurrent with the 10:46A-10:55A range would be 4, even though overall there is 6 (2 dropped).</p>\n\n<pre><code>Patient          Start Time        End Time\nAlice            10:18A            12:29P\nSally            10:46A            10:55A\nJane             10:52A            11:29A\nJules            10:54A            11:40A\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can this be done with a sql statement?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["oracle","constraints","drop"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8776,"score":6,"question_id":1690404,"title":"How to drop all user tables?","body":"<p>How can I drop all user tables in oracle?</p>\n\n<p>I have problem with constraints.

I recently stumbled upon this gem, which takes about 6-7 <em>hours</em> to run and returns ~1400 rows. The table/view in question contains ~200'000 rows. I thought this felt like it was taking maybe a little longer than seemed reasonable, so I started having a closer look at it. Now I can't, for security/proprietary reasons, share the exact query, but this should show what the query does in more general terms:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\n    some_field,\n    some_other_field\nFROM (\n    SELECT\n        *\n    FROM\n        some_view a\n    WHERE\n        some_criteria AND\n        a.client_no || ':' || a.engagement_no || ':' || a.registered_date = (\n            SELECT\n                b.client_no || ':' || b.engagement_no || ':' || MAX(b.registered_date)\n            FROM\n                some_view b\n                JOIN some_engagement_view e\n                    ON e.client_no = b.client_no AND e.engagement_no = b.engagement_no\n                JOIN some_client_view c\n                    ON c.client_no = b.client_no\n            WHERE\n                some_other_criteria AND\n                b.client_no = a.client_no AND\n                b.engagement_no = a.engagement_no\n            GROUP BY\n                b.client_no,\n                b.engagement_no\n        )\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically what it is supposed to do, as far as I've managed to figure out, is to from some_view (which contains evaluations of customers/engagements) fetch the latest evaluation for every unique client/engagement.</p>\n\n<p>The two joins are there to ensure that the client and engagement exists in another system, where they are primarily handled after you have done the evaluation in this system.</p>\n\n<p>Notice how it concatenates two numbers and a date, and then compares that to a sub-query? \"Interesting\" design-choice. So I thought that if you replace the concatenation with a proper comparison you might get some kind of performance gain at least. Please notice that I primarily develop .NET and for the web, and am far from an expert when it comes to databases, but I rewrote it as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\n    some_field,\n    some_other_filed\nFROM\n    some_view a\nWHERE\n    some_criteria AND\n    (a.client_no, a.engagement_no, a.registered_date) = (\n        SELECT\n            b.client_no,\n            b.engagement_no,\n            MAX(b.registered_date)\n        FROM\n            some_view b\n            JOIN some_engagement_view e\n                ON e.client_no = b.client_no AND e.engagement_no = b.engagement_no\n            JOIN some_client_view c\n                ON c.client_no = b.client_no\n        WHERE\n            some_other_criteria AND\n            b.client_no = a.client_no AND\n            b.engagement_no = a.engagement_no\n        GROUP BY\n            b.client_no,\n            b.engagement_no\n    )\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if I replace the fields in the very first select with a <code>COUNT(1)</code>, I get exactly the same number of rows with both queries, so a good start. The new query fetches data just as fast as it counts, &lt; 10 seconds. The old query gets the count in ~20 seconds, and as I mentioned before, the data takes close to 6-7 hours.

Picks, putaways, and relocates look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>| USER_ID | PICKS | PICK_VOLUME |\n+---------+-------+-------------+\n\n| SMITH12 | 234   | 2431.12     |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The putaways and relocates tables look identical except 'PICKS' and 'PICK_VOLUME' are replaced with putaways and relocates, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The table that I would like to do a left join on is the users table since it will contain all of the user_ids, regardless if they only picked inventory and didn't relocate, or put any of it away. In other words, I would like to see all the records even if some users only have relocates, instead of having picks, putaways, and relocates, or any combination thereof.</p>\n\n<p>The user table looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>| USER_ID | SHIFT | GROUP_ID   |\n+---------+-------+------------+\n\n| SMITH12 | NIGHT | STOCK_KEEP |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So ideally, I would like to have those three columns at the left of my result set, with the picks, putaways, and relocates table joined to the right. The final select results should look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>| USER_ID | SHIFT | GROUP_ID   | PICKS | PICK_VOL | RELOCATES | RELOCATE_VOL | PUTAWAYS | PUTAWAY_VOL |\n+---------+-------+------------+-------+----------+-----------+--------------+----------+-------------+\n\n| SMITH12 | NIGHT | STOCK_KEEP | 234   | 2431.12  | NULL      |  NULL        |  4       |   76.52     |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried this SQL query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select users.user_id, users.group_id, users.shift, pi.\"Picks\", pi.\"Pick Volume\", pu.\"Putaways\", pu.\"Putaway Volume\", re.\"Relocates\", re.\"Relocate Volume\"\nfrom users, pi, pu, re\nwhere users.user_id = pi.user_id\nand users.user_id = pu.user_id\nand users.user_id = re.user_id;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it only returns rows where a user has at least one transaction in the picks, relocates, and putaways tables. This is expected since I'm doing a vanilla join. I'm asssuming I need some kind of left join, but I'm not sure how to write it in Oracle 8i. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","oracle","sql-injection"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12938703,"title":"SQL Injection and multiline comments","body":"<p>I was testing a clients' queries and came across an interesting question.

The web service connects to the database using the .NET framework's data provider for Oracle (not to be confused with ODP). Our testers have experienced sporadic Oracle account locking which seems to happen shortly after changing the user's Oracle password. The dba_audit_trail logs have revealed what seem to be automated connection attempts at very regular intervals (i.e. every two minutes on the dot) without any user or client activity. Numerous logs (IIS, WCF tracing, message logging, etc.) have confirmed these connection attempts are not initiated directly by the client application; they must be coming independently from the web service or from inside the System.Data.OracleClient library. The automatic attempts continue forever until the web service's worker process (single worker) dies from inactivity.</p>\n\n<p>In some instances, these automatic attempts get started before the password change, and they connect successfully to the database, but as soon as the password changes, the next attempt fails for invalid username/password. After three attempts, the account gets locked. We are trying to find the source of these periodic connection attempts.</p>\n\n<p>I found a very similar, but unanswered, problem on Oracle's forum <a href=\"https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1114009\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our latest investigations have led us to believe it is an unexpected behavior from connection pooling. If the user connected to the web service before the password change, a connection pool would be created for the original connection string. After changing the password and logging back into the web service, the data provider would create a new connection pool based on the new connection string.</p>\n\n<p>Could something inside the data provider be trying to keep the old connection alive from the first connection pool? Perhaps the first connection pool is discarding the old connection and attempting to replenish it with a new one (with the now invalid connection string). What could cause this?

Requests come to the load balancer which redirects the incoming requests to one of the 6 local servers. In certain time intervals data is gathered in the main server and redistributed to the 6 local servers to be able to make decisions with the complete data. </p>\n\n<p>Each local server has a cache component that caches the incoming requests based on different parameters (Location, incoming parameters, etc). With each request a local server decides whether to go to the database (ORACLE) or get the response from the cache. However in both cases the local server has to goto the database to do 1 insert and 1 update per request. </p>\n\n<h2>PROBLEM:</h2>\n\n<p>On a peak day each local server receives 2000 requests per second and system starts slowing down (CPU: 90% ). I am trying to increase the capacity before adding another local server to the mix. After running some benchmarks the bottleneck as it always is, seems to be the inevitable 1 insert and 1 update per request to database. </p>\n\n<h2>TRIED METHODS</h2>\n\n<p>To be able decrease the frequency I have created a Windows service that sits between the DB and .NET application. It contains a pipe server and receives each insert and update from the main .NET application and saves them in a Hashtable. The new service then at certain time intervals goes to the database once to do batch inserts and updates. The point was to go to the database less frequently. Although this had a positive effect it didn't benefit to the system load as much as I expected. The most of the cpu load comes from oracle.exe as requests per second increase. </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to avoid going to the database as much as I can and the only way to avoid DB seems to be increasing the cache hit ratio other than the above mentioned solution I tried. My cache hit ratio is around 81 % percent currently. Because each local machine has its own cache I am actually missing lots of cacheable requests. When two similar requests redirects to different servers the second request cannot benefit from the cached result of the first one. </p>\n\n<p>I don't have a lot of experience in system architecture so I would appreciate any help to this problem. Any suggestions on different caching architectures or setup, or any tools are welcome. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance, hopefully I made my question clear.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","oracle","sqlplus","webrick"],"answer_count":8,"favorite_count":24,"up_vote_count":46,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6461,"score":46,"question_id":1156759,"title":"Webrick is very slow to respond.

So, having additional index of such a table is redundant. However, a table with 100.000 records should not be considered as small but explain plan from such a table shows performed table full scan. So, I did small experiment on my laptop with Oracle installed locally: </p>\n\n<p>1) first, created my_table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE my_table(\n  \"ID\" NUMBER NOT NULL ENABLE, \n  \"INVOICE_NO\" VARCHAR2(10), \n  CONSTRAINT \"test _PK\" PRIMARY KEY (\"ID\")\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2) Then, created index for invoice_no column (because will filter using it):</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE INDEX \"my_table_index1\" ON my_table (invoice_no)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3) Then, inserted 100K records:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DECLARE\n  mod_val NUMBER;\nBEGIN\n  FOR i IN 1..100000 LOOP\n    mod_val := MOD(i,6);\n    IF (mod_val = 0) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-110');\n    ELSIF (mod_val = 1) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-111');\n    ELSIF (mod_val = 2) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-112');\n    ELSIF (mod_val = 3) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-113');\n    ELSIF (mod_val = 4) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-114');\n    ELSIF (mod_val = 5) THEN\n      INSERT INTO my_table (ID, INVOICE_NO) VALUES (i, '5570-115');\n    END IF; \n  END LOOP;\n  COMMIT;\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4) Then updated one random record (just for emphasizing the select):</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n  UPDATE my_table SET INVOICENO = 'exception' WHERE id = 50000;\n  COMMIT;\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5) Then performed select with explain plan:</p>\n\n<pre><code>EXPLAIN PLAN FOR\n  SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE invoice_no = 'exception';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>6) Then grabbed the statistics:</p>\n\n<pre><code> SELECT * FROM TABLE(dbms_xplan.display);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>7) and got the results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"PLAN_TABLE_OUTPUT\"\n\"Plan hash value: 3804444429\"\n\" \"\n\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\"| Id  | Operation         | Name     | Rows  | Bytes | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |\"\n\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\"|   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |          | 83256 |  1626K|   103   (1)| 00:00:02 |\"\n\"|   1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| MY_TABLE | 83256 |  1626K|   103   (1)| 00:00:02 |\"\n\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\" \"\n\"Note\"\n\"-----\"\n\"   - dynamic sampling used for this statement (level=2)\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It's strange and smells \"magic\", why Oracle decided not to use the index on invoice_no field and scanned 83256 records?

I agree with that but it's strange why it didn't selected the right approach for this test case when I just created, inserted and performed the select.

So Oracle promotes DATE value in the DB to timestamp before performing date comparisons. This results in poor performance because database indexes are skipped. The option of changing column type from DATE to TIMESTAMP is ruled out because it requires more space and our application does not require precision beyond seconds. Thus I plan to write a userType that converts DateTime to oracle.sql.DATE and set the parameter in preparedStatement so that there is no index mismatch.
