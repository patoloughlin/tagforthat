These are done inside pure virtual functions from the base class. </p>\n\n<p>Now, when the user creates, uses and is finished with the object, he should call the <code>Done</code> function (from base class), which will do cleanup and resource de-allocation. Part of this cleanup is to call a number of API-level functions -- these naturally are pure virtuals in the base class and implemented in the derived classes. So far so good.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem. If the user <strong>does not</strong> explicitly call <code>Done</code> there will be various memory leaks due to resources not being properly freed. So, I figured I'd make it easy and call <code>Done</code> from <code>~BaseClass()</code> - automatic cleanup on destruction, i thought. Well, not so much.

What I'm looking for is a way to fix this. Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.DomainClasses\n//POCO classes mapped on Entity Framework.\n\n//Project/Namespace DataAccessLayer.Base\n//Base classes and interfaces for all data access layer, such as:\n\npublic abstract class BaseContext&lt;TContext&gt; : DbContext where TContext : DbContext\n{\n  //To allow multiple contexts sharing the same connection string\n  protected BaseContext(): base(\"name=MyConnectionString\") {}\n}\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; : IDisposable where T : class\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write repository\npublic interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Basic implementation for a read-only repository\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Basic implementation for a read/write repository\npublic abstract class BaseRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Project DataAccessLayer.AccountContext/ Namespace DataAccessLayer\n//Context class:\n\npublic class AccountContext : BaseContext&lt;AccountContext&gt; {}\n\n//With this, I can have simple repositories:\n\npublic class UserRepository : BaseRepository&lt;AccountContext, User&gt;\n{ //All implementation comes from the base abstract class, unless I need to change it (override methods)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a service layer between data access and the application (Windows Forms). Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services\n//Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only service working with a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class {}\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write service working with a read/write repository\npublic interface IService&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Base implementation for a read-only service\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyService&lt;T, R&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Base implementation for a read/write service\npublic abstract class BaseService&lt;T, R&gt; : IService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Concrete sample service\npublic class UserService : BaseService&lt;User, UserRepository&gt;\n{ //As with the repository I can change the default behavior of implementation overriding methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this setup, the only way to compile is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer project.\nHow can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework there?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs (DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code).</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><em>--Edit--Including here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the question--</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three (domain, base data layer and context). My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if it's really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, it's going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too? What's making VS require this?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, I'm inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.</p>\n\n<p>One possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=4.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to avoid having these references? What improvements can I have on this structure?</p>\n\n<p>What I know is that my app certainly doesn't have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. It's a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever (except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget).

Their case centers on the assertion that in the majority of cases a bool parameter signifies that the method actually does two things, one branch for the true case and a second branch for the false case. </p>\n\n<p>Other guidance would tell us that our methods should aim to do one thing and that the <code>if/else</code> should really call out to two methods, one for the true case and the other for the false case. Advocates of this approach say that it will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make unit testing the code easier as you can test smaller blocks</li>\n<li>Help reduce copy/paste of code blocks as single purpose methods are more reusable</li>\n<li>Helps readability by avoiding calling code like <code>DoAbc(true,false,false,true);</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I do agree that from the callers perspective, methods with multiple bool parameters make it hard to work out what the method is actually doing. For example, how is <code>DoAbc(false, false);</code> any different from <code>DoAbc(true, false);</code> I guess right now I rely on intellisense to tell me the parameters names and hope they explain the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Opinion seems to be that methods with one bool type param probably have two code blocks, one for each case. The suggestions seems to be to extract each case to a new method, name the methods appropriately and keep the <code>if/else</code> in the parent method. Alternatively the caller can do the <code>if</code> check (assuming it can take on that responsibility) and call the appropriate one of the two methods. </p>\n\n<p>For methods with more than one bool type param, the suggestion is to consider the use of enumerations along with the extract method approach.

It seems like Drupal is now doing the same thing, except for the web.</p>\n\n<p>This is definitely good in some aspects, but it seems to have some drawbacks as well. From the perspective of someone with a few years of Web development experience and programming experience, it seems like Drupal has some quirks that take some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>OOP and Namespaces</strong>: Drupal pretty much re-invents Object Oriented programming with its own internal API, and there does not seem to be much impetus to change that, even though PHP has added built-in support for (its own flavor of) OOP. <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/19964\" rel=\"nofollow\">See Drupal on OOP</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>It works for me ...:</strong> Many contrib modules seem to be plagued by use cases that were not initially anticipated by the original author(s). The common response is \"well, at least it works for me\". This is understandable when developers write something first to solve their own particular issues, and then only later adapt it for others (if funding, personal preferences, and time allow). The problem is \"good enough for me\" is an incremental approach that does not work well with large-scale development. The result is a combination of solutions that feel \"duct taped\" together. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Duplicated Standards:</strong> Drupal seems to also re-invent existing technologies and standards even in cases where there does not seem to be a stylistic or strategic benefit in doing so. For example: 1) New .info files; 2) Deployment tools; 3) Re-creation of PHP language features; 4) Re-creation of code and functionality from established open-source libraries.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(The newly-invented <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/171205\" rel=\"nofollow\">.info files</a> (used in configs), are used instead of already built-in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\" rel=\"nofollow\">INI file</a> format of PHP, or the already-used and published <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json\" rel=\"nofollow\">JSON</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\" rel=\"nofollow\">YAML</a>, for cases where INI is not powerful enough. Another example, in contrib modules at least, you can find lots of hand-made regexes used to parse HTML, instead of already-developed full-fledged HTML parsers. Another example, <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/drush\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drush</a> appears instead of any already-known <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software\" rel=\"nofollow\">build language</a> out there (<strong>EDIT</strong>: the build language link is not a good one, I meant to emphasize higher-level tools like Rake, Capistrano, Ant, Maven and others, I am assuming Drush is the closest thing.))</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit testing:</strong> Drupal does not seem to have a strong support for unit testing. Combined with the other factors above, this makes for a challenging environment for those who want to have comprehensive code coverage, especially for cases where Drupal is being used in a work environment with the potential for lots of apps proliferating.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> If you have some Drupal experience, and also some programming experience (especially if it is in other languages in addition to PHP, with native support for OOP), what are some specific pitfalls or even advantages that you have encountered?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","pointers"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":0,"question_id":13274831,"title":"C++ object dynamic naming","body":"<p>I am new to object oriented programming with c++.

For example, we have a <code>Sub Class</code> file that generates HTML for us, saving us time in areas that would require rewriting the same HTML code again.</p>\n\n<p>We also have created a wrapper function called <code>run()</code>. We use this wrapper function for interacting anywhere in the website. <code>run()</code>, will make a request to the <code>Main Class</code> and ask for access to <code>Sub Class</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Main Class</code> will determine whether or not that <code>Sub Class</code> file, and <code>Sub Class</code> method exists and is callable. If everything succeeds, the request made from anywhere in the website is then sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> from the <code>Main Class</code>. <em>Keeping in mind of course that the original request was sent to the <code>run()</code> method, and was then validated by the <code>Main Class</code>, before the request was actually sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> AND... has already been instantiated by the <code>Main Class</code>.</em></p>\n\n<p>However, as we amend our code, this setup has seemingly drifted beyond our control.

I've tried to find a good tutorial for c# that uses test driven development, but haven't been able to find anything worthwhile in that vein.  Anyway, after spending a few days reading about it, I decided the best way to learn is by experience, so I started creating a small app using those principles best I can.  </p>\n\n<p>It's a simple bowling score calculator.  I figured the best way to go about it was to work from the simplest part up, so I started at the ball (or throw) level.  Right now I have created tests and an interface and class for dealing with ball(throw) scores, which makes sure they aren't invalid, ie. <code>&lt;10</code> or <code>&gt;0</code>.  After implementing this I realized that the ball class is basically just a nullable integer, so maybe I don't even need it... but for now it's there.</p>\n\n<p>Following the ball, I decided the next logical thing to add was a frame interface and class.  This is where I have gotten stuck.  Here is where I'm at:</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace BowlingCalc.Frames\n{\n    public interface IFrame : BowlingCalc.Generic.ICheckValid\n    {\n        void AddThrow(int? score);\n        int? GetThrow(int throw_number);\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace BowlingCalc.Frames\n{\n    public class Frame : IFrame\n    {\n        private List&lt;Balls.IBall&gt; balls;\n        private Balls.IBall ball;\n        private int frame_number;\n\n        public Frame(Balls.IBall ball, int frame_number)\n        {\n            this.ball = ball;\n            this.frame_number = frame_number;\n            balls = new List&lt;Balls.IBall&gt;();\n            check_valid();\n        }\n\n        public void AddThrow(int? score)\n        {\n            var current_ball = ball;\n            current_ball.Score = score;\n            balls.Add(current_ball);\n        }\n\n        public int? GetThrow(int throw_number)\n        {\n            return balls[throw_number].Score;\n        }\n\n        public void check_valid()\n        {\n            if (frame_number &lt; 0 || frame_number &gt; 10)\n            {\n                throw (new Exception(\"InvalidFrameNumberException\"));\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The frame uses my previously implemented ball class through dependency injection to add ball scores to the frame.  It also implements a way to return the score for any given ball in the frame.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do, and where I'm stuck, is I want to add a way to make sure the frame score is valid. (For the moment just the simple case of frames 1-9, where the combined score of both balls must be 10 or less.  I will move on to the  much more complicated frame 10 case later.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is I have no idea how to implement this in a SOLID way.  I was thinking of adding the logic into the class, but that seems to go against the single responsibility principle.  Then I thought to add it as a separate interface/class and then call that class on each frame when its score updates.  I also thought of creating a separate interface, <code>IValidator</code> or something like that, and implementing that in the Frame class.  Unfortunately, I have no idea which, if any, of these is the best/SOLID way of doing things.</p>\n\n<p>So, what would be a good, SOLID way to implement a method that validates the score of a frame?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: Any critique of my code is very welcome.

Clearly, such code would be safe:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Base a = new Derived();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since going up the inheritance hierarchy is safe, but</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dervied b = (Base)a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is not guarenteed safe, since going down is not safe.</p>\n\n<p>But, regardless of the safety, such downcasts are valid in many languages (like Java or C#) - the code will compile, and will simply fail at runtime if the types aren't right. So technically, the code is still safe, but via runtime checks and not compile-time checks (btw, I'm not a fan of runtime checks).</p>\n\n<p>I would personally find complete compile-time type safety to be very important, at least from a theoretical perspective, and at most from the perspective of reliable code. A consequence of compile-time type safety is that casts are no longer needed (which I think is great, 'cause they're ugly anyways). Any cast-like behaviour can be implemented by an implicit conversion operator or by a constructor.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering, are currently any OO languages which provide such a rigourous type safety at compile-time that casts are obsolete? I.e., they don't any allow unsafe conversion operations whatsoever? Or is there a reason this wouldn't work?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any input.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>If I can clarify by example, here's the big reason I hate downcasts so much.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I have the following (loosely based on C#'s collections):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\n{\n     IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();\n\n     IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Filter( Func&lt;T, bool&gt; );\n}\n\npublic class List&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\n{\n    // All of list's implementation here\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now suppose someone decides to write code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;int&gt; list = new List&lt;int&gt;( new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} );\n// Let's filter out the odd numbers\nList&lt;int&gt; result = (List&lt;int&gt;)list.Filter( x =&gt; x % 2 != 0 );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the cast is necessary on that last line. But is it valid? Not in general. Sure, it makes sense that the implementation of <code>List&lt;T&gt;.Filter</code> will return another <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, but this is not guarenteed (it could be any subtype of <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>). Even if this runs at one point in time, a later version may change this, exposing how brittle the code is.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much all of the situations I can think that require downcasts would boil down to something like this example - a method has a return type of some class or interface, but since we know some implementation details, we're confident in downcasting the result. But this is anti-OOP, since OOP actually encourages abstracting from implementation details. So why do we do it anyways, even in purely OOP languages?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","java","c++","oop"],"answer_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":13,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":917,"score":12,"question_id":2289642,"title":"The best learning route into Object Oriented Programming from C?","body":"<p>What is the best route to go for learning OOP if one has done some programming in C.</p>\n\n<p>My intention was first to take the natural leap and \"increment with one\" and go for Stroustrup.

Thanks to the answer I understood that it should be \"final\" and \"static\" (since it is a constant set and it will not be associated with any particular instance, it just should be visible to all instances of the class). However I still have a problem. I wanted to specify the set using \"add\" and I cannot add to the set if it is constant (final). Moreover, I cannot change values of the variables outside methods (why?). Anyway, I do not insist on the usage of \"add\" to define the set. I am ready to define it at once. But I do not know how to do it. I tried things like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>final static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet(\"aaa\",\"bbb\");\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet([\"aaa\",\"bbb\"]);\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet({\"aaa\",\"bbb\"});\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet(Arrays.asList({\"userName\"}));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And they did not work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDED 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Can anybody explain me, pleas, the code given by Tadeusz Kopec?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class YourClass {\n    private static void fillSet(Set&lt;SomeType&gt; set) {\n        // here you add elements, like\n        set.add(new SomeType());\n    }\n    private final static Set&lt;SomeType&gt; yourSetField;\n    static {\n        final Set&lt;SomeType&gt; tempSet = new HashSet&lt;SomeType&gt;();\n        fillSet(tempSet);\n        yourSetField = Collection.unmodifiableSet(tempSet);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br>1. The <code>fillSet</code> method has one variable called \"set\". Why it is not used in the method?\n<br>2. What is <code>SomeType()</code> in the <code>fillSet</code>? What does this method do?\n<br>3. What does <code>fillSet</code> do? Later in the example we give an empty set to this method. What for?\n<br>4. What for do we declare <code>tempSet</code> as final?\n<br>5. What exactly <code>unmodifiableSet</code> do? According to the name it generate a set which cannot be modified, I think. But why would it be insufficient to declare <code>yourSetField</code> as <code>final</code>? Than it would be constant too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","good-design"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":13232322,"title":"OO programming in layers - how to retrieve object","body":"<p>i'm wondering which is the best way to retrieve an object that contains data from two tables.\nIn my case I want to retrieve a portfolio item which has data in the portfolioItem table and a separate table with the images.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm struggling for which is the best way to retrieve these items in an object.\nIn the first way I retrieve everything at once in my Data class and return the complete object while the second way builds the object from two different data classes (one for the general portfolio information and one for the images).</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm just wondering, is there a way which is beter than the other or are both ways acceptable?\nIs it ok to get all the data at once or should I break it up pieces like the second way?</p>\n\n<p>I have two tables: portfolioItem and portfolioItemImage\nI have a class like</p>\n\n<pre><code>PortfolioItem{\n    public $portfolioItemId;\n    public $name;\n    public $images //array\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$dataPortfolioItem = new DataPortfolioItem();\n$theItem = $dataPortfolioItem-&gt;getPortfolioItem(5);\nDataPortfolioItem{\n    public function getPortfolioItem($theId){\n        //create a new portfolio item\n        //get the portfolio data from portfolioItem table and fill in the id and name\n        //get the image data from image table and set the images array from the object\n        //return the object with the data and images included\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$dataPortfolioItem = new DataPortfolioItem();\n$theItem = $dataPortfolioItem-&gt;getPortfolioItem(5);\n$dataPortfolioItemImages = new DataPortfolioItemImages();\n$theItem-&gt;images = $dataPortfolioItemImages-&gt;getPortfolioItemImages(5)\n\nDataPortfolioItem{\n    public function getPortfolioItem($theId){\n        //create a new portfolio item\n        //get the portfolio data from portfolioItem table and fill in the id and name\n        //return the portfolio item     \n    }\n}\n\nDataPortfolioItemImage{\n    public function getPortfolioItemImages($theId){\n        //get the images from the database table and return them in an array\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["oop","class-design"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":520,"score":2,"question_id":1699661,"title":"Design classes - OOPS features","body":"<p><br>\nActually I am interested in improving my designing capability(designing of classes with its properties, methods etc) when a problem is given.\nie How to decide what could be the classes involved? and then decide the methods and properties?\nCan you guys suggest me good material for improving on this.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,<br>\nJustin Samuel.</p>\n"},{"tags":["language-agnostic","oop","inheritance","composition","aggregation"],"answer_count":25,"favorite_count":155,"up_vote_count":257,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":35163,"score":254,"question_id":49002,"title":"Prefer composition over inheritance?","body":"<p>Why prefer composition over inheritance?

Having no experience with generics and only average experience with creating good OOP designs, this is beginning to prove quite a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I have some feeling that what I'm trying to do cannot actually be done, but that I could come close enough to it. I'll try to explain it as brief as I can. I'm just going to tell straight away that this structure will represent my DAO and service layers to access the database. Making this question more abstract would only make it more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>My DAO layer is completely fine as it is. There is a generic DAO interface and for each entity, there is a DAO interface that extends the generic one and fills in the generic types. Then there's an abstract class that is extended by each DAO implementation, which in turn implement the corresponding interface. Confusing read for most probably, so here's the diagram showing the DAO for Products as an example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ncmi.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing the DAO implementation for Product entities\"></p>\n\n<p>Now for the service classes, I had a similar construction in mind. Most of the methods in a service class map to the DAO methods anyway. <strong>If you replace every \"DAO\" in the diagram above with \"Service\", you get the basis for my service layer.</strong> But there is one thing that I want to do, based on the following idea I have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every service class for an entity will at least access one DAO object, namely the DAO of the entity that it is designed for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is...</p>\n\n<h1>The question/problem</h1>\n\n<p>If I could make a proper OO design to <strong>make each service class have one instance variable for the DAO object of their respective entity</strong> my service layer would be perfect, in my view. <strong>Advice on this is welcome, in case my design is not so good as it seemed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have implemented it like this:</p>\n\n<h2>Class AbstractService</h2>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractService&lt;EntityDAO&gt; {\n\n    EntityDAO entityDAO;\n\n    public AbstractService() {\n        entityDAO = makeEntityDAO(); //compiler/IDE warning: overridable method call in constructor\n    }\n\n    abstract EntityDAO makeEntityDAO();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Class ProductServiceImpl</h2>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProductServiceImpl extends AbstractService&lt;ProductDAOImpl&gt; {\n\n    public ProductServiceImpl() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    ProductDAOImpl makeEntityDAO() {\n        return new ProductDAOImpl();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>The problem with this design is a compiler warning I don't like: it has an overridable method call in the constructor</strong> (see the comment). Now it is <strong>designed</strong> to be overridable, in fact I enforce it to <strong>make sure that each service class has a reference to the corresponding DAO.</strong> Is this the best thing I can do?</p>\n\n<p>I have done my absolute best to include everything you might need and only what you need for this question.

OOP not working: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function","body":"<p>Ok, so backstory is we have a bunch of identical (in function) forms on a page to add variants to a product,\nThe form consists of three major parts.</p>\n\n<h1>The Attribute Editor</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jfmsB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component allows the user to add attributes to a product.\nEach attribute has a <code>visibility status</code>, an <code>attribute key</code>, an <code>attribute value</code> and a <code>delete button</code> which together form one row.  </p>\n\n<p>The component also has an <code>Add Attribute</code> button, which when clicked adds a new row to the bottom of the list.</p>\n\n<p>Each <code>attribute key</code> select list has a <code>new attribute</code> option, which upon selecting launches a modal dialog with a form to enter the new attribute name, this form then submits via AJAX and returns an ID, the new option is then appended to every <code>attribute key</code> select on the page to allow it to be selected.</p>\n\n<p>When a key is selected in an instance of the component all other <code>attribute key</code> select's in the group get that option disabled to prevent duplicate attributes.</p>\n\n<p>The attribute editor gets submitted as part of the main form below.\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h1>The Main Form</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVtuw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component consists of the general description fields of the variant.\nThe form is submitted via AJAX and has the <a href=\"https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery Validation Engine</a> attached for form validation.</p>\n\n<p>Because we are adding new input's dynamically with the attribute editor we must constantly detach, and re-attach the validation engine.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>The Alert System</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jDFJC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component handles displaying/hiding the error/success/status messages on form by form basis.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<h1>The Issue</h1>\n\n<p>Now there are also a couple of forms that are very similar, but are slight variantions on a couple of the event handlers, so I wanted to create the code so I could replace bits and pieces of it at will without having to copy the entire code.</p>\n\n<p>So after following the tips from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13223618/new-instance-of-object-acting-as-reference/13224068\">this question</a> I ended up with the code below, but I am getting the error: <code>Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function</code> which is on this line: <code>var variantAlert = new VariantAlert(form);</code> which I believe is because I am not returning anything, but I don't know what

Also you can't protect a 'class', as a 'class' can be changed during execution if the developer accidentally changed it, or meant to change it.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Is there a need in javascript to have an explicitly and controlled separation of class structure and instances of the class?

That is to say you can implement someMethod() in two ways and specify some restrictions. At any point an object will route to the correct method implementation based on its properties. So in the case of if(x > 5) just have two methods that rely on the x attribute</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":16,"up_vote_count":20,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13131,"score":20,"question_id":1343619,"title":"Real world oop example??

Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Meat (name, color, price) {\n    function newPrice (new_price) {\n        this.price = new_price;\n    }\n this.name = name;\n this.color = color;\n this.price = price;\n this.newprice = newPrice;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Fine and dandy. Now I have the ability to assign a price by using Bacon.price or Bacon.newprice.  Personally, this seems like the highest order of semantics, since functionally it does the same thing. But as an advocate for semantic coding, I'll let it slide. Here's what I want:</p>\n\n<p>When I change the value of Bacon.price, the object should include a function to store the old value in a property called oldprice automatically.  I played around with this, but got nowhere. Here's what I've tried so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Meat (name, color, price) {\n    function oldPrice () {\n        this.oldprice = this.price;\n    }\n this.name = name;\n this.color = color;\n this.oldprice = oldPrice;\n this.price = price;\n }\n\n///////////////////////\n\nfunction Meat (name, color, price) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.color = color;\n    this.oldprice = this.price;\n    this.price = price;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>More or less variations of that. I thought that referring to the already assigned value (which would be nothing the first time) before the new value got assigned would be enough. I know that the value (or lack thereof) is stored somewhere before it gets assigned, I just don't know how to refer to it to assign it to the oldvalue property before it gets wiped out.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Okay, maybe the problem is with my eyes or fingers then. Because I thought I had tried the suggestions before asking (I know, I didn't mention them!)

Coming from .Net I would create the interface the rest were based on and move from there, in JavaScript this is not so clear cut.</p>\n\n<p>I understand as a prototypical language JavaScript does not have the notion of interface inheritance, so I am not sure what I have done is a smell or not, as I cant seem to find references, apart from one blog post which tries to infer an interface by using a base abstract class which forces the inheriting classes to implement the function (as it throws).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My base class</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>QueryStrategy = function () {\n\n};\n\nQueryStrategy.prototype.create = function(){\nthrow new Error(\"Not Implemented\");\n}\n\nmodule.exports = QueryStrategy;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Implementation 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>var util = require('util');\nvar QueryStrategy = require('./queryStrategy');\n\nSelectQueryStrategy = function (query) {\n    this.parameters = query.parameters || [];\n    this.entity = query.entity || '';\n};\n\nutil.inherits(SelectQueryStrategy, QueryStrategy);\n\nSelectQueryStrategy.prototype.create = function () {\n    var self = this,\n        params = self.parameters,\n        paramList = self.parameters.length &gt;= 1 ?

Shared functions will come, properties, because of the prototypical chain search i didn't see the point of adding the \"shared\" properties as they are overwritten by the instances created (please if this is wrong, let me know).</p>\n\n<p>Is this an acceptable approach or should I disregard inheritance in this instance.  There may be some type checking and it would make it easier if your could infer the the type to one (i.e. they must all be of the Type QueryStrategy) but I don't want my .Net prejudice to take over here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Approach</strong></p>\n\n<p>Firstly, i am not trying to sell books here, i am just reading a lot around the subject with books that i have, but want to give credit where its due.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the couple of comments, it is correct to say that the type inference won't really make any difference here and possibly should be just left down to Duck Typing to check, and maybe trying to slot something in that is not defined in the language is not the best approach.  I have read in Addy Osmani Javascript patterns about interfaces, although my implementation was not the same, and although interface usage is acceptable, it is probably not needed.</p>\n\n<p>It might be simpler to keep the strategy approach but with a different implementation, one that is outlined in Javascript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov, where you have one implementation and based on some form of configuration you know which strategy to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pseudo Sample</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>QueryBuilder = function () {\n   this.types = [];\n}\n\nQueryBuilder.prototype.create = function (type, query) {\n    var strategy = types[type];\n    strategy.create(query);\n};\n\nQueryBuilder.types.Select = {\n\n    create: function (query) {\n        params = query.parameters,\n        paramList = query.parameters.length &gt;= 1 ? '' : '*';\n\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; params.length; i++) {\n            var suffix = i === (params.length - 1) ? '' : ', ';\n            paramList = paramList + params[i].key + suffix;\n        }\n\n        return util.format(\"SELECT %s FROM %s\", paramList, query.entity);\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That might be a cleaner way to go, one thing i am note sure about is if I should add types to the prototype, but I guess in this simple case it wouldn't be needed, but in a more complex scenario you could have a lot of strategies and in one file might need to be abstracted out. </p>\n\n<p>is this a more acceptable approach?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I ended up with</strong></p>\n\n<p>I looked around and tried to understand more about Duck typing, Pros and Cons etc. and tried to simplify my design based on some of the comments and answer I received. I stuck with the strategy-ish approach in that every strategy defined the same function(s), essentially encapsulating what varied across the implementations and giving them a common contract for want of a better term.  </p>\n\n<p>One thing that changed was the base class/interface which, as correctly pointed was not doing anything constructive was removed, each strategy is independent (so not 100% in the classical representation of the pattern) they, as stated just define the same create function.</p>\n\n<p>From the place where the nested ifs and switches once belonged has been replaced with a single switch which decides which query strategy to use based on the type of query type requested.  This could be re-factored into a factory later on, but for now it serves its purpose:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Query.prototype.generate = function () {\n\nvar self = this,\n    strategy = undefined;\n\nswitch (this.queryType) {\n    case \"SELECT\":\n        strategy = new Select(self);\n        break;\n    case \"INSERT\":\n        strategy = new Insert(self);\n        break;\n    case \"UPDATE\":\n        strategy = new Update(self);\n        break;\n    case \"DELETE\":\n        strategy = new Delete(self);\n        break;\n}\n\nreturn strategy.create();\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each strategy is independently tested, and i feel this is easier to maintain as if something fails, it will fail in one place and investigation will be easier based on the unit tests.  Obviously there is a trade off, more files, and a slightly more complex structure...we will see what happens.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","magento"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13143897,"title":"Magento: adding content managed fields in the backend for a frontend CMS page?","body":"<p>This might be tricky to explain but I'll try my best!</p>\n\n<p>I'm creating fairly basic CMS pages in Magento which are made from standard HTML markup.

An entry in a configuration file determines which of the\naforementioned three types of sources the application will use.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Client {\n    public function foo() {\n        ...\n        Vocabulary::getTerm();\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nclass Supplier {\n    public function bar() {\n        ...\n        Vocabulary::getTerm();\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nclass Vocabulary {\n    public static function useVocab($vocab) {\n        $_SESSION['vocab'] = $vocab;\n    }\n    public static function getTerm($termKey) {...}\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I planned to create Vocabulary child classes for each of the types I want to support, for example: Vocabulary_file, Vocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql.\nVocabulary_file will override its parent useVocab() because it needs to perform additional operations appart from setting the $_SESSION variable, but\nVocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql don't need to override their useVocab() parent method (they just need the $_SESSION variable set).\nAll three Vocabulary \"child\" classes will override getTerm() method.</p>\n\n<p>The following is what I tried and this is the mess I ended up with :-(</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For Vocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql, since useVocab() doesn't exist but is inherited from Vocabulary, \"method_exists()\" returns true and that call\ncauses an infinite loop.</li>\n<li>I looks weird both calling the child explicitly in Vocabulary and calling the parent:: in the child class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After lots of cups of coffee I have exhausted all my wits and my brain is damaged.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Class Vocabulary modified to make it call the desired \"child\" class too\nclass Vocabulary {\n    // This would execute \"child\" class method\n    private static function _callChild($method, $args) {\n        $child_class = 'Vocabulary_' .

There are a lot of other mapping applications online (ridewithgps, strava, runkeeper, to name a few) which treat this kind of data in a different way, yet allow for more or less equivalent \"operations\" with the data. Examples of these operations are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Direct manipulation of tracks/trackpoints with the mouse (including drawing over a map);</li>\n<li>Merging and splitting based on time and/or distance;</li>\n<li>Replacing GPS-collected elevation with DEM/SRTM elevation;</li>\n<li>Calculating properties of part of a track (total ascent, average speed, distance, time elapsed);</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are some small libraries (like <a href=\"https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy/blob/master/gpxpy/gpx.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">GpxPy</a>) that try to model these objects AND THEIR METHODS, in a way that would ideally allow for an encapsulated, possibly language-independent Library/API.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is: this problem is around long enough to allow for a \"common accepted standard\" to emerge, isn't it?

When doing so, yes, the Dependency Graph indeed becomes neater. And when I make changes to certain part, because the classes have little dependency between each other, I don't have to worry about messing up the other classes.</p>\n\n<p>But, by doing this method, sometimes, it appears that I have to repeat some code. For example, I could have the following object that's stored in a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class DataBlock {\n   public int id;\n   public string name;\n   public SomeObject dataObj;\n\n   public Object[] Data1 { get { return dataObj.RetrieveInfo(); } }\n\n   public Object[] Data2 { get { return dataObj.SomeProperty; } }\n\n   public bool DoCompare(obj) { ... }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, there is a list called <code>DataList</code> of the type <code>List&lt;DataBlock&gt;</code> consisting the above object.</p>\n\n<p>And then now, suppose I am going to dispatch an event that will include some information from <code>DataBlock</code>. I could include this whole <code>DataBlock</code> object into the <code>EventArgs</code>. The handler function can then just do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Handler(MyEventArgs evtArgs) {\n   DataBlock data = evtArgs.Data;\n   var firstData = data.Data1;\n   data.Data2;\n   firstData.DoCompare(data.Data2)\n   data.name;  //etc, etc\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is convenient. But, this would also mean that the class that has this handler will then now have dependencies on the <code>DataBlock</code> object. So, one of my ways to get rid of this, is within my <code>EventArgs</code>, I <em>repeat</em> all those informations from <code>DataBlock</code>, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyEventArgs : EventArgs {\n\n   public MyEventArgs(id, name, data1, data2) {\n      ID = id;\n      Name = name;\n      Data1 = data1;\n      Data2 = data2;\n   }\n   public int ID { get; private set; }\n   public string name { get; private set; }\n   public Object[] Data1 { get; private set; }\n   public Object[] Data2  { get; private set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By arranging my <code>EventArgs</code> this way, both my <code>EventArgs</code> and whichever class having the event <code>Handler</code> will not have dependency on the <code>DataBlock</code>. Only the firer of the event knows about the <code>DataBlock</code> and it rips off the data from <code>DataBlock</code> and put them into <code>MyEventArgs</code> via its constructor. However, now, the problem in this is, the <code>MyEventArgs</code> is <em>repeating</em> every getters/setters that is inside <code>Datablock</code>. <strong>And, I also lose access to all helper methods within <code>DataBlock</code>!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is just a small example of a problem that I often face. There are more serious ones where I found myself repeating the getters/settings for a few classes, just because I want to reduce the dependency.</p>\n\n<p>Other problems that I face that show up a lot of arrows on the Dependency Graph, is when, say, I have an interface called <code>ISomeObject</code>. Because the <code>ISomeObject</code> is a popular object within the classes, the interface is used by many other parts of the classes. In the end, there are tons of arrows pointing to the <code>ISomeObject</code>. Would this imply spaghetti code too?</p>\n\n<p>It's difficult for me to explain the problems I face when I want to keep my code organised. But I hope the examples above are enough to illustrate what I want to tell.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the best practices for a scenario like this? Should I determine that my code is spaghetti when the Dependency Graph in Visual Studio shows a lot of messy curvy arrows pointing all over the place?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","oop","class","game"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":0,"question_id":13004463,"title":"why am i getting a global name error","body":"<p>I am currently encountering the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NameError: global name 'player1_unam' is not defined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If somebody could please look through the following code and give me a soultion to the problem it would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I alpologise in advance because I know it is very messy and inefficient code but i am only a beginner in python.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import os \nimport random\nfrom random import randint\ngame_won = False\np1_playing = True\np2_playing = True\nclass start_game(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        suspect = [\"Miss Scarlet\",\"Colonel Mustard\",\"Mrs. White\",\"Reverend Green\",\"Mrs. Peacock\",\"Professor Plum\"] \n        weapon = [\"Candlestick\",\"Dagger\",\"Lead Pipe\",\"Revolver\",\"Rope\",\"Spanner\"]\n        room = [\"Kitchen\",\"Ballroom\",\"Conservatory\",\"Billiard Room\",\"Library\",\"Study\",\"Hall\",\"Lounge\",\"Dining Room\",\"Cellar\"]\n        rndsuspect = random.randrange(0, 5 ,1)\n        rndweapon = random.randrange(0,5,1)\n        rndroom = random.randrange(0,9,1)\n        answers = []\n        answers.append(suspect[rndsuspect])\n        answers.append(weapon[rndweapon])\n        answers.append(room [rndroom])      \n        print answers[0]\n        print answers[1]\n        print answers[2]\n\nclass game_type:\n    def __init__(self):\n        select_game = raw_input(\"Do you want to start the game?

So if another developer wanted to use the method it should be obvious that objects of type X are required without them having to look through the implementation (method body) which is bad encapsulation and breaks the information hiding principle. Secondly because there's no type safety the method can accept any invalid variable which means manual type checking and exception throwing is needed all over the place!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","methods"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13000196,"title":"Method could not be resolved","body":"<p>In my header file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Esame();\nEsame(string);\nEsame(string, Voto);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a c++ tester class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//OK\nEsame esame(\"Algoritmi e strutture dati\", 30);\nesame.stampaEsame();\n\n//OK\nEsame esame2(\"Metodi Avanzati di Programmazione\");\nesame2.setVoto(26);\nesame2.stampaEsame();\n\n//ERROR \nEsame esame3();\nesame3.setVoto(26); //Method could not be resolved\nesame3.stampaEsame(); //Method could not be resolved\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code doesn't compile at all.

Both are intended to minimize hits against a middle-tier or data store:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After fetching ‚ÄúMyRoleProvider‚Äù info from a database, it is subsequently stored in the AuthTicket user-data which in turn means that the auth-cookie holds role-info.  Furthermore, in this story, storing and retrieving this role-info is done by a distinct implementation, entirely outside \"MyRoleProvider.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After fetching ‚ÄúMyRoleProvider‚Äù info from a database, it is subsequently stored in session and accessed from there.  More precisely, the class ‚ÄúMyRoleProvider‚Äù itself will internally access (and update) session when possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Again, both the above stories aim to minimize the latency of hitting an external store by \"caching\" role info.  Both work fine.  The question is, are both design-story choices equally valid?  If not, why?</p>\n\n<h1>The Issue</h1>\n\n<p>There appears to be no \"best practice\" stated anywhere, which says \"your (custom) RoleProvider should always know where role-info is found, whether in session, cache, the database, etc.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Also, there appears to be no (solid) guidance anywhere that explains what kinds of things you should not store in \"<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthenticationticket.userdata.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">userData</a>\" in the authCookie.  What little documentation and guidance there is suggests only two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>'userData' can store additional user information (a vague, broad statement).  I've seen only one code example online, which involved storing additional 3rd party identity/authentication info.</li>\n<li>Do not put too much data in 'userData', because it might make the cookie become too big to be transferred (some browsers limit cookie size).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's it.  From the above guidance, nobody is being expressly told \"it is a best practice to limit the userData only to authentication info.\"  And I certainly have not seen a document which says \"it is a bad idea to put authorization or role-info into 'userData' because...\"</p>\n\n<h1>Deduce a Best Practice?</h1>\n\n<p>My own answer about the two design choices being equal is ‚Äúno.‚Äù  I want to present my argument, and learn from you if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You agree.</li>\n<li>You disagree, because I'm making needless fuss.</li>\n<li>You disagree; although my argument is valid, there are even <em>better</em> arguments of why my thinking ultimately is not right.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully a best-practice concept will emerge as an answer.  Now for my argument(s)...</p>\n\n<h1>My Argument(s)</h1>\n\n<p>I believe the second design-story should be taken, because it represents better modularity: role information is handled completely inside ‚ÄúMyRoleProvider.‚Äù  The first option needlessly intermingles authentication (extracting identify from a cookie) and authorization concerns.  Indeed, all the built-in ASP.NET security mechanisms keep these two topics separate; base ASP.NET functionality never stores role-info in the authcookie.  If anyone wants to confirm this, try reflecting these classes: FormsAuthenticationModule, FormsAuthentication, IPrincipal with RolePrincipal implementaion, and IIdentity with FormsIdentity implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The ASP.NET RolePrincipal deserves a particular highlight.  It permits that role-info is indeed stored in a cookie, but it is a second cookie <em>separate from the auth-cookie</em>.  Furthermore, this peculiar idiom still involves consultation with the RoleProvider.  See the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b23yh35t%28v=vs.100%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">example section of this MSDN documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Investigating RolePrincipal further, let's look at RolePrincipal.IsInRole().  Although any such IPrincipal derived class combines identity and role information programmatically, the internal implementation still maintains the RoleProvider as the only source of role information (note the reference to <code>Roles.RoleProviders...</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public bool IsInRole(string role)\n    {\n        if (this._Identity != null)\n        {\n            if (!this._Identity.IsAuthenticated || role == null)\n            {\n                return false;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                role = role.Trim();\n                if (!this.IsRoleListCached)\n                {\n                    this._Roles.Clear();\n                    string[] rolesForUser = Roles.Providers[this._ProviderName].GetRolesForUser(this.Identity.Name);\n                    string[] strArrays = rolesForUser;\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)strArrays.Length; i++)\n                    {\n                        string str = strArrays[i];\n                        if (this._Roles[str] == null)\n                        {\n                            this._Roles.Add(str, string.Empty);\n                        }\n                    }\n                    this._IsRoleListCached = true;\n                    this._CachedListChanged = true;\n                }\n                return this._Roles[role] != null;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new ProviderException(SR.GetString(\"Role_Principal_not_fully_constructed\"));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This kind of ASP.NET ‚Äúone-stop‚Äù deep-assumption of where role information is found, is why role info should be consolidated into the RoleProvider.  In short I claim:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you <em>do</em> store role info in a cookie, the reason why ASP.NET does not have a built-in capability to combine that into the auth-cookie, is precisely because ASP.NET maintains strongly a separation of concerns between the different providers.</li>\n<li>Any RoleProvider should be aware of where role-info might be found, whether in a cookie, session, or otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Conclusion:</h1>\n\n<p>Do not put role-info into the auth-cookie, and ensure your (custom) RoleProvider <em>knows</em> all the places where role info is found, whether the database, a web service, session, cache, or a cookie.</p>\n\n<p>Agree?

I'm not sure how to split up this question, sorry if it's asking too many things. I'm suffering from information overload!</p>\n\n<p>I expect the JS will requests JSON objects from a single PHP file. I'd like a minimal but effective pattern for PHP to respond to requests that is concise and effective. Perhaps the JS would invoke model-like objects which query a database and return JSON to the client. </p>\n\n<p>What would be a good pattern for the PHP side? I've hacked together a PHP file which messily has a large switch statement parsing for instructions from the client, with associated data. A single request could contain multiple instructions. For example, javascript sends a request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\n    url: '/ajax.php', dataType: 'json',\n    data: {instructions: [{\n        instruction: \"newPerson\",\n        data: {\n             name: person.name,\n             email: person.email\n             city: person.city\n        }\n    }]},\n    success: callback, error: ajaxFail\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The callback would be a global handler dealing with any objects the PHP returns, from this request or others. For example, the above might receive a new person object with the person ID generated by PHP inserting into the DB, as well as a city object also with its ID. Other requests might also return those objects, so a single handler makes sense? (One question would be how the javascript associates the returned objects with the insertion submitted)</p>\n\n<p>I'm ashamed by my PHP page code, but it looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$return = array();\n$instructions = $_REQUEST['instructions'];\nforeach ($instructions as $instruction){\n    switch($instruction['instruction']){\n        case 'findPoeple':\n            $data = $instruction['data'];\n            $res = DB::query(\"select player from person where player like '%\". DB::esc($str) .\"%'\");\n            $return['players'] = array();\n            while ($row = DB::fetch($res)){\n                $return['players'][] = $row['player'];\n            }\n        break;\n        case 'loadAllPeople':\n            // similar code\n        break;\n        case 'newPerson':\n            // similar code\n        break;\n        default:\n            die(\"command '$command' not recognised\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\necho json_encode($return);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly there's too much wrong with this to say what to change!

Couple of interesting design pickles","body":"<p>I'm designing a new power-up system for a game I'm creating. It's a side scroller, the power ups appear as circular objects and the player has to touch / move through them to pick up their power. The power up then becomes activated, and deactivates itself a few seconds later. Each power-up has its own duration defined. For simplicity's sake the power ups are spawned (placed on the screen) every X seconds.</p>\n\n<p>I created a PowerUpManager, a singleton whose job is to decide when to create new power ups and then where to place them.</p>\n\n<p>I then created the Powerup base class, and a class that inherits from that base class for every new Powerup. Every Power-up can be in one of three states: Disabled, placed on the screen, and picked up by the player. If the player did not pick up the power up but moved on, the power up will exit the screen and should go back from the placed state to the disabled state, so it can be placed again.</p>\n\n<p>One of the requirements (that I) put in place is that there should be minimal code changes when I code up a new Power up class. The best I could do was one piece of code: The PowerUpManager's constructor, where you must add the new power-up to the to the container that holds all power-ups:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PowerupManager::PowerupManager()\n{\n    available = {\n        new PowerupSpeed(),\n        new PowerupAltWeapon(),\n        ...\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The PowerUpManager, in more details (Question is coming up!):\nHolds a vector of pointers to PowerUp (The base class) called available. This is the initial container that holds one copy of each power up in the game.\nTo handle the different states, it has a couple of lists: One that holds pointers to currently placed power ups, and another list that holds pointers to currently active power ups.\nIt also has a method that gets called every game tick that decides if and where to place a new power up and clean up power ups that weren't picked up. Finally it has a method that gets called when the player runs into a power up, that activates the power up (Moves it from the placed to the active list, and calls the power up's activate method).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once you understand the full picture, the question:\nI needed a way for client code to ask if a particular power-up is currently active. For example: The player has a weapon, but there is a power up that replaces that weapon temporarily. Where I poll for input and recognize that the player wants to fire his weapon, I need to call the correct fire method - The alternative weapon power up fire method, and not the regular weapon fire method.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of this particular demand for a while and came up with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nT* isActivated() // Returns a pointer to the derived Powerup if it exists in the activated list, or nullptr if it doesn't\n{\n    for(Powerup *i : active) // Active is a list of currently active power ups\n    {\n        T *result = dynamic_cast&lt;T*&gt;(i);\n\n        if(result)\n            return result;\n    }\n\n    return nullptr;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So client code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PowerUpAltWeapon *weapon = powerUpManager-&gt;isActivated&lt;PowerUpAltWeapon&gt;();\nif(weapon)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I thought the solution is elegant and kind of neat, but essentially what it is is trying to convert a base type to a derived type. If that doesn't work, you try the next derived type... A long chain of if / else if, it's just disguised in a loop. Does this violate the guideline that I just described? Not casting a base type to all of its derived types in a long chain of if / else if until you get a hit? Is there another solution?</p>\n\n<p>A secondary question is: Is there a way to get rid of the need to construct all the different power ups in the PowerupManager constructor? That is currently the only place you need to make a change if you want to introduce a new power up. If I can get rid of that, that'd be interesting...</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","oop","delphi-7","delphi-xe2","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":138,"score":5,"question_id":12871142,"title":"How can I declare an array property?","body":"<p>I constructed class system</p>\n\n<pre><code>  TTableSpec=class(Tobject)\n  private\n    FName : string;\n    FDescription : string;\n    FCan_add : Boolean;\n    FCan_edit : Boolean;\n    FCan_delete : Boolean;\n    FFields : array[1..100] of TFieldSpec;\n  public\n    property Name: String read FName;\n    property Description: String read FDescription;\n    property Can_add : Boolean read FCan_add;\n    property Can_edit : Boolean read FCan_edit;\n    property Can_delete : Boolean read FCan_delete;\n    property Fields : array read FFields;\n  end;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus in TableSpec Fields property shall be the list of fields (I used TFieldSpec array).

This is simple aggregation and is handled in the DB by the Position table holding an Account ID as a foreign key.</p>\n\n<p>We now need to extend this 'downwards' with <strong>Trades</strong> and <strong>Portfolios</strong>. One or more Trades make up a Position (but a Trade is not a Position in itself) and one or more Portfolios make up an Account (but a Portfolio is not an Account in itself). Trades are associated with Portfolios just like Positions are associated with Accounts ('has a'). Note that it is still possible to have a Position without Trades and an Account without Portfolios (i.e. it is not mandatory to have all the existing objects broken down in subcomponents).</p>\n\n<p>My first idea was to go simply for the following (the first two classes already exist):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Account;\nclass Position {\n  Account account;\n}\nclass Portfolio {\n  Account account;\n}\nclass Trade {\n  Position position;\n  Portfolio portfolio;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think the (potential) problem is clear: starting from Trade, you might end up in different Accounts depending if you take the Position route or the Portfolio route. Of course this is never supposed to happen and the code that creates and stores the objects should never be able create such an inconsistency.

So, I made an abstract class - Node. Any content must have a specific content type. With OO, this is easy - I make a Person class that extends Node, or an Event class that extends Node, etc. Now comes the tricky part - part of my project allows these nodes to be \"included\" in other nodes. That is, if Node A includes Node B, then whenever A is displayed, the data from B is displayed. This means that whenever Node A is instantiated, it needs to instantiate Node B as well. BUT...Node is an abstract class. So, I can't instantiate a raw Node. I have to instantiate one of its implementing classes. So, as far as I can tell, I either need to write an abstract, static function that all extending classes must implement that returns the constructor...OR, I need to use reflection in some way to determine type, and somehow call the appropriate class constructor? </p>\n\n<p>Without regard to Drupal, what is the most appropriate way to handle this issue from a PHP/OO programming standpoint?</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nabstract class Node {\n\n    public $title, $short_summary, $full_summary, $body, $uri, $machine_type_name, $included_content;\n\n    public function __construct($node) {\n\n        ##\n        ## Set simple values\n        $this-&gt;title = $node-&gt;title;\n        $this-&gt;body = $node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'];\n\n        ##\n        ## Set clean uri if aliased\n        if (drupal_lookup_path('alias', 'node/'.$node-&gt;nid)) {\n            $this-&gt;uri = '/'.drupal_lookup_path('alias', 'node/'.$node-&gt;nid);\n        } else {\n            $this-&gt;uri = '/node/'.$node-&gt;nid;\n        }\n\n        ##\n        ## Set short summary if exists, else short form of body text\n        if(strlen($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_summary'])) {\n            $this-&gt;short_summary = $node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_summary'];\n        } else {\n            $this-&gt;short_summary = text_summary($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'], NULL, 100);\n        }\n\n        ##\n        ## Set full summary to concatenation of body\n        $this-&gt;full_summary = text_summary($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'], NULL, 600);\n\n        ##\n        ## Add included content if module is enabled\n        if (module_exists('content_inclusion')) {\n            // is this possible?

I would also like to perform this exact same task on other classes as well.  The obvious solution is to write a function in a separate M file that all the classes call in order to perform this task.  However, that seems impossible in Matlab (see below).  Is there another way to accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the problem specifically: suppose I have one m file with the contents</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef PrivateTest\n    properties (Access=private)\n        a\n    end\n\n    methods\n        function this = directWrite(this, v)\n            this.a = v;\n        end\n        function this = sameFileWrite(this, v)\n            this = writePrivate(this, v);\n        end\n        function this = otherFileWrite(this, v)\n            this = otherFileWritePrivate(this, v);\n        end\n        function print(this)\n            disp(this.a);\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction this = writePrivate(this, v)\n    this.a = v;\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and another m file with the contents</p>\n\n<pre><code>function this = otherFileWritePrivate(this, v)\n    this.a = v;\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After instantiating <code>p = PrivateTest</code>, both of these commands work fine (as expected):</p>\n\n<pre><code>p = p.directWrite(1);\np = p.sameFileWrite(2);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but this command doesn't work even though it's the same code, just in a different m file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p = p.otherFileWrite(3);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it seems like any code that performs operations on private properties of a class MUST be in the same m file as the classdef that defines those private properties.  Another possibility might be to have all the classes inherit a class with the writing method, but Matlab doesn't allow this either.  In one m file, I would have this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef WriteableA\n    methods\n        function this = inheritWrite(this, v)\n            this.a = v;\n        end\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and in another m file I would have this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef PrivateTestInherit &lt; WriteableA\n    properties (Access=private)\n        a\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, after instantiating <code>p = PrivateTestInherit;</code>, the command <code>p.inheritWrite(4)</code> causes the same error message as before: \"Setting the 'a' property of the 'PrivateTestInherit' class is not allowed.\"</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, How is it possible to generalize code that manipulates private properties in Matlab, or is it possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12826126,"title":"How to call a non-static method from another class","body":"<p>This's my second question, even thought, i answered the previous one, on my own.

It seems the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow\">Command Pattern</a> fits the use nicely, but I am unsure how to best implement it.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand the pattern, it is necessary to include in each command:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The details of the paint operation for purposes of redo (e.g. Line -> start &amp; end points, free form line -> <code>GeneralPath</code>)</li>\n<li>The state of the component prior to the change for undo.  In this case, that will be a small snapshot image of the area affected by the command.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My understanding based on that is that each command needs to be 'atomic' or self contained, with all the information needed for undo/redo that operation.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately that would require storing more information than I'd first anticipated.  For a line we must also account for things like the <code>Color</code>, <code>Stroke</code> and <code>RenderingHints</code> used to draw it initially.  This turns my 'simple little commands' into something ..more bulky in memory, and with more boiler-plate code to churn out (each will be a serializable bean<sup>1</sup>).</p>\n\n<p>For reasons of memory conservation (mostly) I was wanting to 'cheat' on the specification of the commands.  Perhaps take a backup of the entire drawing area every 100th update, but otherwise store no part of the changed image, and simply rebuild the last (up to) 100 commands for each new paint operation.  But that seems problematic to ensure that the state of the <code>Graphics</code> object is right before painting each part - this part might require a line, but the <code>RenderingHints</code> were changed 4 commands ago, the <code>Color</code> was changed 98 commands ago, while the <code>Stroke</code> has remained the same for the last 227 commands.</p>\n\n<p>Pursuing a more memory efficient command seems to throw the pattern right out the window in terms of being 'atomic'.  That in turn leads to difficulties in determining the earliest command that might affect the rendering.</p>\n\n<p>Should I:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Look for a new pattern?</li>\n<li>Attempt to implement my peculiar needs by tweaking the pattern?</li>\n<li>Toss all this in the waste bin as premature optimization and code it in the simplest (and most memory consuming) way that sticks to the command pattern as defined?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>\"each will be a serializable bean\"</em>  On 2nd thoughts, no.  I did dome checks to find that a <code>Graphics2D</code> (which neatly encapsulates many parameters used when drawing) is not serializable.  Further, a <code>BasicStroke</code> <strong>is</strong> serializable, but the thickness of the stroke is not stored.  I could create serializable versions of many of the attributes but it seems to make for a lot more code, so I'm going to abandon that spec. as well.  I will only attempt to store a reference to the <code>Graphics2D</code> at run-time.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","oop","class"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":1,"question_id":12789319,"title":"Java: Structure a users control system using OOP","body":"<p>I hope I can explain.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a problem, just I want to know how to build my users system control and I want to know if my idea is correct:</p>\n\n<p>My idea:</p>\n\n<p>*One class (file 1) to functions, methods and operations</p>\n\n<p>*Other class (file 2) to swing elements, buttons, textbox, etc.</p>\n\n<p>*But I don't know how connect these two classes. </p>\n\n<p>For example:: I have 2 textbox (user, password) and one button, then when press the button, send data of each textbox(file 2) to a function (file 1) and process.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any other choice, I'd read it.\nThank you in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","codeigniter-2","codeigniter-datamapper"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":12788979,"title":"Error in CodeIgniter Datamapper when saving relationship","body":"<p>I‚Äôm getting a really strange error.</p>\n\n<p>I have consultants and companies in a database.

This problem is partially solved, if your classes have the suitable names. Also you can break the design patterned class structure you implement, if you're missing some rules writing your code by chance or you're not so experienced in the design patterns. The compilers can protect you and help you to implement the interfaces - if you're not implementing interface, you can't compile your application. It's a good and safe approach. And if the compilers could protect you when you implement design patterns classes too? Look, a lot of programming languages supports \"foreach\" statement. And if the programming languages could provide support for the factories, bridges, proxies, mementos, etc?

No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.</p>\n\n<p>The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the <code>UserManager</code>'s job was allocating and freeing users from the Heap it would not manage the users but to guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a <code>UserSheperd</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe the <code>UserManager</code>'s job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a <code>UserRecordsClerk</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it.  And find this simple idea amazingly hard.</p>\n\n<p>I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly <strong>one</strong> thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, for example with a factory)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)</li>\n<li>Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects their creation and shutdown</li>\n<li>Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)</li>\n<li><p>Nanny - Helps objects reach \"usable\" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects</p></li>\n<li><p>etc etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things in the way as I describe as not-so-important or wrong?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing that issue.

However, I got stuck already.</p>\n\n<p>This is the code I have at the moment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function($, window, undefined) {\n    var Form = function($el) {\n        this.$el = $el;\n        this.fields = {};\n\n        this.prototype.validate = function() {\n            this.getFields();    \n        }\n\n        this.prototype.getFields = function() {\n            console.log(\"getting fields\");\n        }\n\n        return {\n            validate: this.validate\n        }\n    };\n\n    window.Form = Form;\n})(jQuery, window);\n\n\n$(function() {\n\n    var form = new Form('#form-newsletter');\n    form.validate();\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A couple of questions about this.</p>\n\n<p>I wrapped the Form variable in a self-executing function, passing in three parameters. jQuery, window and undefined to make sure it's always undefined. I'm not going to lie, this is how I learnt to do it and I'm not 100% sure why I do it this way. Is this bad practice or could I improve on this somehow? I then expose the Form variable by attaching it to the window.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the <code>Form</code> var, I set some properties (is that how we call them?) and I have a couple of methods. I expose only the validate method in the return statement. Is this okay?</p>\n\n<p>And then the part where I got stuck. I want <code>validate()</code> to be like an initialize function, which has the task of validating the form. Validate should call the getFields function to parse the form fields and put them into the fields object. However, I can't seem to get that working. It doesn't work when I call <code>this.getFields()</code>, <code>this.prototype.getFields()</code> or <code>Form.getFields</code>. Is this because the <code>this</code> inside this function is a different this than the Form object (correct wording here?)?. Should I put something like <code>this.self = this</code> at the start of the Form function?</p>\n\n<p>I'm also wondering if it's okay to attach those methods to the prototype. Is there a reason not to do this? </p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to learn; most books I read about JavaScript focus on the basics: a <code>Dog</code> class which inherits from a <code>Mammal</code> class. However, they don't really help me out with stuff like this, as far as I can tell. Are there any books, tutorials, screencasts out there to help me understand these concepts better?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Say I want to group my scripts under a common namespace: I could do</p>\n\n<pre><code>var MyStuff = {};\n\nMyStuff.Utilities = { // stuff };\nMyStuff.Form = function() { // stuff };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if I want to put these into separate files, like <code>mystuff-form.js</code>, <code>mystuff-utilities.js</code>, how would I go about it? Where do I declare the namespace var <code>var MyStuff = {}</code>? And after I do that, I can just attach my Form and Utilities to that, right? I can hardly make a <code>MyStuff.js</code> file with just <code>var MyStuff = {}; window.MyStuff = MyStuff</code> in it, can I?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","oop","nhibernate"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":0,"question_id":12714021,"title":"Casting from derived type to base type","body":"<p>Given that</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractOrder\n{\n    //some properties...\n}\n\npublic class AnonymousOrder:AbstractOrder\n{\n    //some properties...\n}\n\n\npublic class PartnerOrder:AbstractOrder\n    {\n        //some properties...\n    }\n\n\npublic AbstractOrder FindOrderByConfirmationNumber(string confirmationNumber)\n{\n    ICriteria criteria =\n        Session.CreateCriteria(typeof(AbstractOrder))\n            .SetMaxResults(10)\n            .AddOrder(Order.Desc(\"PurchasedDate\"))\n            .Add(Restrictions.Eq(\"ConfirmationNumber\", confirmationNumber));\n    var l = criteria.List&lt;AbstractOrder&gt;();\n    AbstractOrder ao = l[0] as AbstractOrder;\n    return ao as AbstractOrder;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can someone please explain why</p>\n\n<pre><code>PartnerOrder order = repo.FindOrderByConfirmationNumber(confirmationNumber)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns a type of AnonymousOrder and how I get it to return a type of PartnerOrder?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop","design-patterns","anti-patterns"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12739990,"title":"Is accessing child class from parent class considered anti-pattern","body":"<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class Foo\n{\n    public Bar f1()\n    {\n        return new Bar();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Bar extends Foo\n{\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the design point of view, do you agree this design is anti-pattern?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","css","html5","oop","bug"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":104,"score":0,"question_id":12450648,"title":"a:hover style sticking on iOS browser","body":"<p>I recently released my first open-source project called Shutter Image Gallery and when I was checking to see how it looked on mobile devices (iOS) and noticed a problem that I cannot seem to fix...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1SYSX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the image, the a:hover state on the control buttons seem to stick.

There is an Application object that holds all the data about the insurance application. This includes data about the person insured, the entity that will own the insurance policy, and the entity that will pay for the insurance coverage.</p>\n\n<p>I use the term entity because the policy can be owned (or paid for) by a Person or a Trust. I know when I'm dealing with an Owner or a Payor, but I don't necessarily know if that Owner or Payor is a Person or a Trust. I initially created the Owner interface to cut down on casting and instanceof-based logic. I planned to staple on the Payor interface, but am now second-guessing myself.</p>\n\n<p>That's probably all you need to know for now.

The thing that's giving me pause is the fact that not every Person will be an Owner or a Payor. </p>\n\n<p>As I think about it more, I feel like Owner and Payor aren't \"behaviors\" so much as \"classifications.\" Does that make my use of interfaces here incorrect? If so, do you have any recommendations for alternate solutions? Preferably ones that allow me to continue using Persons and Trusts transparently as Owners and Payors?</p>\n\n<p>Part of my concern comes from less-familiar developers confusing a Person for an Owner like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Application app = new Application();\nPerson timmy = new Person();\nOwner smithFamilyTrust = new Trust();\nPayor steve = new Person();\n\napp.setInsured(timmy);\napp.setOwner(smithFamilyTrust);\napp.setPayor(steve);\n\n...\n\n//this would run, but would be wrong\nif(timmy instanceof Owner){\n   //Do Owner Stuff.\n}\n\n//this would run, and be correct\nOwner owner = app.getOwner();\n//Do Owner Stuff\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Edit to clarify \"Owner Stuff\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point, \"owner stuff\" is simple. Things like getting/setting the owner's id, PIN, or Address:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//I want this\napp.getOwner().getId();\napp.getOwner().getPIN();\napp.getOwner().getAddress();\n\n//I don't want this\nif(app.getOwner() instanceof Person){\n    Person owner = app.getOwner();\n    owner.getId();\n    owner.getPIN();\n    owner.getAddress();\n} else if(app.getOwner() instanceof Trust){\n    Trust owner = app.getOwner();\n    owner.getId();\n    owner.getPIN();\n    owner.getAddress();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Initially I thought I should go with some sort of Entity superclass and have Person and Trust extend that class, but they store and retrieve IDs and PINs differently. The different implementation of the same behavior led me to interfaces. </p>\n\n<p>I could still go with an Entity superclass, but I feel like I can't accurately represent a \"generic\" ID or PIN for that Entity class. I'd have to implement either Person's ID and PIN logic or Trust's ID and PIN logic, then override that in the other class. That feels wrong to me. I suppose Entity could be an abstract class that Person and Trust extend, but I'm not sure that's better than using an interface.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","static","singleton","phpunit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":82,"score":1,"question_id":12719393,"title":"PHP Static Methods/Singleton Pattern","body":"<p>I am designing a new architecture for my company's software product.

The situation is that when sending the mails in response to some input, they should be grouped so a user doesn't receive several consecutive mails with different items but just one with all items included. Also, mails should be grouped by a specific type, that depends on the type of input that created the mail notification, I have the list of inputs, and each one with its specific grouping type, for instance:</p>\n\n<p>Hierarchy: <strong>Employee</strong> has <strong>Processes</strong> has <strong>Requests</strong> has <strong>Activities</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 1:</strong> <em>By Employee</em> (so a receiver will get all notifications of the processes he owns of this activity type in just one mail)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> <em>By Process</em> (a receiver will get a group of all notifications of all requests on this process, and this activity type)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 3:</strong> <em>By Request</em> (activities of this request will be grouped)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 4:</strong> <em>By Activity</em> (each activity will be sent in a separate mail)</p>\n\n<p>This groupings will change constantly.</p>\n\n<p>You may think, well in order to do that inputs should be made at once so mails are generated at the same time and so grouped, otherwise how the system will know when to wait for other inputs and when to just send a separate mail?.. well the answer is both, so what I'm doing is setting a timer so the mail service runs every 5 minutes, some immediate mails might get delayed a few minutes, but that's an affordable trade off.</p>\n\n<p>So I chose to use this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/9194922/920359\">Chain of Responsability Design Pattern</a> and here's the structure:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U8zP4.png\" alt=\"MailGroupingStructure\"></p>\n\n<p>So I have two interfaces <strong>IGroupingType</strong> which defines how each type should be, and has 2 methods: <code>CalculateGrouping()</code>: determines if this is the grouping of the activity. <code>GroupEmailsToSend()</code>: if this is the grouping, gets the mails list.</p>\n\n<p>Interface <strong>IGroupingHandler</strong> is the service class that will call each grouping type, the <code>GetGroupingResult()</code> just calls the 2 methods on the <strong>IGroupingType</strong> concrete implemetations, first <code>CalculateGrouping()</code> to get the correct grouping, when it finds it, calls the <code>GroupEmailsToSend()</code>. This interface also registers the <strong>next</strong> node in the chain for each grouping.</p>\n\n<p>The grouping Enum is just for returning the result of grouping calculations.</p>\n\n<p>And then there's also the <strong>EndOfChainSendingGrouping</strong> class, in case no grouping was found I'll just send the mail right away.</p>\n\n<p>Basicaly I just need some advice on this structure, since I'm kind of new to this pattern, does it have any pitfalls? is there something I can improve? or is there a better way to accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance..</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","oop","design-patterns","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":4,"question_id":12476023,"title":"Can I implement change tracking on a classes that derive from a wsdl imported classes in Delphi 2010?","body":"<p>Is there a way to implement change tracking in a derived class without overriding the getters and setters of the base class?<br/>\nI have an entity framework based multi-tier project in development with the data access and business logic eventually moving to C# based server application.

And those are very similar, except that methods that do things with fruits only call the methods that do things with fruits, and the same thing for vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>I want to refactor this to reduce the duplication, but I'm not sure what is the best way to accomplish that.

Having said that, those similar methods I refer to cannot be inside the \"Plants\" classes, and they usually have another argument, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void createSomethingUsingFruit(Something s, Fruit f);\npublic void createSomethingUsingVegetable(Something s, Vegetable v);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Namely, those methods have other concerns besides Fruits/Vegetables, and aren't really appropriated to be in any Fruit/Vegetable class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Most code in those methods only reads state from the Fruit/Vegetable objects, and create instances of other classes according to the appropriate type, store in the database and so on -- <em>from my answer to a question in the comments that I think it's important</em>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","oop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12695195,"title":"JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)","body":"<p>After searching and reading about how to writing Object Oriented JavaScript, I summarized them in  the below code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/********************************************************/\n// Enumeration.\nvar Fruits = {\n    Apple: 0,\n    Orange: 1,\n    Watermelon: 2,\n    Banana: 3\n};

Before entering, we can all see what the magician looks like (the properties) and what tricks he (it‚Äôs mostly a ‚Äúhe‚Äù) can perform (the methods), and on what types of stuff he can make his magic tricks (type declaration). Thus from this ‚Äúpublic‚Äù poster (the header file) of the magician, I can understand what kind of magic he can perform and what props he is using. Maybe there is also a mentioning of that this particular magician has learned some of his tricks from the great Houdini (the class heritage and Houdini thus being the superclass).</p>\n\n<p>If I were allowed backstage, I would then be able to actually see how he is doing his tricks, that  is, I would be able to look in the magicians implementation file.</p>\n\n<p>Would this metaphor be somewhat along the lines of how you can understand the concept of a custom class?</p>\n\n<p>However, I have not yet quite figured out how the concept of class methods and instance methods relates to this metaphor?</p>\n\n<p>Could you say that instance methods belongs to a category of tricks that this particular ‚Äúinstance‚Äù of the magician is performing in this particular show, and the class methods would be the tricks that contemporary magicians can perform?\nThirdly, it is a bit confusing the way methods are using ‚Äútypes‚Äù. Some seem to be declared up front in the interface file, and some seem to just be ‚Äúdeclared‚Äù on the fly within the methods?</p>\n\n<p>To take an example using the ‚ÄúMagician‚Äù class, my understanding of the header file might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface Magician : NSHoudini\n\n// Instance method that given a variable of type rat it will turn this into something of type rabit \n\n-   (rabit) FromRatToRabit: (rat) aRat;\n\n@end \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the implementation file might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import ‚ÄúMagician.h‚Äù\n\n@implementation Magician\n\nrabit aRabit \n// rabit being the type and aRabit the variable\n\n\n-   (rabit) FromRatToRabit:(rat)aRat;\n{\n\n// some magic code goes here which will take what‚Äôs in the aRat variable, of type rat\n// and turn it into a form of type rabit and return it in the aRabit variable \n\naRabit\n}\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If above is correct I wonder why the aRat variable that you ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the method with is not declared? Or is the declaration considered done when you are using it in the method description?</p>\n"},{"tags":["design","design-patterns","oop"],"answer_count":13,"favorite_count":22,"up_vote_count":28,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9140,"score":28,"question_id":85272,"title":"How do you know when to use design patterns?","body":"<p>Anyone can read the GoF book to learn what design patterns are and how to use them, but what is the process for figuring out when a design pattern solves a problem?

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class customer_controller(coffee_shop_controller):\n\n    \"\"\"creates a controller to add/delete/amend customer records in the\n       coffee shop database\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def add_customer(self,fn,ln,sa,t,pc,tn):\n        sql = \"\"\"insert into customer\n                 (first_name,last_name,street_address,town,post_code,telephone_number)\n                 values\n                 ('{0}','{1}','{2}','{3}','{4}','{5}')\"\"\".format(fn,ln,sa,t,pc,tn)\n        self.cursor.execute(sql)\n        self.db.commit()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I appreciate that the design pattern may not be great (open to suggestions) and that I really should be preventing SQL injection but the closing the connection is interesting me at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>From searching around the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/sqlite3.html?highlight=sqlite3#sqlite3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python docs</a> the comment line suggests that we <strong><em>can</em></strong> close the connection, not that we <strong><em>must</em></strong>. Is this right? Do I not really need to bother?</p>\n\n<p>If I do need to bother then there seems to be a split on what I should do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manually close the connection</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/06/12/safely-using-destructors-in-python/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Use the <code>__del__</code> method</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/974813/cleaning-up-an-internal-pysqlite-connection-on-object-destruction\">Use <code>with</code> or <code>atexit</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there anything definitive here? The <code>__del__</code> method makes the most sense to me but maybe that's my ignorance talking.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.</p>\n\n<p>Adam.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","heredoc"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":12679198,"title":"using static::member->method inside HEREDOC [PHP]","body":"<pre><code>    static public function toolBar()\n{\n    var_dump(static::$_lang);\n    var_dump(static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Index'));\n    return &lt;&lt;&lt; EOC\n    &lt;a href=\"index.php\"&gt;{${static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Index')}}&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;\n    &lt;a href=\"?view=login\"&gt;{${static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Login')}}&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;     \nEOC;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Expression {${static::$_lang->getVal('Index')}} return nothing\ninstead of the string</p>\n\n<p>There is any workaround for this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":145,"score":-1,"question_id":8093220,"title":"What is the best way to start this program?","body":"<p>Write a program in Java which can do the following:\n‚ÄúHardwired‚Äù into the program:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Information about the company‚Äôs products: a product code, description, and unit price.

It involves iterating over memory addresses while encapsulating the actual implementation:</p>\n\n<p>We have an object that is a data container. It is created by allocating large chunks of memory and indexing the atomic elements in a way we've devised.</p>\n\n<p>This container is being developed as a replacement for an inefficient pointer-based object. As a result, this new object (at least in the initial stages of integration) must conform to the old interface of providing pointers or at least acting like it does.</p>\n\n<p>One specific problem I've started having doubts about is the sequential access of the elements in order. I'm attempting to turn the container into a \"black box\" to discourage the bad practices that developed as a result of the old model freely handing out modifiable raw pointers. For this reason, I've written a simple templatized \"for_each\" function that accepts a Functor that will execute on each element.</p>\n\n<p>This was all fine and dandy until I noticed some of the complex operations that were required for some functions.

I am a CS undergrad who has have been using Java for 3 years, and I still find it difficult to comprehend how to include the Main function into my design. It feels wrong to place it in a class all on its own, but it also feels wrong to insert it into another class file. I see the latter as such because it doesn't fit in with the rest of the class making it incohesive. I can't just stick a main function on my DocumentReader object, for example. It would have nothing to do with the object. On the other hand, I can't just make a Main class that only has a main function inside it because in object-oriented programming, you're supposed to think in terms of objects effectively creating a miniature world in your head. For that miniature world to revolve around a single object that does nothing but exist just seems off. It doesn't act as a narrator and character in a story because it does nothing, at the same time. I prefer C's style of having a Main function that is separate from everything. It keeps the narrative of the story separate from the characters that are interacting with one another.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know how the professionals mix the main method into the rest of their code.

It might be extremely rare that it is purely based on \"concrete object\" inheritance?  If there are such usage, what might be the situation that a Javascript purely uses \"concrete objects\" and have no \"generic objects\"?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I ask this question because Prototypal Inheritance typically is said to be \"classless\" and object-based.  But it also seems that we'd create  generic objects first, for the concrete objects to be based on, so this \"generic object\", in a way, also feel like a \"class\".  That is, even if we don't write code to make Javascript's inheritance to become a classical inheritance structure (class-based), and purely just use prototypal inheritance (object-based), we would still more often than not, use \"generic objects\" which do look like classes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: if we see a class as a \"blueprint\" of how an object is constructed, in classical OOP, then this generic object method also involves blueprints for objects, but just that it is more dynamic and not static like Objective-C.  For example, we can dynamically add a property to <code>KartDriver</code> object and now all Yoshis and Marios will inherit from it.  So looking at this blueprint design, it in fact is \"class\" and not \"classless\".  Just that this is dynamic class, while the classical OOP is static class.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":12666671,"title":"Accessing a single object from an array of objects that is in another class","body":"<p>Okay so I have a driver class called MonthlyReport that reads in data from 2 different .dat files, one has information regarding accounts and another has information regarding customers.

These files contain many functions\n\nfunction myErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline, $errcontext){\n    // some code to handle errors here\n\n}\n\nclass myObject {\n    function __construct() {\n        // set the values here\n    }\n\n    function computeSomething() {\n        ...\n        doFunction2();\n        ...\n    }\n\n    function SomethingBadHappened()\n    {\n    }\n}\n\nfunction doFunction1() {\n    // for some reason, an error happens here\n    // it is properly handled by the current error handler\n}\n\nfunction doFunction2() {\n    // for some reason, an error happens here\n    // since it got called by $obj, I want the error handler to run $obj-&gt;SomethingBadHappened();\n    // but $obj is not known in myErrorHandler function!\n}\n\nset_error_handler('myErrorHandler');\n\n// some procedural code here\ndoFunction1();\ndoAnotherThing();\n\n// then I use objects\n$obj = new myObject();\n$obj-&gt;run();\n\n// then I may use procedural code again\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My custom error handler is <strong>already</strong> working fine. It catches and processes all PHP errors that occur in the code executed after the error handler is set.</p>\n\n<h2>My problem:</h2>\n\n<p>If an error occurs within a method of <code>myObject</code> class, I would like to call a non-static method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$obj-&gt;SomethingBadHappened();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>$obj</code> is not in the scope of <code>myErrorHandler</code>. How can I access <code>$obj</code> inside the error handler to call a member function of <code>$obj</code>?<br>\nI currently have 300KB of PHP code, and I can't change the signature of all the functions to add <code>$obj</code> as a parameter (there are too many functions!).</p>\n\n<p>I read that it is possible to define the custom error handler as a method of an object. But, if I do that, it won't be able to catch errors that happen before creating the instance of <code>myObject</code> ($obj).</p>\n\n<p>I also read about exceptions, but it doesn't seem to help solving my problem.\nI am not willing to use global variables.

All classes have to share some indexing features, but also all of them define a lot of properties. The properties are defined on class level with descriptors, to be able to intercept writing to them for validation and check for duplicates in the DB. For this, every class has a list of the automatically maintained properties, <code>_properties</code>. They also hold <code>_indices</code> and some other features, which I don't want to copy on my own to every single Element-class (about 10 or so). </p>\n\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BaseElement(object):\n    _properties = None\n\nclass ElementFlavour1(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n....\n\nclass ElementFlavourN(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'e', 'f', 'g'\n\nfor item in locals():\n    if issubclass(item, BaseElement):\n        item._v_properties_set = set(item._properties) if item._properties else set()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it basically does what it should do: I need to iterate the <code>_properties</code> linearly, but I also want to do quick lookups, if some property is present in a class. Nevertheless, I don't want to repeat myself and specify this set for every single flavour of <code>BaseElement</code> explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>The current solution works, but I consider it as an ugly hack and would like to get rid of it. E.g. subclasses of <code>BaseElement</code> in other modules wouldn't get their properties set right. Playing around with <code>__new__</code> also seems to be the wrong way, as it doesn't intercept the class construction, but the instantiation. So, how to do that properly?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I'm aware of OrderedDict, but this is not what I'm looking for. I'd like to hook into the class creation process in a clean way and append arbitrary functionality there.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","oop","inheritance"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":113,"score":1,"question_id":8509421,"title":"OOP and inheritance advice needed","body":"<p>Note there's a lot of code posted below but its mostly all the same, that's what i'm looking for advice on :)</p>\n\n<p>Just getting to grips with OOP and inheritance, i'm making an android pong clone, and <strong>i'm trying to separate out a bunch of duplicate code found in my \"paddle\" and \"bomb\" classes into a separate class called sprite.

I have a library containing several objects and it is expanding quickly.  I always try to think in terms of re-useability and break my projects down into small, reusable, and loosely coupled components so that I am not only creating the project but I am also creating the parts for future projects.  I am trying to design a sort of package management system so that I can stop using the absolute paths within include statements for objects.  I would like to have a single file containing includes to every class file within my library.  Along with the includes, I want to add a class with a \"singleton\" pattern that will allow me to grab instances of every object that I have in the library on demand.  I plan to create a static getter for each object that returns a reference to a new instance.  Basically, something like this...</p>\n\n<pre><code>include('classa.php');\ninclude('classb.php');\ninclude('classc.php');\nclass pacman{\n     private static $instance_stack;\n     public static function GetPackage($strPackage){\n         if(!self::$instance_stack){\n             self::$instance_stack['classa']=new ClassA();\n             self::$instance_stack['classb']=new ClassB();\n             self::$instance_stack['classc']=new ClassC();\n         }\n         if(array_key_exists(strtolower($strPackage),self::$instance_stack)){\n             return self::$instance_stack[strtolower($strPackage)];\n         }\n         else{\n             return false;\n         }\n     }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then if I want to get class a...</p>\n\n<pre><code>include('pacman.php');\n$ClassA = pacman::GetPackage('classa');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I realize that this is a very rudimentary implementation.  My example just covers the bare minimum.  My problem isn't implementing this; rather, it is a question of whether or not hundreds of uninstantiated classes from the includes will have a noticeable effect on performance.

This sounds like a usual case for the strategy pattern. Thus I created an interface which defines the <code>render-function</code> and gave the the <code>camera</code> class a <code>pointer</code> to this interface.\nThe problem is that the <code>render function</code> needs access to all the data in the <code>camera</code> class and therefore I gave this function a pointer to the <code>camera</code> class as a parameter. It looks like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"ICameraRender.h\"\n\nclass Camera{\nprivate:\n    ICameraRender*      _cameraRender;\n\npublic:\n    Camera();\n    Camera(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n    ~Camera();\n\n    void renderCamera(){  _cameraRender-&gt;render(this); }\n\n\n    void setCameraRender(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n        /..../\n\n};\n\n\nclass ICameraRender{\npublic:\n    virtual ~ICameraRender(){\n\n    }\n\n    //Override me\n    virtual void render(Camera* camera) = 0;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to be an elegant solution due to the liability to an infity loop (calling <code>camera-&gt;renderCamera()</code> in the <code>render-function</code> in <code>ICameraRender</code>).

Since the function which operates on the camera's data, only needs access to the data I thought I could split up the camera class itself. A class called Camera and CameraModel. The last one holds all the needed data and the first one does operations on it. \nTherefore I just have to pass a pointer to CameraModel to my function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CameraModel{\nprivate:\n    /...data.../\npublic:\n   /...setter and getter.../\n};\n\nclass Camera{\nprivate: \n    CameraModel*   _cameraModel;\n    ICameraRender* _cameraRender;\n\npublic:\nCamera();\n    Camera(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n    ~Camera();\n\n    void renderCamera(){  _cameraRender-&gt;render(_cameraModel); }\n\n    void setCameraRender(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n        /..../\n};\n\nclass ICameraRender{\npublic:\n    virtual ~ICameraRender(){\n\n    }\n\n    //Override me\n    virtual void render(CameraModel* cameraModel) = 0;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the render-function (which only calculates new values for the camera according to user input) does no longer have access to the renderCamera-function.\nWhat do you think about this solution? </p>\n\n<p>Regards Stan</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","oop","nsobject"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":95,"score":-1,"question_id":12637983,"title":"how to pass values between Objective C classes(NSObject type)","body":"<p>How to pass values/objects between different NSObject classes in IOS Applications?..</p>\n\n<p>I have a class A, with following ivars- </p>\n\n<pre><code>NSString *streetAddress; \n\nNSString *city;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Class B, i want to assign values to the variables declared in Class A.</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSArray *address = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects: @\"Hosur Road\", @\"Bangalore\", nil];\n\nstreetAddress = [address objectAtIndex: 0];\n\ncity = [address objectAtIndex: 1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would create error... so how to assign in case both CLASS A &amp; B are NSObject classes.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!\n(Though this is a beginner question do answer it!)</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","oop","recursion","ember.js"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12643872,"title":"Call Recursive Method from within jQuery Ajax Function (Ember)","body":"<p>I have an object which loads data using a .getJSON jQuery method, from within this function (excerpted from the object):</p>\n\n<pre><code>getResults: function () { \n    var me = this;\n    $.getJSON(me.url, function (d) {\n        me.set(\"url\", d.pagination.next_url);\n        $.each(d.data, function (k, v) { me.results.insertAt(0, v); });\n        if (me.get(\"url\")) { me.getResults(); }\n    });\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works until the \"me.getResults()\" method is called (it definitely gets past the me.get(\"url\") call, checked that).

My thinking was that because these lower level controllers were still interacting with the view, that they should remain controllers rather than models or drivers.</p>\n\n<p>What I found, however, is that each instance of a controller also spawns a new instance of CI.  So I would have 3 or 4 instances of CI running for each request.  Ton of overhead, and also caused session issues.</p>\n\n<p>I have since moved these lower level controllers into the library as drivers.  They now capture the CI instance in the construct method, and make modifications to it.  This makes it VERY nice to work with, and doesn't require the HMVC extension.  The drivers are not externally callable either, so it allows me to funnel all requests through specific entry points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is whether this is structurally correct.</strong>  I have always held the notion that drivers should only modify the data they are provided through their method calls, but many of these drivers will pull information directly from GET and POST, and while they will not directly append to the View, they are often accessing view files, and passing the processed view to the CI instance for output.</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] <em>A little more context:</em>\nOne of the drivers I have created is essentially a user login driver called 'Access'.  It makes calls to the 'User' model for create/login/logout methods.  The driver uses the POST data to check the User model, then loads the correct view with errors and whatever is needed.  The idea, being, with 2 lines, I can include this driver in any controller throughout the project, so there is a significant decrease in code redundancy.  Again, I know that the drivers should be confined to their scope, however the driver does not modify anything outside it's scope, but simply returns the view it has created.</p>\n\n<p>Is there another method to for doing this that is more inline with straight MVC?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","class","gcc","information-hiding"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":138,"score":4,"question_id":12641358,"title":"Private functions of a class accessible?","body":"<p>I have been trying to learn C++ for some time now.

The same can be said for delete and search. </p>\n\n<pre>\n    hashTable[string1] = \"\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; hashTable[string1] &lt;&lt; endl;\n</pre>\n\n<p>My major problem is that I do not know how to overload the <code>[]</code> operator to gain this functionality.

My company recently updated their servers to 10 and we intend on leveraging the new features and functionality.</p>\n\n<p>My question is based off of something that was glossed over in the book and is leading me to confusing and conflicting answers when I throw searches at Google.  My understanding of ORM development in CF8 (using an ORM framework like Transfer, as well as book examples and other readings) places attributes for your bean in the variables.instance scope to insulate the object attributes from application attributes that are meant to exist in the variables scope.  But using the baked-in ORM in CF9 does not use the instance scope; it instead places the object and application attributes together in the variables scope.  For me, this throws of my methodology of development, since I tend to create a function in a lot of my objects that returns all object attributes at once (handy for the initialization of the object, display all of the attributes for the object, and creating a new record from an empty instance instead of manually calling all of my setters or getters individually). </p>\n\n<p>I need an explanation as to why this was done in this manner; to me it doesn't make sense.  Are there other functions that exist within the baked-in ORM that replicate my all-attributes functionality that I'm missing or haven't run into yet?  I've read that there are potential conflicts between this attribute naming process and other variables you may create in functions that aren't stemmed off by var scoping; I don't know if that stuff was resolved in 10 or if it's just nonsense.

The following is an example of a chess game that I wish to design in an OO manner. This is a very broad design and my focus at this stage is just to identify who is responsible for what messages and how the objects interact each other to simulate the game. Please point out if there are elements of bad design (high coupling, bad cohesion etc.) and how to improve on them. </p>\n\n<p>The Chess game has the following classes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Board</li>\n<li>Player</li>\n<li>Piece</li>\n<li>Square</li>\n<li>ChessGame</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Board is made up of squares and so Board can be made responsible for creating and managing Square objects. Each piece also is on a square so each piece also has a reference to the square it is on. (Does this make sense?). Each piece then is responsible to move itself from one square to another.\nPlayer class holds references to all pieces he owns and is also responsible for their creation (Should player create Pieces?) . Player has a method takeTurn which in turn calls a method movePiece which belongs to the piece Class which changes the location of the piece from its current location to another location. Now I am confused on what exactly the Board class must be responsible for. I assumed it was needed to determine the current state of the game and know when the game is over. But when a piece changes it's location how should the board get updated? should it maintain a seperate array of squares on which pieces exist and that gets updates as pieces move? </p>\n\n<p>Also, ChessGame intially creates the Board and player objects who in turn create squares and pieces respectively and start the simulation. Briefly, this might be what the code in ChessGame may look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>Player p1 =new Player();\nPlayer p2 = new Player();\n\nBoard b = new Board();\n\nwhile(b.isGameOver())\n{\n  p1.takeTurn(); // calls movePiece on the Piece object\n  p2.takeTurn();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am unclear on how the state of the board will get updated. Should piece have a reference to board? Where should be the responsibility lie? Who holds what references? Please help me with your inputs and point out problems in this design. I am deliberately not focusing on any algorithms or further details of game play as I am only interested in the design aspect.

Or is \"only providing database access, though for a number of different consumers\" a single responsibility?</p>\n\n<p>To maybe make that a bit clearer, here's roughly what the relevant classes would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DatabaseConnection\n    protected m_webservice\n    public OftenUsedDatabaseAccess()\n\nApplicationDatabaseConnection : DatabaseConnection, IConnectorA, IConnectorB\n    public IConnectorA.RetrieveRecords(fieldValue)\n    public IConnectorB.WriteStuff(listOfStuff)\n\nFunctionAController\n    private m_IConnectorA\n\nFunctionBController\n    private m_IConnectorB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The alternatives I can think of don't really seem ideal to me either.</p>\n\n<p>To split up the database access functionality, the <code>ApplicationDatabaseConnection</code> class could only be a factory class with <code>Create</code> methods for the different connectors (behind <code>IConnectorAFactory</code>, <code>IConnectorBFactory</code> interfaces) - but there's not really anything there to necessitate a factory pattern; there's nothing I only know when instantiating the \"controller\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the actual connector classes would essentially also need to be derivations of <code>DatabaseConnection</code> because they need the same basic abilities, and then (at the latest) the whole construct becomes rather ominous.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose I have taken a wrong turn at some point in my thinking and am now completely on the wrong track. What should the structure of such a solution look like? Any push in the right direction will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>@Tobias ' answer made me realize that I forgot an important detail: There are two different versions of the web service with pretty much the same abilities, but completely different APIs, which is one reason why it <em>has</em> to be encapsulated.</p>\n\n<p>Another one is that if my logic classes access the web service directly (or via an interface), they are also concerned with constructing the web service queries in all their detail, which makes for much more tightly coupled code (the kind we've been producing so far) and violates SRP - hence the connector interface idea.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","oop","android-fragments","android-view"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":2,"question_id":12554783,"title":"How can I use Fragments without violating core OO principles?","body":"<p>The documented Android fragment samples (<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/fragment-ui.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FragmentBasics</a>, <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/adaptui.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NewsReader</a> violate core principles of object oriented design.

Please see","body":"<p>I am curious as to how the concept of \"inheritance\" takes place in the world of object oriented programming. Let me explain my dilemma (I came across this dilemma while studying Java but I hope that my question is generic in nature) :</p>\n\n<p>Suppose there is a class A and a class B. Class A <strong>\"inherits\"</strong> Class B. What does this actually mean? Does the compiler make a <strong>\"new\"</strong> class, which is <em>THEN</em> instantiated into an object which contains the elements of both the classes A and B behind the scenes? If that's the case, then how are the access restrictions implemented according to the access specifiers?</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, I wondered if it happens in the following manner :</p>\n\n<p>An object of class A is created and then an object of class B is created. Java then somehow \"link\" the members of A to the members of B and make it appear as if they belonged to the same class and it does that according to the access specifiers. </p>\n\n<p>But then, it occurred to me that there is a fault with this theory. Suppose two different classes, B and C are inheriting class A. Then, if we are going to make objects of class B and class C, then they'll have their OWN copies of the elements of class A. So this theory fails too.</p>\n\n<p>I was just trying to explain the confusion about inheritance that I have in my mind. It's giving me headache.

Below's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class MyMovieClip extends MovieClip {\n\n        private var _isEnabled:Boolean = false;\n\n        public function MyMovieClip():void {\n\n            trace(this);\n        }\n\n        public function set isEnabled( b:Boolean ):void {\n\n            _isEnabled = b;\n        }\n\n        public function get isEnabled():Boolean {\n\n            return _isEnabled;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then I have another class where I am adding instances of the movieclip to the stage in a loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class MyOtherClass extends MovieClip {\n\n        public var myMC:MyMovieClip;\n        public var docClass:*;\n\n        public function MyOtherClass( docRef:* ):void { // passing in a reference to the DocumentClass so I can access the stage\n            docClass = docRef;\n            init();\n        }\n\n        public function init():void {\n\n            for(var i:int=0; i&lt;6; i++) {\n\n                var myMC:MyMovieClip = new MyMovieClip; // instantiate the movieclip which is exported for actionscript and has a custom class \n                //set a few native properties\n                myMC.name = \"myMC\" + i; //setting the name so I can reference this movieclip after it's been added to stage\n                myMC.y = myMC.height * i + 20;\n                myMC.x = 20;\n                myMC.alpha = .7;\n            }\n\n            dispatchEvent(new Event(MyOtherClass.MOVIECLIPS_ADDED)); // just to be safe, let's dispatch a custom event when all movieclips have been added\n        }\n\n        public function traceEnabled():void {\n\n            trace(docClass.stage.getChildByName(\"myMC1\").isEnabled); // this throws: 1119: Access of possibly undefined property isEnabled through a reference with static type flash.display:DisplayObject\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally I instantiate MyOtherClass inside my document class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class DocumentClass extends MovieClip {\n\n        public var myOtherClass:MyOtherClass;\n\n        public function DocumentClass():void {\n\n            addEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, onAddedToStage);\n        }\n\n        public function onAddedToStage(e:Event):void {\n\n            myOtherClass = new MyOtherClass(); // upon instantiation, init is called in MyOtherClass and all of my movieclips are added to the sage\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What gives? Why can't I access the MyMovieClip property, isEnabled, after it's been added to the stage? Is there another way?

Create a Claws class and contain that within the\n  Cats class.

Usually I learn a lot by studying the class design of professional, commercial-grade frameworks, but I have to say that something doesn't quite smell right here.</p>\n\n<p>System.IO.Stream is an abstract class representing a sequence of bytes. It has 10 abstract method/properties: <code>Read, Write, Flush, Length, SetLength, Seek, Position, CanRead, CanWrite, CanSeek</code>. So many abstract members makes it cumbersome to derive from, because you have to override all those methods, even if most end up just throwing <code>NotImplemented</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Users of Stream classes are expected to call <code>CanRead</code>, <code>CanWrite</code>, or <code>CanSeek</code> to find out the capabilities of the Stream, or I suppose just go ahead and call <code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code>, or <code>Seek</code> and see if it throws <code>NotImplemented</code>. Is it just me, or is this crummy design?</p>\n\n<p>Though there are many nits I'd like to pick with the <code>Stream</code> class design, the main one I'd like to ask about is this: Why didn't they use interfaces, like <code>IReadable</code>, <code>IWriteable</code>, <code>ISeekable</code>, instead? Then a new Stream class could gracefully derive from the interfaces it supports. Isn't this the object-oriented way of doing things? Or am I missing something? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: It was pointed out that the value <code>CanRead</code> <em>et al</em> can change at runtime&mdash;for example if a <code>FileStream</code> is closed&mdash;and the point is taken. However, I remain unconvinced that this is a good design. From where I'm from, trying to read from a file that's already been closed is a bug, or at least an exceptional condition. (And thus throwing an exception is a natural way to handle this situation.)</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that every time I'm about to <code>Read</code> from a <code>Stream</code>, I should check <code>CanRead</code>? And would that mean I should put a lock in place to avoid a race condition, if it's possible for the value to change sometime in between the <code>CanRead</code> call and the <code>Read</code> call?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update Aug 7 2010</strong>: The consensus here seems to be the Stream design is pretty good as it stands.

Each Player has their own Health-bar and they can all ‚Äòhit‚Äô each other to make it go down 10 points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Players_DLL</strong>\nThis one is used by both Server (not mentioned from here on) and Client. It houses the CPlayer class (stores ID and max hp and current hp), and also the CPlayerS (static) class which will manage the players using a collection. <code>CPlayer</code> exposes <code>Action&lt;double&gt; hp_cur_changed;</code> and   <code>CPlayerS</code> exposes <code>Action&lt;CPlayer&gt; Action_Update_Player;</code> You can guess what these do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client_DLL</strong></p>\n\n<p>Uses Players_DLL and TCP/UDP sockets to actually make the game work.</p>\n\n<p>-When Client_DLL receives it‚Äôs own playerID from the server, it will execute <code>Players_dll.CPlayers.getByID(id).hp_cur_changed = Events.CEvents.Action_Me_HP_Updated;</code></p>\n\n<p>-When Client_DLL starts it will bind <code>Players_dll.CPlayers.Action_Update_Player</code> to a function called <code>player_updated(Players_dll.CPlayer player)</code> which will in turn fire <code>Events.CEvents.Action_Player_Updated(player.id, player.hp_cur, player.hp_max);</code></p>\n\n<p>So as you can see, this in turn exposes <code>public static Action&lt;double&gt; Action_Me_HP_Updated;</code> and <code>public static Action&lt;int, double, double&gt; Action_Player_Updated;</code> so that <code>Client_GFX</code> can easily update it‚Äôs UI/Graphics when required. </p>\n\n<p><code>Client_DLL</code> of course also exposes functions such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Client_DLL.Network.Players.AddPlayer.nw_addPlayer()\nClient_DLL.Network.Players.HitPlayer.nw_hitPlayer(int playerID)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <strong>Client_GFX</strong> can actually control the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client_GFX</strong></p>\n\n<p>Client_GFX will now have to call</p>\n\n<p><code>Client_DLL.Global.CStart.Start();</code></p>\n\n<p>so <code>Client_DLL</code> can do it‚Äôs start-up things,\nand then bind Methods to it‚Äôs Actions, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Client_DLL.Global.CStart.Start();\nClient_DLL.Events.CEvents.Action_Player_Updated = BindDllEvents.Players.PlayerBinds.playerUpdated;\nClient_DLL.Events.CEvents.Action_Me_HP_Updated = BindDllEvents.Players.PlayerBinds.meUpdated;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These methods essentialy make it so that when another player‚Äôs HP changes,\nthis code is called:</p>\n\n<p><code>Graphical.UI.Forms.Form1.frm.DrawPlayer(id, hp_cur, hp_max);</code></p>\n\n<p>Or if our own HP changes:</p>\n\n<p><code>Graphical.UI.Forms.Form1.frm.DrawMe((int)hp_cur);</code></p>\n\n<p>These Form1 methods simply draw our own healthbar, or another player‚Äôs<br>\nhealthbar + a button so we can tell the server we want that player‚Äôs health\npoints to go down. We‚Äôll keep track of which playerID‚Äôs we already created a\nhealth-bar for, and update rather than add if it already exists.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","oop","static","scope"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":92,"score":0,"question_id":12493332,"title":"What is the point of a non-static method in a static class?","body":"<p>I took a look over <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179808/what-is-the-point-to-a-static-method-in-a-non-static-class\">this</a> question and I was wondering the opposite situation.

A third class, Host, represents a single application on a single server, including references to the Application and Server objects as well as additional data such as the amount of disk space used by the application on the server. Both Server and Application objects contain a list of all their hosts: hence, Applications know about Hosts and Hosts know about Applications, and Servers know about Hosts and Hosts know about Servers.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of my project is to work out the schedule for migrating a bunch of applications onto new servers. Originally each application had a migration-start and migration-end date. Some applications also have start and end dates for virtualisation. Virtualisation occurs if the migration cannot be performed within the application's constraints (never mind what these are). It occurs prior to the migration and frees the application from its constraints. An object called 'Schedule' is held by the Application object, which includes these 4 dates as well as a boolean flag to say whether it is to be virtualised, and a list of 'months' which contain the man-hours required to migrate (or virtualise) the application in each particular month.</p>\n\n<p>We now want to allow servers to undergo virtualisation separately, on a specified date. All the applications (or parts of applications, i.e. hosts) on these servers will be virtualised on this date; they will be migrated along with the rest of the application. We originally decided to have the server class hold its own Schedule object. The virtualisation dates were then set in the server. However, we decided we wanted to keep the server and application schedules consistent - so that, for example, the server schedule's migration-start and end dates should be set to the earliest start and latest end dates, respectively, of all applications running on that server. This meant that every time we updated the Application dates, we had to remember to update all its server dates (via the host object). Or, if we wanted to update the Application's man-hours for a particular month, we had to update the server's man-hours also.</p>\n\n<p>Then we thought about putting a single Schedule object inside each Host object. This solves the consistency problem, but leads to quite a bit of redundancy: since all Host objects belonging to an application will necessarily have the same migration dates (but possibly different virtualisation dates), when you set the migration dates for an app, you have to set the same dates for every host. Also, there are a few instances where we need to work out the earliest-start and latest-finish dates for servers AND applications, as above. This would involve either: holding this data in each of the application and server objects (effectively giving each its own Schedule, thereby brining back problems with consistency), or: calculating this data on-the-fly each time it is needed, by looping through all the hosts' schedules. The same goes for the man-hours required by an application each month, which is calculated at the application level, fractioned into hours for each host per month, and then recalculated when we need to figure it out at the application level again. This is, as you would expect, not efficient in the slightest.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a straightforward question, but I'm wondering if there are any accepted strategies for dealing with this sort of situation. Sorry in advance for the prolixity of my post; hopefully I've made the situation clear enough.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","oop","class"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":873,"score":5,"question_id":1142548,"title":"Does Delphi's static keyword have any point in native-only code?","body":"<p>My understanding is that the <code>static</code> keyword was introduced for compatibility with .NET (along with <code>strict</code>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>class TExample\n  class procedure First;\n  class procedure Second; static;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The differences between procedures <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> are :-</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>First</code> can be overridden in a descendant class</li>\n<li><code>First</code> passes an implicit self parameter referencing the <code>TExample</code> class.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Class procedure <code>Second</code> cannot be overridden and passes no parameters and is thus .NET compatible.

(OOP)","body":"<p>I'm a 1st level C# programming student, though I've been dabbling in programming for a few years, and learning above and beyond what the class teaches me is just what I'm doing so that I'm thoroughly prepared once I get out into the job environment. This particular class isn't OOP at all, that's actually the next class, but for this project the teacher said he wouldn't mind if we went above and beyond and did the project in OOP (in fact you can't get an A in his class unless you go above and beyond anyways).</p>\n\n<p>The project is(at this point) to read in an XML file, byte by byte, store element tags to one array, and the data values to another. I fought with him on this(given the .net frameworks dealing on XML) but that was a loosing battle. He wants us to code this without using .net XML stuff.</p>\n\n<p>He did provide an example of OOP for this program that he slopped together (originally written in Java, ported to C++, then ported from C++ to C#)</p>\n\n<p>In his example he's got three classes. the first, <code>XMLObject</code>, which contains the arrays, a quasi constructor, getter and setter methods(not properties, which I plan to fix in my version), and a method for adding the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> to tags to be stored in the arrays (and output to console if need be.)</p>\n\n<p>The second class is a <code>parseXML</code> class. In this one he has fields that keep track of the line count, file offset, tag offset, and strings to hold elements and data.\nAgain, he's got getter and setter methods, several parse methods that search for different things, and a general parse method that uses the other parse methods(sort of combines them here). Some of these methods make calls to the XMLObject class's methods, and send the parsed element and data values to their respective arrays.</p>\n\n<p>The third class he has is one that has no fields, and has two methods, one for doing ATOI and one for dumping a portion of the file stream to the console.</p>\n\n<p>I know we're essentially building a less efficient version of what's already included in the .net framework. I've pointed this out to him and was told \"do not use .net's XML class, end of discussion\" so let's all agree to just leave that one alone.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, should those really be 3 separate classes. Shouldn't the parsing class either inherit from the XML object class, or just be coded in the XML object class, and shouldn't the ATOI and dumping methods be in one of those two classes as well?</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to me that if the parsing class's aim in life is to parse an XML file and store elements and data fields to an array, it should be in the same class rather than being isolated and having to do it through getters and setters(or properties in the version I'm going to do). I don't see why the arrays would need to be encapsulated away from the parse methods that actually give them what to store.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated, as I'm still designing this, and want to do it at least as close to \"proper\"(I know it's a relative term) OOP form.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","oop","vector","arraylist"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":0,"question_id":12441539,"title":"JAva Vector Print","body":"<p>I have a class Bank </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Bank {\n    public static final double INTEREST = 0.1;  //Interest rate charged on overdrawn accounts\n    private Vector customers=new Vector();\n    private Address address;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        //address = null;\n    }\n\n    public Bank(Address add) {\n        customers = new Vector ();\n        address = add;\n    }\n\n    // add a Customer to the customers Vector\n    public void addCustomer(Customer cus) {\n        customers.add(cus);\n    }\n\n    // get and set methods\n    public Vector getCustomers() {\n        return customers;\n    }\n\n    public void setCustomers(Vector v) {\n        customers = v;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>now i am adding customers to the Banks class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){\n    int custnum=b.getBank().getCustomers().size()+1;\n    ad=new Address(txtCustStreet.getText(),txtCustCity.getText(),txtCustPostCode.getText());\n    cus=new Customer(txtCustName.getText(),ad,custnum, Integer.parseInt(txtoverdraft.getText()));\n\n    if (e.getSource() == jbExit) {\n        frame.dispose();\n    }\n    if (e.getSource() == jbSubmit) {\n        // b.getBank().setCustomers(null);\n        b.getBank().addCustomer(cus);\n    }\n    System.out.println(b.getBank().getCustomers().size());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when i am printing the vector size after adding 1 customers it prints 1\nwhen i add two customers it prints like\n1\n2\nwhile i add 3 customers it prints like \n1\n2\n3</p>\n\n<p>i want only only to print 3 when i add 3 customers not \n1\n2\n3\nplease help me out thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","javascript","oop","mvc","codeigniter"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":521,"score":2,"question_id":5398852,"title":"PHP MVC with pure Javascript View : good practice?","body":"<p>My question might not be understandable enough, so let me explain the situation :</p>\n\n<p>I'm working on a big ajax webApp built, server side, with PHP using CodeIgniter.

If you think about it, it's a weird type of function, it's a member of the object but it cannot access any other private variables, which means it doesn't contribute to encapsulation. It's almost like an independent helper method for the object.</p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering, why did Douglas Crockford come up with these confusing terms? And why have the javascript community adopted these terminologies?

Also, I am confused when to extend an interface with another interface. Sorry about the long post, but this is very confusing.</p>\n\n<p>Creating shapes seems like a popular starting point. Let's say we want a way to model 2D shapes. We know that each shape will have an area. What would be the difference between the following two implementations:</p>\n\n<p>with interfaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Shape {\n    public double area();\n}\n\npublic class Square implements Shape{\n    private int length = 5;\n    public Square(){...}\n\n    public double area()\n         return length * length;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with abstract class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class Shape {\n    abstract public double area();\n}\n\npublic class Square extends Shape {\n    private length = 5;\n    public Square(){...}\n\n    public double area(){\n        return length * length;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I understand that abstract classes allows you to define instance variables and allows you to give method implementations whereas an interface cannot do these things. But in this case, it seems like these two implementations are identical. So using any one is fine? </p>\n\n<p>But now say we want to describe different types of triangles. We can have an isosceles, acute, and right angle triangles. To me, it makes sense to use class inheritance in this case. Using the 'IS-A' definition: a Right Triangle \"IS-A\" Triangle. A Triangle \"IS-A\" Shape. Also, an abstract class should define behaviors and attributes that are common within all subclasses, so this is perfect: </p>\n\n<p>with abstract class</p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract Triangle extends Shape {\n    private final int sides = 3;\n}\nclass RightTriangle extends Triangle {\n    private int base = 4;\n    private int height = 5;\n\n    public RightTriangle(){...}\n\n    public double area() {\n        return .5 * base * height\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can do this with interfaces as well, with Triangle and Shape being interfaces. However, unlike class inheritance (using 'IS-A' relationship to define what should be a subclass), I'm not sure how to use an interface. I see two ways:</p>\n\n<p>First way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public interface Triangle {\n      public final int sides = 3;\n  }\n  public class RightTriangle implements Triangle, Shape {\n      private int base = 4;\n      private int height = 5;\n\n      public RightTriangle(){}\n      public double area(){\n          return .5 * height * base;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Second way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Triangle extends Shape {\n     public final int sides = 3;\n} \npublic class RightTriangle implements Triangle {\n    ....\n\n    public double area(){\n         return .5 * height * base;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It seems to me like both of these ways work. But when would you use one way over the other? And are there any advantages to using interfaces over abstract classes to represent different triangles? Even though we complicated the description of a shape, using interface vs abstract class still seem equivalent. </p>\n\n<p>A critical component to interfaces is that it can define behaviors that can be shared across  unrelated classes. So an interface Flyable would be present in classes Airplane as well as in Bird. So in this case, it is clear that an interface approach is preferred. </p>\n\n<p>Also, to build off of the confusing interface extending another interface:\nWhen should the 'IS-A' relationship be ignored when deciding on what should be an interface?\nTake this example: <a href=\"http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Language-Basics/Extendinganinterfacewithinheritance.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">LINK</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Why should 'VeryBadVampire' be a class and 'Vampire' be an interface? A 'VeryBadVampire' IS-A 'Vampire', so my understanding is that a 'Vampire' should be a superclass (maybe abstract class). A 'Vampire' class can implement 'Lethal' to keep its lethal behavior. Furthermore, a 'Vampire' IS-A 'Monster', so 'Monster' should be a class as well. A 'Vampire' class can also implement an interface called 'Dangerous' to keep its dangerous behavior. If we wish to create a new monster called 'BigRat' which is dangerous but not lethal, then we can create a 'BigRat' class which extends 'Monster' and implements 'Dangerous'. </p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't the above achieve the same output as using 'Vampire' as an interface (described in the link)? The only difference I see is that using class inheritance and preserving the 'IS-A' relationship clears up a lot of confusion. Yet this is not followed. What is the advantage of doing this? </p>\n\n<p>Even if you wanted a monster to share vampiric behavior, one can always redefine how the objects are represented. If we wanted a new type of vampire monster called 'VeryMildVampire' and we wanted to create a vampire-like monster called 'Chupacabra', we can do this:</p>\n\n<p>'Vampire' class extends 'Monster' implements 'Dangerous', 'Lethal', 'BloodSuckable'<br/>\n'VeryMildVampire' class extends 'Vampire' class <br/>\n'Chupacabra' class extends 'Monster' implements 'BloodSuckable'<br/></p>\n\n<p>But we can also do this:</p>\n\n<p>'VeryMildVampire' extends 'Monster' implements Dangerous, Lethal, Vampiric<br/>\n'Chupacabra' extends 'Monster' implements Dangerous, Vampiric</p>\n\n<p>The second way here creates a 'Vampiric' interface so that we can more easily define a related monster rather than create a bunch of interfaces which define vampiric behaviors (like in the first example). But this breaks the IS-A relationship. So I'm confused...</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","oop","class","generics"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":3,"question_id":12410890,"title":"Type constraint","body":"<p>I have the following class hierarchy. </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Header { IEnumerable&lt;Item&gt; Item { get; set; } .... }\nclass HeaderA : Header { .... } // Item should have the type of IEnumerable&lt;ItemA&gt;\nclass HeaderB : Header { .... } // Item should have the type of IEnumerable&lt;ItemB&gt;\n\nclass Item { .... }\nclass ItemA : Item { .... }\nclass ItemB : Item { .... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it possible to have compile time checking on the type of <code>Item</code> to make sure it's <code>IEnumerable&lt;ItemA&gt;</code>, <code>IEnumerable&lt;ItemB&gt;</code> for <code>ItemA</code> and <code>ItemB</code> respectively?

In fact we maintain patches against specific versions of several packages that are applied automatically on each new build. The main argument is that this is the right thing to do, as opposed to an \"ugly\" workaround or a fragile monkey patch.

Any help here is greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>\n\n<pre><code>class User(object):\n\n    #Input a UI row number and this will generate a corresponding row of widgets\n    def generateLine(self, rowNumber):\n        self.NameVar = StringVar()\n        self.ReasonVar = StringVar()\n        #ExcusedVar\n\n        self.Name_Cbox = ec.AutocompleteCombobox(content, textvariable = self.NameVar)\n        self.Name_Cbox.grid(row = rowNumber, column = 0)\n\n        self.Reason_Cbox = ec.AutocompleteCombobox(content, textvariable = self.ReasonVar)\n        self.Reason_Cbox.grid(row = rowNumber, column = 1)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["oop","architecture","domain-driven-design","separation-of-concerns","object-oriented-analysis"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":119,"score":0,"question_id":12322736,"title":"Domain driven design concepts","body":"<p>I'm having some trouble with a few concepts in an application I am building using domain driven design.  </p>\n\n<p>I have the following layers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Application</li>\n<li>Domain</li>\n<li>Infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, let's assume I have the following classes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Order</code></li>\n<li><code>EmailService</code></li>\n<li><code>OrderNotificationService</code></li>\n<li><code>OrderApplicationService</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously, the <code>Order</code> goes in the domain layer and the <code>OrderApplicationService</code> goes in the application layer.

Right now I'm working on a project with multiple states, and it's my first attempt at a bigger programming task/challenge. Right now I'm trying to work on a simple menu state class, but I'm not sure how to go about designing it to do what I want.

For example, if the menu has 3 items, I want the user to be able to press up and down to switch the currently selected element, and if the user is on the last element (#3) and presses down again, they wrap back around to element #1. (and vice versa..)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I ~think~ that this will require me to make a new class called 'MenuElement', and a class called 'MenuState' which contains and allows the user to switch between and select a specific element.</p>\n\n<p>As a new, self-taught C++ programmer, I have limited experience with some of the more advanced containers and I'm much more familiar with simple c-style arrays. I have a little bit of experience with vectors, and I know a little bit about linked lists, maps, and trees, but I'm not sure which container type to use for this situation. I've seen examples of using pointers to create a circular linked list before, but the example was in C and it seemed a little bit clumsy. <strong><em>Is there a specific type of contain that bests fits my problem? Or am I over-thinking it, and I should just pick one and run with it?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I think I could eventually get this system up and running using an array of MenuElements with a series of conditional statements.

The only thing that comes to mind is passing a Log <em>type</em> to the Logger constructor, and changing my Logger class to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Logger\n{\n    private $writer;\n    private $log_type;\n    public function __construct(LogWriter $writer, $log_type)\n    {\n        $this-&gt;writer = $writer;\n        $this-&gt;log_type = $log_type;\n    }\n    public function write($message)\n    {\n        $log = new $this-&gt;log_type();\n        $log-&gt;setMessage($message);\n        $this-&gt;writer-&gt;write($log);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then creating a new Logger instance like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$log_writer = new LogWriter();\n$logger = new Logger($log_writer, \"Log\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that feels a bit hackish. So how do you deal with micro-dependencies like this?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I'm using the logging classes as an example, and I'm not looking for a solution to this exact problem. I would probably just use an array instead of the Log class.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: In a more complex situation, I might pass a dependency injection container to the Logger class, and use that to create an instance of Log, but that seems overly complicated for a simple logger class.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":99,"score":3,"question_id":7441519,"title":"should I call the [super superMethod] after my own code or before it?","body":"<p>[sorry for my weak english]</p>\n\n<p>The question is simple (but i have troubles in expresing it and found it in google )</p>\n\n<p>Should I (in all similiar cases, when i override the super method, not only this \none) use</p>\n\n<p><code>- (void)viewDidLoad</code>\n{</p>\n\n<pre><code> /*\n      my code\n */\n[super viewDidLoad];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<p><code>- (void)viewDidLoad</code>\n{</p>\n\n<pre><code>[super viewDidLoad];\n\n /*\n      my code\n */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n\n<p>or it depends?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","oop","math","web-applications"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":2,"question_id":12344818,"title":"Need help making sql data usable for math functions php","body":"<p>Okay, I'm trying to get data from multiple rows by user_id, then instantiate those values as separate arrays to my \"Checks\" class..

The project that I've been working on to teach myself is a C++ game that has multiple classes, files, states, etc. However, I keep running into snags with file organization that range from simply struggling with where to create objects to compile-breaking linker errors.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of some of the errors that I've been getting:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1&gt;SMGA.obj : error LNK2005: \"class Engine smgaEngine\" (?smgaEngine@@3VEngine@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;SplashScreenState.obj : error LNK2005: \"class Engine smgaEngine\" (?smgaEngine@@3VEngine@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;StateManager.obj : error LNK2005: \"class StateManager gameStateManager\" (?gameStateManager@@3VStateManager@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;MSVCRTD.lib(cinitexe.obj) : warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've looked around online and I've seen a lot of ~similar~ problems that involve bad include guards or the inclusion of .cpp files instead of .h files.

Could this be the issue? - They're still within the include guards, and I wasn't too sure about where else to put them in my code...

It seems that every time I attempt to make clean code with encapsulated classes, I end up with a confusing mess. I'm trying to prevent a high degree of class coupling, but I often end up with either linker errors or a lack of ability to communicate between classes... Is it creation of class instance objects within the header files that is causing these errors or is it something else?

The problem I have encountered is that the DAL type must be understood on multiple levels of the BOL inheritance, for example, a base business object must be able to access base DAL object properties, however the same property must provide the specific instance later.</p>\n\n<p>Since C# doesn't support return covariance, I'm not able to simply use a more specific type in an override declaration.  I'm also not able to use generics as I would have to do a concrete specification of the type to make use of it and that breaks further inheritance for the same return covariance reason.  The only solution I've been able to come up with so far seems very scary so I wanted to post it here for feedback or alternate ideas.</p>\n\n<p>It seems this can be dealt with by defining a generic interface <code>IHasDal&lt;TDalType&gt;</code>.  I can then specify that the <code>BOLBase : IHasDal&lt;BaseDAL&gt;</code>.  This then requires an implementation of the .Dal property on BOLBase.  For BolChild, it is declared as <code>BOLChild : BOLBase, IHasDal&lt;ChildDAL&gt;</code> and then specifies a <code>.Dal</code> property that is of type <code>ChildDAL</code>.  While these two commands are unrelated and specific to the level of the class they reside within, I linked them by having a private field in <code>BOLBase</code> of type <code>BaseDAL</code>.  I can then cast it via AS for each child property implementation.</p>\n\n<p>In theory it seems like this should give me what I'm looking for with minimal issues.  It will be available for either an object implementing an <code>IHasDal</code> of whatever type I specify or for any given <code>BOLBase</code> derived class.

The base class knows the event has occurred; the derived class knows what to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>I now want to combine the features provided by these base classes in a higher-level class, so for example when a message arrives from another process, my new class can then forward it on over its network connection using a similar event-driven networking class.  It looks like I have two options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(1) composition: derive classes from each of the event-handling base classes and add objects of those derived classes to my new class as members, or:</p></li>\n<li><p>(2) multiple inheritance: make my new class a derived class of all of the event-handling base classes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've tried both (1) and (2), and I'm not satisfied with my implementation of either.  </p>\n\n<p>There's an extra complication: some of the base classes have been written using initialisation and shutdown methods instead of using constructors and destructors, and of course these methods have the same names in each class.  So multiple inheritance causes function name ambiguity.  Solvable with <code>using</code> declarations and/or explicit scoping, but not the most maintainable-looking thing I've ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Even without that problem, using multiple inheritance and overriding every pure virtual function from each of several base classes is going to make my new class very big, bordering on \"God Object\"-ness.  As requirements change (read: \"as requirements are added\") this isn't going to scale well.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, using separate derived classes and adding them as members of my new class means I have to write lots of methods on each derived class to exchange information between them.  This feels very much like \"getters and setters\" - not quite as bad, but there's a lot of \"get this information from that class and hand it to this one\", which has an inefficient feel to it - lots of extra methods, lots of extra reads and writes, and the classes have to know a lot about each other's logic, which feels wrong.  I think a full-blown publish-and-subscribe model would be overkill, but I haven't yet found a simple alternative.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a lot of duplication of data if I use composition.  For example, if my class's state depends on whether its network connection is up and running, I have to either have a state flag in every class affected by this, or have every class query the networking class for its state every time a decision needs to be made.  If I had just one multiply-inherited class, I could just use a flag which any code in my class could access.  </p>\n\n<p>So, multiple inheritance, composition, or perhaps something else entirely?  Is there a general rule-of-thumb on how best to approach this kind of thing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","oop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":11330309,"title":"updating property method by variables","body":"<p>I wanna to change object's property via method called this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MAP = MAP || {\n   level: 0\n   updateProperty(property, value){\n        if (this.hasOwnProperty(property){\n          this.property = value\n        }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but when I fire this code I create new property named 'property' in my object.

I mean, considering the way desktop applications use events and the way state-less applications use events (as plugi-ns): The first use events for the whole application, including views, the last just for server-side operations.</p>\n\n<p>One is more related to Aspect-oriented programming (with signals and slots) and the other is not specifically tied to <strong>cross-cutting concerns</strong>/AOP.

When new vehicles arrive at Holiday Travel Vehicles, a new\n  vehicle record is created.

If the\n  customer requests dealer-¬≠‚Äêinstalled options, they are listed on the\n  invoice as well. The invoice also summarizes the negotiated price,\n  plus any applicable taxes and license fees.

However since vehicles get records upon arrival to the dealership, I also thought about making vehicle it's own class with the subclass travel trailer and RV since one involves an engine and one does not.  However if I am doing vehicle records and vehicle information in an invoice I can't make vehicle both it's own class and a subclass of invoice.(If everything I am saying does not make sense, I am sorry I am just really confused.)

I am storing command-line arguments to an instance of this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Arguments\n{\n   public string ConnectionString { get; set; }\n   public int ProductId { get; set; }\n   public string ProductName { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At some point, I need to fetch the product from the database. I am using the following repository for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IProductRepository\n{\n   Product GetById(int productId, string connectionString);\n   Product GetByName(string productName, string connectionString);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I inject an implementation of the repository to the class that uses it, e.g:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProductProcessor\n{\n   private readonly IProductRepository productRepository;\n\n   public ProductProcessor(IProductRepository productRepository)\n   {\n      this.productRepository = productRepository;\n   }\n\n   public void Process(Arguments arguments)\n   {\n      Product productToProcess;\n\n      if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(arguments.ProductName))\n      {\n         productToProcess = productRepository.GetByName(arguments.ProductName, arguments.ConnectionString);\n      }\n      else\n      {\n         productToProcess = productRepository.GetById(arguments.ProductId, arguments.ConnectionString);\n      }\n\n      // ....\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is working, but what I don't like about the design is that every method of the <code>IProductRepository</code> has a <code>connectionString</code> argument. If there was no dependency injection involved, I would probably rewrite it like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void Process(Arguments arguments)\n{\n   Product productToProcess;\n\n   ProductRepository productRepository = new ProductRepository(arguments.ConnectionString);\n\n   if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(arguments.ProductName))\n   {\n      productToProcess = productRepository.GetByName(arguments.ProductName);\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      productToProcess = productRepository.GetById(arguments.ProductId);\n   }\n\n   // ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This enables me to have simpler and easier-to-use interface. Of course, now the <code>ProductRepository</code> does not have parameterless constructor and it is difficult to use with DI container. Ideally, I would like to have the best of both worlds, i.e. to initialize the <code>ProductRepository</code> with the connection string from constructor and remove the connection string from its methods. <strong>What is the best approach to achieve this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some approaches I've already considered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add a method <code>Initialize(string connectionString)</code> to the <code>IProductRepository</code> that would basically serve as a constructor. Obvious drawback is that I now need to check whether the <code>Initialize</code> has been called before doing anything in <code>GetById</code> or <code>GetByName</code> methods.</li>\n<li>Do not use constructor injection and use Service Locator pattern instead to instantiate <code>ProductRepository</code>. I don't like Service Locator much, but this is probably only possible solution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any better alternative?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From the answers I see that I should have posted a bit more context. I am using Ninject as my DI container. In <code>Main</code> method in my Program.cs, I register all dependencies to the container and instantiate the class that serves as an entry-point to the application:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    StandardKernel kernel = new StandardKernel();\n    kernel.Bind&lt;IArgumentsParser&gt;().To&lt;IArgumentsParser&gt;();\n    kernel.Bind&lt;IProductProcessor&gt;().To&lt;ProductProcessor&gt;();\n    kernel.Bind&lt;IProductRepository&gt;().To&lt;ProductRepository&gt;();\n\n    MainClass mainClass = kernel.Get&lt;MainClass&gt;();\n    mainClass.Start(args);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>MainClass</code> looks like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainClass\n{\n    private readonly IArgumentsParser argumentsParser;\n    private readonly IProductProcessor productProcessor;        \n\n    public MainClass(IArgumentsParser parser, IProductProcessor processor)\n    {\n        argumentsParser = parser;\n        productProcessor = processor;\n    }\n\n    public void Start(string[] args)\n    {\n        Arguments parsedArguments = argumentsParser.Parse(args);\n        productProcessor.Process(parsedArguments );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This enables me to have a dependency to Ninject and creation of the whole graph in one place only (the <code>Main</code> method) and the rest of the application knows nothing about DI and containers.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to keep it that way, if possible.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","design","architecture"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":155,"score":0,"question_id":12250029,"title":"How to design OO graph node classes with improved usability & readability?","body":"<p>This is a basic OO design question. I'm writing classes in C++ to represent items in a flow chart according to an input C file that have been parsed.</p>\n\n<p>Simply we have 2 types of items (classes) : <strong>FlowChartActionItem</strong> and <strong>FlowChartConditionItem</strong>. \nThese represent Actions and Decision/Condition elements of a flowchart respectively. And they also represent Statements and If-conditions respectively, that existed in the input C file. Both classes inherit <strong>FlowChartItem</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Each sub-classes has a number of pointers to the items that comes after them; yes, we have a graph, with nodes(items) and links(pointers). But the <strong>FlowChartActionItem</strong> has only one outward pointer while the <strong>FlowChartConditionItem</strong> has 3 outward pointers (for the then-statements branch, the else-statements branch and a pointer to whatever comes after the both branches of the if-condition.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is writing a neat setter for the outward pointers (nextItems). Take a look at the classes :</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FlowChartItem\n{\npublic:\n    //I **need** this setter to stay in the parent class FlowChartItem\n    virtual void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index) = NULL;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FlowChartActionItem:public FlowChartItem\n{\npublic:\n    FlowChartItem* nextItem; //Only 1 next item\npublic: \n    void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FlowChartConditionItem: public FlowChartItem\n{\npublic:\n    FlowChartItem* nextItem;\n    FlowChartItem* trueBranchItem;\n    FlowChartItem* falseBranchItem; //we have 3 next items here\npublic:\n    void SetNextItem(FlowChartItem* nextItem, char index);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I needed a generic setter that doesn't depend on the number of pointers the sub-class is having.\nAs you see I've used char index to tell the setter which pointer is to be set.

But it would behave a little as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object\" rel=\"nofollow\">God object</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make the Language class static. Therefore I would be able to use it from within the Text. I would create a Text instance and call a method with different $id. Similar to using it with globals.

It uses PHP (5.4) and MySQL for database. also installed ActiveRecord library.\nI designed the database with many tables, some for entities:\nhotel, room, users...\nAnd also tables for categories:\ntype, audience, design, area, location, feature...</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: a hotel/room may have more than one category assigned to it from each table (except for location and area) so i also created some lookup tables (e.g. has_audience, has_design...) but these are not important for the menu anyway.</p>\n\n<p>What i did (which i'm almost sure is <strong>not the recommended way</strong>) was creating a <code>class menu</code> as a model:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>class menu extends ActiveRecord\\Model{</p>\n  \n  <p>public  $categories = array('audience','feature','design');

$category): ?&gt;\n\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"?category=&lt;?=$key?&gt;\"&gt;&lt;?=$key?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;?php foreach($category as $item): ?&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"?category=&lt;?=$key?&gt;&amp;id=&lt;?//=$item-&gt;id?&gt;\"&gt;&lt;?=$item-&gt;title?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;?php endforeach;

Everything used to be done by creating large tables in memory, adding and removing rows and columns and parsing everything to strings. It was pretty awful. These tables directly reflected the structure of an underlying database where everything gets stored.</p>\n\n<p>For this problem, I have <code>Layer</code> objects, with about 100 properties, and I have <code>Event</code> objects, with about 20 more properties. I then have a set of about 10 computed values for each <code>Layer/Event</code> pair. These were stored as a third table with a foreign keys pointing to each of the other tables.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to create a proper object oriented class for storing this data and quickly accessing values like you would in a dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to index the results in a dictionary, but I feel its use would be unintuitive:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct EventLayerResult { Decimal sum = 0; Long events = 0; Decimal average; ...}\n//Performing Calculations\nDictionary&lt;Tuple&lt;Event,Layer&gt;, EventLayerResult&gt; _EventLayerResults ...;\nforeach(Event evt in _Events)\n    foreach(Layer lyr in _Layers)\n        EventLayerResult elr = newLayerLosses[Tuple.Create(evt, lyr)];\n        elr.sum += currentValue;\n        elr.events += 1;\n        elr.average += elr.Sum/elr.Events;\n        etc...\n//Using results\nEventLayerResult temp = _EventLayerResults.TryGetValue(Tuple.Create(evt, lyr))\nsomeLoss = temp == null ? 0 : temp.expectedLoss;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't like the idea of having to call Tuple.Create or create new instances of temporary objects every time I create a value. Furthermore, unlike a table, if I want to bind this table in the UI, I can't just bind to Field=\"Layer\", Field=\"Event\", Field=\"Loss\", etc, I have to come up with complex binding expressions which extract <code>Key.Layer</code>, <code>Key.Event</code>, <code>Value.Loss</code>, etc. For that reason, I want to avoid such a data structure.</p>\n\n<p>I could wrap this in an object which lets me easily lookup each value for an Event/Layer combination, but I don't believe I should have to create a 'get' method for each calculated property so that I can use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>thisSum = _EventLayerResults.getSum(evt, lyr);\nthisEvent = _EventLayerResults.getExpectedLoss(evt, lyr);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also think binding to the full list of results contained in such a structure would be impossible.</p>\n\n<p>My final thought (the one I think is closest to the solution I must use) is a simple collection of objects/structs with all the fields I need to reference:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EventLayerResult { Event oevent; Layer layer; Decimal sum; Long events...}\nObservableCollection&lt;EventLayerResult&gt; _EventLayerResults = ....\n_EventLayerResults.Add( new EventLayerResult(){ oevent = evt, layer = lyr } );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is super easy to bind to, but the problem is there's no 'indexing' on this collection. I'm looking at O(Nevts * Nlyrs) time to look up specific Event/Layer results later on unless I start adding on all this extra baggage like a custom wrapper class that monitors the collection Add event and indexes the collection item in a dictionary, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I can't imagine other people go through all of this every time they want to convert a simple table indexed by two foreign keys into an object model. Is there a standard approach or data structure I'm not aware of that can make this sort of data set simple to work with?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","database","django","oop","deepcopy"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":0,"question_id":12182657,"title":"Copy or clone an object instance in Django/Python","body":"<p>I've following scenario:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CourseTemplate(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=70)\n    teacher = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    description = models.TextField()\n\n    max_students = models.IntegerField()\n    sessions = models.ManyToManyField(CourseSession) # e.g. Session 1 Introduction, Session 2 Basics, etc.\n    rating = models.ManyToManyFields(StudentRating)\n    date_added = models.DateTimeField()\n\nclass CourseEnrollment(models.Model):\n    course = models.OneToOneField(CourseTemplate) # Each enrollment needs a new CourseTemplate Instance, so I can track it\n    students = models.ManyToManyField(User)\n\nClass CourseSession(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    date = models.DateTimeField()\n    details = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    address = models.TextField()\n    #parent_course = models.ForeignKey(CourseTemplate)\n\nclass StudentRating(models.Model):\n    student = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    rating = models.IntegerField()\n    #course = models.ForeignKey(CourseTemplate)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now a teacher (=User) can create a CourseTemplate with all the required details first.

I use static methods like <code>find_by_id($int)</code> that generate objects of the called class dynamically. I am using Late Static Bindings to gain access to the name of the called class and I use the <code>$stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS, $class_name)</code> to instantiate these objects with the data from the database automatically converted into objects. </p>\n\n<p>In each static method I instantiate an instance of the DatabaseMySQL class. In each static method I set the correct static <code>$table</code> name to be used in the SQL queries dynmically by getting the name of the class and appending an <code>s</code> to it. So if my class was <code>User</code>, that would make the table name <code>users</code>. </p>\n\n<p>In my constructer I have placed an optional array which can be used to insert some variables as properties of an object as it is created.

To continue with my changes, I then changed the classes that needed the new enum to Implement Interface B instead of Interface A since it was Inherited by Interface B.  I thought about Implementing both Interfaces in my classes that needed them but I'm using the Interface throughout the code and would like to just use one Interface for looking through classes and not two.   </p>\n\n<p>I hope this was clear enough (probably to long) but if anyone can give me some advice on this either I'm doing it right or I'm doing it wrong please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","parameters","variable-scope"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12125899,"title":"variable ambit and sending parameters in php OO","body":"<p>I'm very confuse about using the parameters through Pages with PHP OO.\nI'm following a tutorial about creating a framework (it's just like zend Framework), But what I don't understand is when this happens:\nEx: \nThe index : </p>\n\n<pre><code>// File: sourcefiles/index.php\n\ndefine('DS', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);\ndefine('ROOT', realpath(dirname(__FILE__)).DS );\ndefine ('APP_PATH',(ROOT.'aplicacion'));\n\nrequire_once APP_PATH.

A certain piece of information about this contact is stored as a <code>Detail</code> in the <code>Contact</code> (in a <code>std::multimap</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Each detail, then, must follow some rules. For instance: it has to comply to some formatting rules (e.g. a phonenumber must match <code>%d%d %d%d/%d%d %d%d %d%d</code>), based on it's type. All the rules for a certain type are stored inside the <code>Detail_Type</code> class, which holds the regexes and some routines for checking them etc...</p>\n\n<p>What I would like is that, when constructing a <code>Detail</code>, one has to supply which <code>Detail_Type</code> it is (by name: eg <code>Detail det(\"phone\");</code>).

Specifically, tonight I was trying to write a simple class that takes in events and switches between multiple images, with a pointer to each image stored in an array. I ran into a confusing problem when trying to make a 'getter' function that returns a pointer to the array itself.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I was trying to do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class SlideShow\n{\npublic:\n    image *getSlideArray();\nprivate:\n    image *slideArray[10];\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, I wanted to have an array that stores pointers to each image. And I also wanted to have a function that returns the address of the array itself. I ran into an issue when trying to define the getSlideArray() function... I'm just not entirely sure why it wasn't working...</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I tried initially, in my class' source file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>image *SlideShow::getSlideArray()\n{\n    return this-&gt;slideArray;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this attempt, the compiler kept raising issues with the use of the 'this' keyword, saying that what I was trying to return was not of the previously specified type. However, this is the way that I've been writing my getter functions up until now, and it generally works when using simple variables... My suspicion is that there is some problem here due to the fact that 'this' is a pointer, and 'slideArray' is a pointer to an array that also contains pointers... But I'm terrible and that level of referencing kind of goes over my head right now. It's been taking me a while just to gather a basic understanding of pointers, referencing using address &amp; operator, etc. Pointers to pointers and arrays of pointers are even more confusing.</p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that I found one work around, in which my code compiles. (Although I can't really run it to check and see if it works at runtime yet..) My work around involved adding the definition/return statement to the class declaration itself (inside the header file):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class SlideShow\n{\npublic:\n    image *getSlideArray() {return *slideArray;);\nprivate:\n    image *slideArray[10];\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now. This compiled correctly... BUT, it's also confusing to me. I know that generally, when you return an array (say, an array of ints), you are returning the address of the zeroth slot of the array. But if I was trying to return an intArray[5], when returning it, I would simply write 'intArray', correct? Essentially, I'm not confused as to why I have to add the * before 'slideArray' in this situation...</p>\n\n<p>So no matter which way I try and do it, it's confusing me. I know that there is some 'trick' here, and that it probably has to do with returning pointers to pointers to pointers or something, but I just haven't been able to work it out myself. I really am hoping to learn this subject so that I can start to get a handle on programming, especially OOP...</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help me understand this better?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","oop","object","object-literal"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12087571,"title":"Methods and sub-methods in JS object literals","body":"<p>So if I declare an object in Javascript like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myhouse = {\n    room: {\n        bed: function() { return \"sleep\"; }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myhouse.room.bed();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can I make a method that's callable with just:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myhouse.room();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>?

I strongly disagree with that. Therefore I want to have a Data Access Layer (DAL) so that my domain layer remains portable by not having any \"ZF stuff\" in it. I have searched around but have not really found exactly what I wanted. Heads up: I am new to ZF.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>DAL structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, the first problem is where to place the Data Access Layer. While it could certainly be placed within the <code>library</code> folder and adding a namespace to the autoloader, that does not seem logical as it is specific to my application (so the <code>applications</code> folder is suitable). I am using a modular structure. I am thinking of using the below structure:</p>\n\n<p><code>/application/modules/default/dal/</code></p>\n\n<p>However, I am not sure how include this folder so that I can access the classes within the controllers (without using includes/requires).

The problem is I'm not sure where to store the data and logic to do with where on the screen each item should be positioned, and how to check if it is being hovered over, etc. My original idea was to store and set a selected property on each menu item, which could be rendered differently by different views, but even then how to I deal with positioning the graphical elements that make up the button?</p>\n\n<p>Code excerpts so far follow: (more code at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3422226\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/3422226</a>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Abstract menu model\n *\n * Menus have many items and have properties such as a title\n */\nclass menu {\nprotected:\n    std::string _title;\n    std::vector&lt;menu_item*&gt; _items;\npublic:\n    std::string get_title();\n    void set_title(std::string);\n    std::vector&lt;menu_item*&gt; get_items();\n};\n\nclass menu_controller: public controller {\nprivate:\n    menu* _menu;\npublic:\n    menu_controller(menu*);\n\n    virtual void update();\n};\n\nclass menu_item {\nprotected:\n    std::string _title;\npublic:\n    menu_item(std::string title);\n    virtual ~menu_item();\n\n    std::string get_title();\n};\n\nclass menu_renderer: public renderer {\nprivate:\n    menu*   _menu;\n    bitmap  _background_bitmap;\n    static font _title_font;\n    std::map&lt;menu_item*, menu_item_renderer*&gt; _item_renderers;\n\npublic:\n    menu_renderer(menu*);\n\n    virtual void render();\n};\n\nfont menu_renderer::_title_font = NULL;\n\nmenu_renderer::menu_renderer(menu* menu) {\n    _menu = menu;\n    _background_bitmap = ::load_bitmap(\"blackjack_menu_bg.jpg\");\n    if (!_title_font)\n        _title_font = ::load_font(\"maven_pro_regular.ttf\",48);\n}\n\nvoid menu_renderer::render() {\n    ::draw_bitmap(_background_bitmap, 0, 0);\n\n    /* Draw the menu title */\n    const char* title = _menu-&gt;get_title().c_str();\n    int title_width = ::text_width(_title_font, title);\n    ::draw_text(title, color_white, _title_font, screen_width() - title_width - 20, 20);\n\n    /* Render each menu item */\n    std::vector&lt;menu_item*&gt; items = _menu-&gt;get_items();\n    for (std::vector&lt;menu_item*&gt;::iterator it = items.begin(); it != items.end(); ++it) {\n        menu_item* item = *it;\n        if (!_item_renderers.count(item))\n            _item_renderers[item] = new menu_item_renderer(item, it - items.begin());\n        _item_renderers[item]-&gt;render();\n    }\n}\n\nclass menu_item_renderer: public renderer {\nprivate:\n    unsigned _order;\n    menu_item* _item;\n    static font _title_font;\npublic:\n    menu_item_renderer(menu_item*, unsigned);\n    virtual ~menu_item_renderer();\n\n    virtual void render();\n};\n\nfont menu_item_renderer::_title_font = NULL;\n\nmenu_item_renderer::menu_item_renderer(menu_item* item, unsigned order) {\n    _item = item;\n    _order = order;\n    if (!_title_font)\n        _title_font = ::load_font(\"maven_pro_regular.ttf\",24);\n}\n\nmenu_item_renderer::~menu_item_renderer() {\n    // TODO Auto-generated destructor stub\n}\n\nvoid menu_item_renderer::render() {\n    const char* title = _item-&gt;get_title().c_str();\n    int title_width = ::text_width(_title_font, title);\n    unsigned y = 44 * _order + 20;\n    ::fill_rectangle(color_red, 20, y, title_width + 40, 34);\n    ::draw_text(title, color_white, _title_font, 30, y + 5);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","collections","json-encode"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":0,"question_id":12067516,"title":"PHP Object+Collections to JSON Using json_encode","body":"<p>In PHP, I have a product object that contains a collection of attributes.  json_encode produces this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"id\":\"123\",\"name\":\"abc\",\"attributes\":{\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"sku\",\"value\":\"xyz\"}]}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\"attributes\" listed twice is redundant.

But how are these points consistent with the fact that if I modify <code>display()</code> as follows:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Animal{  \n   String name = \"Animal\";  \n   public void display(){  \n    System.out.println(\"Current class is \"+ this.getClass().getName());  \n    System.out.println(\"My name is \"+ name);  \n   }  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then the result of:  </p>\n\n<pre><code> Dog d = new Dog();  \n d.display();  \n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Current class is <strong>Dog</strong><br>\n  My name is animal</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was expecting that <code>this</code> inside the <code>display</code> would be <code>Animal</code> as I understood the answers here. But it is not. Why?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop","class","static","inner-classes"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":1,"question_id":12052560,"title":"Access Modifiers in Java (static)","body":"<p>I got this program <a href=\"http://www.codeforge.com/read/147427/Term.java__html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> and I combined the two classes into one for practice purposes.

Don't we always?</p>\n\n<p>In that spirit, after adding some coverage (as in test coverage) I've applied\nseveral known refactorings/improvements to help with this task. Here's what I've\ndone (actually I've done a lot more, but these are the relevant bits to my question):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Added some PORO objects to offload some tasks being performed in models, controllers, even in views.</li>\n<li>Used *decent_exposure* to get rid of the instance variable hell the view layer was in.</li>\n<li>Implemented some for-views decorators using <em>draper</em> to avoid having so much logic in views.</li>\n<li>Added presenters for actions spawing multiple models.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, I (optimistically) expected all this will pay off. It is better in deed, but after throwing everything but the kitchen sink, I would have expected it to be <em>lots</em> better. It's not.</p>\n\n<p>Since I have a view layer that literally is rendering like 10-15 partials on a single action, I'm concerned about my ability to change things in the controller or the view layer. I don't want to go through all this partials whenever I decide the members for an account are called \"members\" or just \"users\". I'm caring about this because the model layer is scheduled to suffer more significant change. </p>\n\n<p>What I initially thought (and still stand on) is to have dumb views. I want most part of my view layer to avoid knowing about the models they're rendering at all. I want an intermediary object that will know how to do two things: extracting the data it needs from the model, and rendering the HTML. And before you tell me I'm violating SRP here, the real responsability for this object can be read as \"displaying a model to the end user\".</p>\n\n<p>In an over-simplification, I would like my views (at least these aforementioned ones) to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>= some_object.render\n= another_object.render\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It does sound like the decorator pattern, and it does also sound like the presenter pattern, at least this is what I've though. </p>\n\n<p>Then I started thinking I would be debiating significantly from MVC (at the least the MVC that rails exposes), so I wanted to know whether this would be the best solution (other than the obvious, nearly impossible with this time-constrains, REWRITE), so I'm more confident about making the shot.</p>\n\n<p>So, with that context, my real questions boils down to:</p>\n\n<p>a) Is switching to MVP, MVVM, MV-whatever the right solution for this problem?</p>\n\n<p>b) If it is, can you tell me about the best solution I could use for this some_object.render view style?</p>\n\n<p>c) If not, can tell you tell how to avoid the hard dependency between those partials and views in general, with a model layer that's could be hours away from being significantly rewritten?</p>\n\n<p>d) Hope you don't get here: YAGNI, so fix afterwards? I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need it.</p>\n\n<p>There's another option that crossed my mind and brought to IRC, not really with the spirit of the title but a valid one (although I'd think overkill for the task at hand):</p>\n\n<p>e) Add a service layer, and make my views map to the \"logical\" models on that service layer, so I'm able to change the physical models independently of the views. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","class","login","user"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":7,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11861,"score":7,"question_id":4707053,"title":"PHP user class (login/logout/signup)","body":"<p>Started experimenting with building classes, and I've began by converting my user registration/login into a single class.

Essentially, each class in the <code>graph</code> hierarchy has a corresponding class in the <code>succ_iterator</code> hierarchy.  For instance one graph may be implemented using <code>std::vector</code> to store adjacency lists explicitly (in that case the <code>succ_iterator</code> is a simple wrapper above <code>std::vector::const_iterator</code>), while another graph might be computed on-the-fly (in that case its <code>succ_iterator</code> instance will actually <em>compute</em> the successors as it progresses).   I don't know the nature of the graphs at compile time, so this rules out a <code>template</code>-based implementation <em>√† la</em> STL.</p>\n\n<p>I have thought about allowing each graph to handle a pool of <code>succ_iterator</code>. This seems to require an extra <code>graph::succ_release(succ_iterator*)</code> method to return the iterator to the pool instead of deleting it.   Most pools I have seen are done at the memory level: i.e., when you release an object, its destructor is called, but the occupied memory is retained so that the next object will be created (with an in-place constructor) in the same block.  It seems this still wastes time as the in-place constructor will have to setup a virtual-table pointer that is the same as that of the previous object.   I think in such a pool I should replace <code>delete</code>+<code>new</code> by a <code>recycle()</code> method that has the same prototype as the constructor.   As the code base is quite large, and this requires an interface change, <strong>I'd like to hear about other design ideas or possible improvements</strong> before I implement this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I don't use threads.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":87,"score":2,"question_id":12027132,"title":"PHP OOP newbie - Need to get $_POST data into a variable","body":"<p>I was basically playing around with OOP and was creating a way to validate and sanitise input when I started to run into problems sanitising and then performing further validation.

After I initialize one of those classes I store the instance and use that whenever I call a method (via __call, let me know why it's bad to use __call).</p>\n\n<pre><code>class item {\n    // Instance of the core class or module class\n    private $instance;\n\n    function __construct($module,$id) {\n        $class = __CLASS__;\n        $class_core = $class.'_core';\n        $class_module = $class.'_'.$module;\n\n        // Module class\n        if(class_exists($class_module)) $this-&gt;instance = new $class_module($module,$id);\n\n        // Core class\n        else $this-&gt;instance = new $class_core($module,$id);\n    }\n    // Catch all calls, redirect accordingly\n    function __call($name,$arguments) {\n        if($this-&gt;instance) {\n            if(method_exists($this-&gt;instance,$name)) return $this-&gt;instance-&gt;$name();\n        }\n    }\n}\nclass item_core {\n    public $module, $id;\n\n    function __construct($module,$id) {\n        $this-&gt;module = $module;\n        $this-&gt;id = $id;\n    }\n\n    function id() {\n        return $this-&gt;id;\n    }\n}\n\nclass item_photos extends item_core {\n    function __construct($module,$id) {\n        parent::__construct($module,$id);\n    }\n\n    function id() {\n        return \"photo-\".$this-&gt;id;\n    }\n\n    function photo_width() {\n        return 250; // Just some sample value\n    }\n}\n\n$item = new item('photos',123);\nprint \"photo id: \".$item-&gt;id().\"&lt;br /&gt;\"; // photo-123\nprint \"photo size: \".$item-&gt;photo_width().\"&lt;br /&gt;\"; // 250\n\n$item = new item('videos',456);\nprint \"video id: \".$item-&gt;id().\"&lt;br /&gt;\"; // 456\nprint \"video size: \".$item-&gt;photo_width().\"&lt;br /&gt;\"; // nothing (that method doesn't exist in the videos module)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyone see any problems with this or anyway to improve it? It still seems a bit off to me.</p>\n\n<p>/<strong><em>*</em>***<em></strong> Edit 3 <strong></em>**<em>*</em>****</strong>/</p>\n\n<p>Alright, seems to me the thing I want to do is be able to return a different instance than I called up.  So, call new item($module,$id);, but if $module == photos (in my example) I'd want to return an instance of new item_photos($module,$id);.  So far I've come up with 2 possible solutions.</p>\n\n<p>First is what I outlined in Edit 2 (see above).</p>\n\n<p>Second option would be to simply call a function (probably 'item') and return the correct object instance there (since functions can return any object instance you want while the class constructor only returns an instance of its own class).  So (basic example):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function item($module,$id) {\n    $class_module = 'item_'.$module;\n    // Module class\n    if(class_exists($class_module)) return new $class_module($module,$id);\n    // Core class\n    else return new item($module,$id);\n}\nclass item{..}\nclass item_photos{..}\n\n$item = item('photos',123);\nprint $item-&gt;id(); // photo-123\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not sure I like mixing function/classes, but it does the trick pretty simply.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","class","object"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":5,"view_count":118,"score":-4,"question_id":12009994,"title":"Memory segmentation","body":"<p>I was asked these questions in a interview.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why exactly Binary code and Data was separated i.e why did they plan for Data segment why not everything inside code segment?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>2.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A\n{\nprivate :\n    int i;\npublic:\n    void show()\n    {\n        printf(\"hello\");\n    }\n};\nint main()\n{\n    A* a = NULL; (what happens in object table?)\n        A* aa =  new A();  (what happens in object table?)\n\n        a-&gt;show();\n    aa-&gt;show();\n\n    delete aa;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How exactly aa and a are different and how exactly object behaves inside memory.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","class"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":1,"question_id":11999124,"title":"A global static class to contain data","body":"<p>I want to have a static class that would hold different kinds of data (like directories, values, etc.).

For this discussion I will mainly talk about two specific classes. An <code>Object</code> and <code>Sprite</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Object</code> is the base class for any type of object in the game. <code>Sprite</code> inherits directly from <code>Object</code>, but some of <code>Object</code>'s public methods no longer make sense. Here is some code to explain:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Object {\npublic:\n    Object() : renderer(NULL), controller(NULL), collider(NULL) { }\n    virtual ~Object();\n\n    Renderer *getRenderer() const;\n    Controller *getController() const;\n    Collider *getCollider() const;\n\n    void setRenderer(Renderer *renderer);\n    void setController(Controller *controller);\n    void setCollider(Collider *collider);\nprivate:\n    Renderer *renderer;\n    Controller *controller;\n    Collider *collider;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Object</code> has three components a renderer, collider, and a controller.  <code>Sprite</code> of course has these three components, but uses a <code>SpriteRenderer</code>. I figured then I would not want the <code>setRenderer</code> method exposed for the sprite class.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought that I should write the sprite class as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Sprite : protected Object {\npublic:\n    Sprite(Texture *texture) : Object(), texture(texture) {\n        setRenderer(new SpriteRenderer(this));\n    }\n\n    Renderer *getRenderer() const;\n    Controller *getController() const;\n    Collider *getCollider() const;\n\n    void setController(Controller *controller);\n    void setCollider(Collider *collider);\nprivate:\n    Texture *texture;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the getters and setters just call the relevant <code>Object</code> method.

I also follow a \"<strong>one def per file</strong>\" paradigm in order to keep things organized, so the various class defs are stored in <strong>separate files</strong> where the file names correspond to the names of the respective classes.</p>\n\n<p>As with everything in life, there are some advantages, but also some inherent disadvantages to such an approach:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aspect 1</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Over short or long, you'll end up with an inheritance structure that doesn't match the alphabetical file order of the individual source files anymore. So simply sourcing one file after another will result in an error at a particular point where some required superclass hasn't been sourced yet.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dir.create(\"classes\", showWarnings=FALSE)\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"A\\\", contains=\\\"B\\\", fields=list(x.3=\\\"logical\\\"))\", \n    file=\"classes/class_A.R\")\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"B\\\", contains=\\\"C\\\", fields=list(x.2=\\\"numeric\\\"))\", \n    file=\"classes/class_B.R\")\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"C\\\", fields=list(x.1=\\\"character\\\"))\", \n    file=\"classes/class_C.R\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>class_A.R</code> is the first file in folder <code>classes</code>, but in order to source it we first need to source <code>class_B.R</code> (as this file defines class <code>B</code>) which in turn requires class <code>C</code> and thus the prior sourcing of <code>class_C.R</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The correct collation thus is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>c(\"class_C.R\", \"class_B.R\", \"class_A.R\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Aspect 2</strong> </p>\n\n<p>For certain tasks you do want/need a \"<strong>multiple defs per file</strong>\" paradigm: quick &amp; easy distribution of necessary objects/functions/classes to worker processes when parallalizing, organizing code when actually building a package etc. </p>\n\n<pre><code>path &lt;- \"classes/classes.R\"\nfile.create(path)\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"C\\\", fields=list(x.1=\\\"character\\\"))\", \n    file=path, append=TRUE)\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"B\\\", contains=\\\"C\\\", fields=list(x.2=\\\"numeric\\\"))\", \n    file=path, append=TRUE)\nwrite(\"setRefClass(Class=\\\"A\\\", contains=\\\"B\\\", fields=list(x.3=\\\"logical\\\"))\", \n    file=path, append=TRUE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Ad Aspect 1</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I don't like the idea of keeping some sort of manual collation reference that specifies the correct sourcing order as I think that's a job the computer can easily do for me (finding out the correct collation). The only thing you need to do here is to find out each class' superclasses (sort of its dependencies), then retrieving the correct collation is a piece of cake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>In case someone's interested: I did come up with a working approach for this. Just drop me a line in case you'd like to see some code. It's based on parsing (without evaluating) the respective class def source files in order to investigate the value of the <code>contains</code> argument which lists the superclasses.  The whole process is then recursively repeated for the source files of those superclasses until you eventually end up with the correct collation. It's not that time consuming either.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the outline:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x &lt;- list.files(\"classes\", full.names=TRUE)    \ncode &lt;- base::parse(file=x[1])\n\n&gt; code \nexpression(setRefClass(Class=\"A\", contains=\"B\", fields=list(x.3=\"logical\")))\n\nsuperclasses &lt;- eval(code[[1]][[\"contains\"]])\n&gt; superclasses\n[1] \"B\"\n\n# Next: investigate source file for class 'B'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Ad Aspect 2</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I also don't like manual copy &amp; pasting, so I implemented a routine that allows me to consolidate source code either stored in individual files or drawn from the respective objects to a single \"consolidated\" file (via <code>deparse(&lt;source_code_expression&gt;)</code> and <code>write(..., append=TRUE)</code>). As for classes, the correct collation also matters here, otherwise there'll be errors again when you try to source the consolidated file.</p>\n\n<p>For both aspects it'd be nice to be able to choose how to get to the actual source code/expression for classes/functions/methods: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>either based on investigating the code stored in the respective\nsource files (<code>parse(file=*)</code>)</li>\n<li>or based on accessing the desired information directly from the\nrespective object.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The second option would be the link to the actual question above. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","generics","oop","throwable"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":842,"score":6,"question_id":2444633,"title":"Why doesn't Java support generic Throwables?","body":"<pre><code>class Bouncy&lt;T&gt; extends Throwable {     \n}\n// Error: the generic class Bouncy&lt;T&gt; may not subclass java.lang.Throwable\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why doesn't Java support generic <code>Throwable</code>s?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that type erasure complicates certain things, but obviously Java gets by with a lot already, so why not push it one more notch and allow generic <code>Throwable</code>s, with comprehensive compile-time check for potential problems?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I feel like the type erasure argument is rather weak.

It's parent class, GameObject also has this update method, which brings up an error message if it is accidentally called - \"GameObject update should be overridden'.</p>\n\n<p>So in my code, I'm calling the update method of 'Viking' with the following method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    #pragma mark UPDATE_METHOD\n-(void) update:(ccTime)deltaTime\n{\n    CCArray *listOfGameObjects = \n    [sceneSpriteBatchNode children];\n    for (GameObject *tempChar in listOfGameObjects) {\n        CCLOG(@\"engine found %@\",tempChar);\n        [tempChar updateStateWithDeltaTime:deltaTime\n andListOfGameObjects:listOfGameObjects];\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, this is supposed to call the 'updateStateWithDeltaTime' method in Viking. But somehow, it's calling the parent method in GameObject which says 'updatestate should be overridden'. How do I override the parent method?</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Carl</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","oop","gui","tkinter"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":3,"question_id":11967015,"title":"Python won't recognise attribute","body":"<p>I am coding my first GUI application to find products for a company. </p>\n\n<pre><code>from Tkinter import *\nimport tkMessageBox\n\ndef debug():\n    buttonText = relStatus.get()\n    tkMessageBox.showinfo(\"You Clicked \", buttonText)\n    return\n\napp = Tk()\napp.title(\"Ironcraft Product Finder\")\napp.geometry(\"700x500\")\n\nlabelText = StringVar()\nlabelText.set(\"Choose an Appliance Type\")\ntopLabel = Label(app, textvariable = labelText, height = 5).pack()\n\nfire = Button(app, text=\"Fire\", width=20, command=debug)\nfire.pack(padx=10)\n\nrelStatus = StringVar()\nrelStatus.set(fire.text)\n\napp.mainloop()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run this, it comes up with the error message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AttributeError: Button instance has no attribute 'text'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But in the creation of 'fire' it says </p>\n\n<pre><code>text=\"fire\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Isn't this an attribute?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":78,"score":-1,"question_id":11969975,"title":"Type hinting in PHP constructors?","body":"<p>Is there anything to stop me from type hinting like this within the __constructors parentheses?</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass SomeClass extends BaseClass {\n\n    public function __construct(array $someArray) {\n\n        parent::__construct($someArray);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or can I only do it like this?</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass SomeClass extends BaseClass {\n\n    public function __construct($someArray = array()) {\n\n        parent::__construct($someArray);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is what works: (Thanks @hakra and @Leigh)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass SomeClass extends BaseClass {\n\n    public function __construct( array $someArray = NULL ) {\n\n        parent::__construct( (array) $someArray);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To me it looks nice and clean and I know exactly what it supposed to mean.</p>\n"},{"tags":["oop","glossary","principles"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":16,"up_vote_count":25,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5234,"score":25,"question_id":62539,"title":"What is the Dependency Inversion Principle and why is it important?","body":"<p>What is the Dependency Inversion Principle and why is it important?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","design","encapsulation"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":11968252,"title":"Exposing template member field","body":"<p>It is generally a bad idea to expose the internal structure of a class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClass {\n  public:        \n    double&amp; Val() { return m_val; } // &lt;---------- Bad\n    double const&amp; Val() const { return m_val; } \n\n  private:\n    double m_val;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what about:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass MyClass {\n  public:        \n    T&amp; Val() { return m_val; } // &lt;---------- Bad/Good?\n    T const&amp; Val() const { return m_val; } \n\n  private:\n    T m_val;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the user of that class already knows of the existence or at least reliance of <code>MyClass&lt;T&gt;</code> on type <code>T</code> (he chose <code>T</code>). </p>\n\n<p>Is it any better than the first case?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason I need to access <code>m_val</code> from the outside is to modify it in some way.

I use three tables <code>clients</code>, <code>content</code> and <code>media</code> which i want to use on the <em>my work</em> page.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about my structure and came up (in my head, no clue how to achieve it) with something like</p>\n\n<p><pre><code>class Database{}\nclass Content extends Database{}\n     function showMenu(){}\n     function showContent{}\nclass Clients extends Database{}\n     function showClientList{}\n     function showClientDetails{}\nclass Media extends Database{}</pre></code></p>\n\n<p>I already made a database class that establishes a database connection with a public method <code>query($qry)</code>. I started with the <code>Content</code> class and it looks like this at the moment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nclass Content extends Database {\n    public function topMenu($page){\n        $db = new Database();\n        $db->connect();\n        $db->query(\"SELECT m_link, m_title, m_accesskey FROM menu WHERE m_type = 'top'\"); \n        $res = $db->getResult();\n        foreach($res AS $show){\n            if($page == $show['m_link']){\n                echo(\"&lt;li id=\"active\"&gt;$show['m_title'].\"&lt;/li&gt;\\n\");\n            }else{\n                echo(\"&lt;li&gt;$show['m_title'].\"&lt;/li&gt;\\n\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does this make any sense at all by the way?</p>\n\n<p>On my index.php i have the following lines to display the menu (which work fine) <code>$content = new Content(); $content->topMenu($_aGET[0]);</code></p>\n\n<p>The point where i'm loosing it is the way top display either the <em>client list</em> or the <em>client details</em>, which depends on the variable <code>$_aGET[0]</code> (which holds the url)</p>\n\n<p>Suppose i want to display the client details, herefore i need records from all three the tables, so normally i would use a couple of join's, like so</p>\n\n<pre><code>$query = \"\n    SELECT cl.c_id, cl.c_client, cl.c_client_desc, ncc.clco_cl_id, ncc.clco_co_id, co.c_content, ncm.clme_me_id, ncm.clme_cl_id, GROUP_CONCAT(me.m_link) AS images_link\n    FROM clienten AS cl\n    LEFT JOIN norm_cl_co_rel AS ncc ON cl.c_id = ncc.clco_cl_id\n    LEFT JOIN content AS co ON ncc.clco_co_id = co.c_id\n    LEFT JOIN norm_cl_me_rel AS ncm ON cl.c_id = ncm.clme_cl_id\n    LEFT JOIN media AS me ON me.m_id = ncm.clme_me_id\n    WHERE cl.c_client = '\".mysql_real_escape_string($_aGET[1]).\"'\n    AND cl.c_language_id = '\"._LANGUAGE.\"' \n    AND cl.c_active = '1'\n\";</code></pre>\n\n<p>But as far is i understand the OOP thoughts, i should have a method for each tables defined in a class (right?) But how am i going to join these?</p>\n\n<p>Or does my 'story' looks something like: 'Dude, just drop it and stick with procedural coding'?</strike></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ok, after Fluffeh's post i used his example and modified it a bit to test it.

A Sudoku puzzle, for those of you who don't know, is in its most common form a 9x9 matrix of numbers from 1 to 9, with 3x3 squares delineated in a tic-tac-toe like pattern. Some numbers are filled in in advance. The goal of the puzzle is to fill in the remaining numbers, so that no row, column or 3x3 square contains the same number more than once.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, I made a number of classes. A <code>Cell</code> can be an element of a <code>Constraint</code>, which are the rows, columns, and 3x3 squares. A <code>Sudoku</code> is a collection of <code>Constraint</code>s and <code>Cell</code>s. I have a <code>SudokuSolver</code> class which dynamically includes source files with <code>SolverHelper</code> subclass class declarations, and instantiates one of each subclass. A helper has a <code>Solve()</code> function that takes a <code>Sudoku</code> as an argument. It examines the <code>Constraint</code>s and asks its cells to eliminate value possibilities based on what it finds. The program itself just loops over the helpers until none of them report that they were able to eliminate any possibilities anymore.</p>\n\n<p>But the fact that all cells in a row or column line up, has certain corollaries that are taken advantage of in certain solution techniques. So I need to differentiate between rows/columns, and other <code>Constraint</code>s. I could have the rows and columns in different arrays, which is not a bad solution. This has the advantage of allowing a good optimization opportunity: no column ever intersects another, for instance. I could also add a boolean property <code>IsLinear</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Or, and now we get to my question: I could subclass the <code>Constraint</code> class to have a <code>LinearConstraint</code>. But that class would be empty. It would not need to override anything in the <code>Constraint</code> class. It would be a pair of curly braces, and that's it; a <code>LinearConstraint</code> object is special by virtue of being an instance of its class. If I wanted or needed to have special code that pertains to linear constraints, I could always add it.

I've been teaching myself programming using various written and online resources. But, here's my problem (well, one of them...):</p>\n\n<p>On one hand, <em>I understand the importance of abstraction, encapsulation, and having a low degree of coupling between classes</em>, yet, on the other hand, <em>I've been struggling tremendously with structuring my program and designing my classes in a way that allows different classes in different files to know about each other</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is a major problem of mine that has resulted in sloppy, hackish code which only works the way I want it to after I throw every basic principal OOP out the window and start filling my code with globals variables, forward declarations of everything everywhere, and making class members public. </p>\n\n<p><em>Simply put:</em> My programming is a mess... C++ is my first programming language, and even when I try my best to design/write in an object orient way, I end up with an ugly mess of files, #including everything in nearly every file, and an odd mix of procedural and OOP spaghetti code that rarely works!</p>\n\n<p>I'm a self-proclaimed programming novice, and I accept that it takes time to learn how to structure a program, but I'm nearly at wit's end! I know that my problem stems from the fact that I know a <strong>little bit</strong> about OOP. I know that I want to write independent classes that handle a single task. But at the same time, I don't understand how to properly alert each class of the existence of the other parts of the program. It's a little bit like knowing what kinds of food you should eat but not knowing how to use a fork...</p>\n\n<p>That's my problem in a nutshell. And to further follow up with some more specific questions that I have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In C++ multifile project, is it normal/needed to put the main() function inside a class of its own? Or is it the standard thing to leave your main() in the global scope?</p></li>\n<li><p>In previous, procedural programs that I've written in C++, it wasn't uncommon to have a constants variables or #defines in the global scope, at the top of main.cpp file. For example, maybe the dimensions of the screen or other useful information would be defined at the start of the program. What happens in OOP? Is this practice to be avoided completely? Or do I make a MAIN.H file and #include it in every other header in the project? I have no idea what to do about this...</p></li>\n<li><p>When writing my first medium size practice OOP program, my work came to a screeching halt when I began trying to write a StateMachine class. It was my intention to have the StateMachine class contain all the possible screen states that the program would use. However, an issue arose where my StateMachine class seemed to not be aware of some of my other State classes, even though they were all #included. I've seen people do forward declarations of classes before, is that necessary? Should I be spamming forward declarations of classes all over the place or is that a code smell?</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, does the order of #include and forward declaration commands matter?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know this is probably a super basic question, but it's something that has been giving me a really hard time in my transition from single-file procedural c++ beginner programs to multi-file OOP programming. Is there some general rule of thumb for structuring your programs so that everything just works? I've been using include guards, so is there any reason why one can't just #include every header in every source file? Should I have a common.h file that is #included in each header file for each class?</p>\n\n<p>I really appreciate any help/advice that the community can give me. I know that this is a simple, yet important hurdle for me to pass before I can begin developing my OOP skills. I've been trying to drill into my brain the importance of keeping classes separate from each other to the point where I'm not sure how to really set up my classes/files in a way that allows them to really interact with each other!

That library provided highly detailed dumps of any variable you could give it, using color coding to indicate types, and using Reflection to produce a lot of insight into objects (including, depending on what flags you pass, outputting relevant PHPDoc and even source code for objects - especially useful in backtraces).  </p>\n\n<p>At the time I been able to bypass member visibility to output the value of protected and private members of a class.  That proved to be quite useful from a debugging perspective, particularly with respect to detailed error logs we produce.  </p>\n\n<p>To bypass visibility in 5.1, I used the Reflection API, which let you see the value of protected and private members with <code>ReflectionMethod-&gt;getValue($object)</code>.  This of course is a bit of a security bypass, but it's not too bad since if you're going to view and modify values this way, you're pretty clearly breaking the object's intended API.</p>\n\n<p>PHP 5.2 stopped Reflection from being able to access protected/private members and methods.   Of course this was intentional, and considered that ability to be a security concern.  I simply added a try/catch around this piece of my library, and output it if the language allowed it, and didn't if it doesn't.  Java Reflection AFAICR always allowed you to bypass visibility (I believe they are of the opinion that if you want it badly enough, you'll get it one way or another, visibility is just an advertised API for an object, violate this at your own risk).</p>\n\n<p>As a thought exercise, and perhaps to bring my dump library up to date, I'm curious if anyone can think of clever ways to bypass visibility in modern versions of PHP (5.2+, but of particular interest to me is PHP 5.3).</p>\n\n<p>There are three avenues which seem particularly hopeful.  First: mangling serialize/unserialize:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Class Foo {\n    protected $bar;\n    private $baz;\n}\nclass VisibleFoo {\n    public $bar;\n    public $baz;\n}\n\n$f = new Foo();\n$data = serialize($f);\n$visibleData = str_replace($data, 'O:3:\"Foo\":', 'O:10:\"VisibleFoo\":');\n$muahaha = unserialize($visibleData);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course it's more involved than this, because protected members are flagged as such: <code>null</code>*<code>null</code>Property, and private members are bound against their original class name: <code>null</code>OriginalClass<code>null</code>Property (see <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHP Serialization</a>), but theoretically you could clean those all up and trick serialize / unserialize into exposing these values for you.  </p>\n\n<p>This has a few drawbacks: first, it is fragile with respect to language versions.  PHP doesn't (AFAIK) make any guarantee that the data produced by serialize() will remain consistent from version to version (indeed, the way protected and private members are represented has changed since I've used PHP).  Second, and more importantly, some objects declare a __sleep() method, which might have unintended side effects of 1) not giving you access to all the private members, and 2) maybe this will tear down database connections, close file streams, or other side effects of the object thinking it's going to sleep when it is in fact not.</p>\n\n<p>A second option is to try to parse out print_r() or other built-in debugging statements to scrape values.  This has the consequence of being incredibly difficult to do well beyond simple values (my old library would let you drill down into members which are themselves objects, and so forth).  Interestingly it's a variant of this approach that I used to detect infinite recursion (<code>$a-&gt;b = &amp;$a</code>) using var_dump().</p>\n\n<p>A third option is to subclass the target and increase its visibility that way.  This will get you access to protected members, but not to private members.</p>\n\n<p>I seem to recall a few years ago reading a post by someone who had figured out a way to bypass with lambda functions or something to that effect.  I can't find it any longer, and having tried a variety of variations on this idea, I've come up empty.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR version: an anyone think of some magic hoops to jump through to dredge out protected and private members of a PHP object instance?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":2,"question_id":11930735,"title":"Cast var to custom class in Javascript","body":"<p>I've got a custom class in Javascript called Booking:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Booking(technicianID, startTime, start, street, zipcode, jobtypeID) {\n    this.technicianID = technicianID;\n    this.startTime = startTime;\n    this.start = start;\n    this.street = street;\n    this.zipcode = zipcode;\n    this.jobtypeID = jobtypeID;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to use an object of this class as input in a function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function bookTime(inputBooking) {\n    var tmpBooking = inputBooking;\n    alert(\"You chose: \" + tmpBooking.start + \".

I have a few thoughts, but figured it best to bring it up here and see what was considered to be the closest in functionality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the tl;dr crowd:</strong> How do I translate type-classes (a Haskell idiom) into F# idiomatic code?</p>\n\n<p>For those accepting of my long explanation:</p>\n\n<p>This code from the Haskell standard lib is an example of what I'm trying to translate:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Category cat where\n    id :: cat a a\n    comp :: cat a b -&gt; cat b c -&gt; cat a c\nclass Category a =&gt; Arrow a where\n    arr :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; a b c\n    first :: a b c -&gt; a (b,d) (c,d)\n\ninstance Category (-&gt;) where\n    id f = f\ninstance Arrow (-&gt;) where\n    arr f = f\n    first f = f *** id\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Attempt 1: Modules, Simple Types, Let Bindings</strong></p>\n\n<p>My first shot at this was to simply map things over directly using Modules for organization, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type Arrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; = Arrow of ('a -&gt; 'b)\n\nlet arr f = Arrow f\nlet first f = //some code that does the first op\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That works, but it loses out on polymorphism, since I don't implement Categories and can't easily implement more specialized Arrows.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Attempt 1a: Refining using Signatures and types</strong></p>\n\n<p>One way to correct some issues with Attempt 1 is to use a .fsi file to define the methods (so the types enforce easier) and to use some simple type tweaks to specialize.</p>\n\n<pre><code>type ListArrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; = Arrow&lt;['a],['b]&gt;\n//or\ntype ListArrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; = LA of Arrow&lt;['a],['b]&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the fsi file can't be reused (to enforce the types of the let bound functions) for other implementations, and the type renaming/encapsulating stuff is tricky.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attempt 2: Object models and interfaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rationalizing that F# is built to be OO also, maybe a type hierarchy is the right way to do this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>type IArrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; =\n    abstract member comp : IArrow&lt;'b,'c&gt; -&gt; IArrow&lt;'a,'c&gt;\ntype Arrow&lt;'a,'b&gt;(func:'a-&gt;'b) = \n    interface IArrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; with\n        member this.comp = //fun code involving \"Arrow (fun x-&gt; workOn x) :&gt; IArrow\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Aside from how much of a pain it can be to get what should be static methods (like comp and other operators) to act like instance methods, there's also the need to explicitly upcast the results.  I'm also not sure that this methodology is still capturing the full expressiveness of type-class polymorphism.  It also makes it hard to use things that MUST be static methods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attempt 2a: Refining using type extensions</strong></p>\n\n<p>So one more potential refinement is to declare the interfaces as bare as possible, then use extension methods to add functionality to all implementing types.</p>\n\n<pre><code>type IArrow&lt;'a,'b&gt; with\n    static member (&amp;&amp;&amp;) f = //code to do the fanout operation\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ah, but this locks me into using one method for all types of IArrow.  If I wanted a slightly different (&amp;&amp;&amp;) for ListArrows, what can I do?  I haven't tried this method yet, but I would guess I can shadow the (&amp;&amp;&amp;), or at least provide a more specialized version, but I feel like I can't enforce the use of the correct variant.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Help me</strong></p>\n\n<p>So what am I supposed to do here?  I feel like OO should be powerful enough to replace type-classes, but I can't seem to figure out how to make that happen in F#.  Were any of my attempts close?  Are any of them \"as good as it gets\" and that'll have to be good enough?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","oop","posix","scrapy"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":3,"question_id":11894045,"title":"Python Object Lifetime Characteristics","body":"<p>Note : if you know of any (non-elaborate) library code that does what I want please enlighten a C/C++ programmer, I'll accept that as answer.</p>\n\n<p>I have a global variable set to an instance of the following class.

I'm a very inexperienced programmer trying to teach myself the basics of programs that use multiple states.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I have a very simple game-ish program with a game loop that redirects event, logic, and rendering to my StateManager class, which pushes and pops states onto a . The StateManager class then redirects the events, logic, and rendering to whatever state is on the back() of the vector. The idea is to have an assortment of different states for each phase of the program (in this case a simple game with splash screens, menus, gameplay, death screens, etc)...</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm a VERY novice coder (trying my best to learn), and I've run into a fundamental issue with my program right from the very first state class...</p>\n\n<p>The first class that I made is the SplashScreenState. And the basic concept was to have a state that essentially just shows a series of 'splash screen images' (lets say 3, for the sake of example), and each time the user presses a key, it switches to the next image, and finally (when it is out of splash screen images to cycle through) switches to the next state (menustate).</p>\n\n<p><em>My problem is that I'm having a hard time figuring out how to structure this. Originally, I made the mistake of treating each different splash screen image as an instance of the SplashScreenState. However, I figured that do so was incorrect, as all 3 splash screens would technically be part of the same 'state'.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So now I have two main issues:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first issue is that I'm not sure how/where to store all the splashscreen images. If I want to cycle between 3 different screen images when the program starts up, should I make them all members of the SplashScreenState class? Or is it smarter to simply have one class member for the 'currentImage', and each time the user hits a key it runs a load() function to load the next image into the currentImage pointer? Is it better to make an array or vector of images and cycle through them? I'm just not sure...</p></li>\n<li><p>My second issue is with the eventhandling() of the SplashScreenState.. I know that I want the image on the screen to change like; *image1 -> image 2 -> image 3 -> changeState(menuState).. So that each time the user hits a key on their keyboard, it switches to the next splash screen, until the last splash screen, where it will then change state to the main menu. I'm not sure what the best way of doing this is either.. Should I create an enum for each splash screen and increment through them (until the final screen where it changes states)? I also think that, if I did store all my various screens in an array, then I could easily increment through them, but then would that be unoptimized because all the screens would have to be stored in memory at all times?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'm know this question might be very basic and noobish, but that's where I am right now unfortunately!
