What I'm looking for is a way to fix this. Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.DomainClasses\n//POCO classes mapped on Entity Framework.\n\n//Project/Namespace DataAccessLayer.Base\n//Base classes and interfaces for all data access layer, such as:\n\npublic abstract class BaseContext&lt;TContext&gt; : DbContext where TContext : DbContext\n{\n  //To allow multiple contexts sharing the same connection string\n  protected BaseContext(): base(\"name=MyConnectionString\") {}\n}\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; : IDisposable where T : class\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write repository\npublic interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Basic implementation for a read-only repository\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Basic implementation for a read/write repository\npublic abstract class BaseRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Project DataAccessLayer.AccountContext/ Namespace DataAccessLayer\n//Context class:\n\npublic class AccountContext : BaseContext&lt;AccountContext&gt; {}\n\n//With this, I can have simple repositories:\n\npublic class UserRepository : BaseRepository&lt;AccountContext, User&gt;\n{ //All implementation comes from the base abstract class, unless I need to change it (override methods)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a service layer between data access and the application (Windows Forms). Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services\n//Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only service working with a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class {}\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write service working with a read/write repository\npublic interface IService&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Base implementation for a read-only service\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyService&lt;T, R&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Base implementation for a read/write service\npublic abstract class BaseService&lt;T, R&gt; : IService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Concrete sample service\npublic class UserService : BaseService&lt;User, UserRepository&gt;\n{ //As with the repository I can change the default behavior of implementation overriding methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this setup, the only way to compile is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer project.\nHow can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework there?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs (DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code).</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><em>--Edit--Including here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the question--</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three (domain, base data layer and context). My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if it's really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, it's going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too? What's making VS require this?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, I'm inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.</p>\n\n<p>One possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=4.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to avoid having these references? What improvements can I have on this structure?</p>\n\n<p>What I know is that my app certainly doesn't have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. It's a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever (except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget).

Their case centers on the assertion that in the majority of cases a bool parameter signifies that the method actually does two things, one branch for the true case and a second branch for the false case. </p>\n\n<p>Other guidance would tell us that our methods should aim to do one thing and that the <code>if/else</code> should really call out to two methods, one for the true case and the other for the false case. Advocates of this approach say that it will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make unit testing the code easier as you can test smaller blocks</li>\n<li>Help reduce copy/paste of code blocks as single purpose methods are more reusable</li>\n<li>Helps readability by avoiding calling code like <code>DoAbc(true,false,false,true);</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I do agree that from the callers perspective, methods with multiple bool parameters make it hard to work out what the method is actually doing. For example, how is <code>DoAbc(false, false);</code> any different from <code>DoAbc(true, false);</code> I guess right now I rely on intellisense to tell me the parameters names and hope they explain the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Opinion seems to be that methods with one bool type param probably have two code blocks, one for each case. The suggestions seems to be to extract each case to a new method, name the methods appropriately and keep the <code>if/else</code> in the parent method. Alternatively the caller can do the <code>if</code> check (assuming it can take on that responsibility) and call the appropriate one of the two methods. </p>\n\n<p>For methods with more than one bool type param, the suggestion is to consider the use of enumerations along with the extract method approach. If we define enumerations to replace the bools, then our call to <code>DoAbc(true, false)</code> changes to something like <code>DoAbc(OverwriteOptions.Overwrite, CompressOption.Compress)</code> which does seem to be more readable.</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate answers on whether folks agree with the goal of reducing the use of bool params and any other suggestions on how this can be achieved.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13276315,"title":"PHP Mysqli Extension Warning","body":"<p>I have the following code and I can't explain why it outputs an error.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class User extends mysqli{\n\n    // property declaration\n    private $server;\n    private $user;\n    private $pass;\n    private $database;\n    private $conn;\n\n    function __construct($server, $user, $pass, $database){\n\n        $mysqli = new mysqli($server, $user, $pass, $database);\n        if ($mysqli-&gt;connect_errno) {\n            echo \"Connect failed: \". $mysqli-&gt;connect_error;\n            exit();\n        }\n\n        $this-&gt;conn = $mysqli;\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    function __destruct(){\n\n        $conn = $this-&gt;conn;\n        $conn-&gt;close();\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and main code</p>\n\n<pre><code>include(\"global_config.php\");\n\nrequire \"User.php\";\n\n$u = new User($con['server'],$con['user'],$con['pass'],$con['db']);\n\n$u-&gt;query(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns this error</p>\n\n<pre><code>Warning: mysqli::query() [mysqli.query]: Couldn't fetch User in E:\\Xampp\\htdocs\\testphp\\testMysql.php on line 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>normally, it should behave as here <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9727062/php-inheritance-parent-functions-using-child-variables\">PHP inheritance, parent functions using child variables</a></p>\n\n<p>but it doesn't </p>\n\n<p>i've already exhausted my imagination thinking about most possible keywords I could use for a google search</p>\n\n<p>any ideas? </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","database","oop","class","session"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13276556,"title":"Custom PHP Session Class","body":"<p>What I want to do is write a custom PHP session class that stores sessions in the database without using <code>session_set_save_handler()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this is so I can easily store data using <code>serialize()</code> and return it using <code>unserialize()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking all day, can't find anything on this subject.

It seems like Drupal is now doing the same thing, except for the web.</p>\n\n<p>This is definitely good in some aspects, but it seems to have some drawbacks as well. From the perspective of someone with a few years of Web development experience and programming experience, it seems like Drupal has some quirks that take some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>OOP and Namespaces</strong>: Drupal pretty much re-invents Object Oriented programming with its own internal API, and there does not seem to be much impetus to change that, even though PHP has added built-in support for (its own flavor of) OOP. <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/19964\" rel=\"nofollow\">See Drupal on OOP</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>It works for me ...:</strong> Many contrib modules seem to be plagued by use cases that were not initially anticipated by the original author(s). The common response is \"well, at least it works for me\". This is understandable when developers write something first to solve their own particular issues, and then only later adapt it for others (if funding, personal preferences, and time allow). The problem is \"good enough for me\" is an incremental approach that does not work well with large-scale development. The result is a combination of solutions that feel \"duct taped\" together. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Duplicated Standards:</strong> Drupal seems to also re-invent existing technologies and standards even in cases where there does not seem to be a stylistic or strategic benefit in doing so. For example: 1) New .info files; 2) Deployment tools; 3) Re-creation of PHP language features; 4) Re-creation of code and functionality from established open-source libraries.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(The newly-invented <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/171205\" rel=\"nofollow\">.info files</a> (used in configs), are used instead of already built-in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\" rel=\"nofollow\">INI file</a> format of PHP, or the already-used and published <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json\" rel=\"nofollow\">JSON</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\" rel=\"nofollow\">YAML</a>, for cases where INI is not powerful enough. Another example, in contrib modules at least, you can find lots of hand-made regexes used to parse HTML, instead of already-developed full-fledged HTML parsers. Another example, <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/drush\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drush</a> appears instead of any already-known <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software\" rel=\"nofollow\">build language</a> out there (<strong>EDIT</strong>: the build language link is not a good one, I meant to emphasize higher-level tools like Rake, Capistrano, Ant, Maven and others, I am assuming Drush is the closest thing.))</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit testing:</strong> Drupal does not seem to have a strong support for unit testing. Combined with the other factors above, this makes for a challenging environment for those who want to have comprehensive code coverage, especially for cases where Drupal is being used in a work environment with the potential for lots of apps proliferating.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> If you have some Drupal experience, and also some programming experience (especially if it is in other languages in addition to PHP, with native support for OOP), what are some specific pitfalls or even advantages that you have encountered?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","pointers"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13274831,"title":"C++ object dynamic naming","body":"<p>I am new to object oriented programming with c++.

I am not allowed to be copy/pasting our code anywhere, so I will do my best to describe our setup. </p>\n\n<p>We currently have been using the <strong>Object Pooling Pattern</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We have the <code>Main Class</code> file which pools all the necessary subclasses we will need to use later.</p>\n\n<p>We then setup the <code>Main Class</code> file to have a method, which handles developer requests made from anywhere in the website. For example, we have a <code>Sub Class</code> file that generates HTML for us, saving us time in areas that would require rewriting the same HTML code again.</p>\n\n<p>We also have created a wrapper function called <code>run()</code>. We use this wrapper function for interacting anywhere in the website. <code>run()</code>, will make a request to the <code>Main Class</code> and ask for access to <code>Sub Class</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Main Class</code> will determine whether or not that <code>Sub Class</code> file, and <code>Sub Class</code> method exists and is callable. If everything succeeds, the request made from anywhere in the website is then sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> from the <code>Main Class</code>. <em>Keeping in mind of course that the original request was sent to the <code>run()</code> method, and was then validated by the <code>Main Class</code>, before the request was actually sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> AND... has already been instantiated by the <code>Main Class</code>.</em></p>\n\n<p>However, as we amend our code, this setup has seemingly drifted beyond our control.

Right now I have created tests and an interface and class for dealing with ball(throw) scores, which makes sure they aren't invalid, ie. <code>&lt;10</code> or <code>&gt;0</code>.  After implementing this I realized that the ball class is basically just a nullable integer, so maybe I don't even need it... but for now it's there.</p>\n\n<p>Following the ball, I decided the next logical thing to add was a frame interface and class.  This is where I have gotten stuck.  Here is where I'm at:</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace BowlingCalc.Frames\n{\n    public interface IFrame : BowlingCalc.Generic.ICheckValid\n    {\n        void AddThrow(int? score);\n        int? GetThrow(int throw_number);\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace BowlingCalc.Frames\n{\n    public class Frame : IFrame\n    {\n        private List&lt;Balls.IBall&gt; balls;\n        private Balls.IBall ball;\n        private int frame_number;\n\n        public Frame(Balls.IBall ball, int frame_number)\n        {\n            this.ball = ball;\n            this.frame_number = frame_number;\n            balls = new List&lt;Balls.IBall&gt;();\n            check_valid();\n        }\n\n        public void AddThrow(int? score)\n        {\n            var current_ball = ball;\n            current_ball.Score = score;\n            balls.Add(current_ball);\n        }\n\n        public int? GetThrow(int throw_number)\n        {\n            return balls[throw_number].Score;\n        }\n\n        public void check_valid()\n        {\n            if (frame_number &lt; 0 || frame_number &gt; 10)\n            {\n                throw (new Exception(\"InvalidFrameNumberException\"));\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The frame uses my previously implemented ball class through dependency injection to add ball scores to the frame.  It also implements a way to return the score for any given ball in the frame.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do, and where I'm stuck, is I want to add a way to make sure the frame score is valid. (For the moment just the simple case of frames 1-9, where the combined score of both balls must be 10 or less.  I will move on to the  much more complicated frame 10 case later.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is I have no idea how to implement this in a SOLID way.  I was thinking of adding the logic into the class, but that seems to go against the single responsibility principle.  Then I thought to add it as a separate interface/class and then call that class on each frame when its score updates.  I also thought of creating a separate interface, <code>IValidator</code> or something like that, and implementing that in the Frame class.  Unfortunately, I have no idea which, if any, of these is the best/SOLID way of doing things.</p>\n\n<p>So, what would be a good, SOLID way to implement a method that validates the score of a frame?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: Any critique of my code is very welcome.  I am very excited learn to create better code, and happy to receive any help given.</p>\n"},{"tags":["oop","type-safety","compile-time"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":172,"score":0,"question_id":7135340,"title":"Language without type-casting","body":"<p>My question is pretty much what the title says: Is it possible to have a programming language which does not allow explicit type casting?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify what I mean, assume we're working in some C#-like language with a parent <code>Base</code> class and a child <code>Derived</code> class. Clearly, such code would be safe:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Base a = new Derived();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since going up the inheritance hierarchy is safe, but</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dervied b = (Base)a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is not guarenteed safe, since going down is not safe.</p>\n\n<p>But, regardless of the safety, such downcasts are valid in many languages (like Java or C#) - the code will compile, and will simply fail at runtime if the types aren't right. So technically, the code is still safe, but via runtime checks and not compile-time checks (btw, I'm not a fan of runtime checks).</p>\n\n<p>I would personally find complete compile-time type safety to be very important, at least from a theoretical perspective, and at most from the perspective of reliable code. A consequence of compile-time type safety is that casts are no longer needed (which I think is great, 'cause they're ugly anyways). Any cast-like behaviour can be implemented by an implicit conversion operator or by a constructor.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering, are currently any OO languages which provide such a rigourous type safety at compile-time that casts are obsolete? I.e., they don't any allow unsafe conversion operations whatsoever? Or is there a reason this wouldn't work?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any input.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>If I can clarify by example, here's the big reason I hate downcasts so much.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I have the following (loosely based on C#'s collections):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\n{\n     IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();\n\n     IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Filter( Func&lt;T, bool&gt; );\n}\n\npublic class List&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\n{\n    // All of list's implementation here\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now suppose someone decides to write code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;int&gt; list = new List&lt;int&gt;( new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} );\n// Let's filter out the odd numbers\nList&lt;int&gt; result = (List&lt;int&gt;)list.Filter( x =&gt; x % 2 != 0 );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the cast is necessary on that last line. But is it valid? Not in general. Sure, it makes sense that the implementation of <code>List&lt;T&gt;.Filter</code> will return another <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, but this is not guarenteed (it could be any subtype of <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>). Even if this runs at one point in time, a later version may change this, exposing how brittle the code is.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much all of the situations I can think that require downcasts would boil down to something like this example - a method has a return type of some class or interface, but since we know some implementation details, we're confident in downcasting the result. But this is anti-OOP, since OOP actually encourages abstracting from implementation details. So why do we do it anyways, even in purely OOP languages?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","java","c++","oop"],"answer_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":13,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":917,"score":12,"question_id":2289642,"title":"The best learning route into Object Oriented Programming from C?","body":"<p>What is the best route to go for learning OOP if one has done some programming in C.</p>\n\n<p>My intention was first to take the natural leap and \"increment with one\" and go for Stroustrup.

As far as I understand any changes of a static field (done by one of the instances) will be seen by other instances (so static variable is not bound to a specific instance). Moreover, a static field can be changes without usage of any instance (we work directly with the class). So, all these special properties of the static field are related with the way how it can be changed and what be the effect of these changes. But in my case I would like to have a constant (so the \"changes\" issues are not  relevant here). So, probably I do not need to use \"static\". Right?</p>\n\n<p>Second, my set will contain a lot of elements and I do not want to define the value of the set at once (when I create the variable). In other words I would like to declare a set, then add elements to this set step by step. But I cannot do it if I work with constants.

Thanks to the answer I understood that it should be \"final\" and \"static\" (since it is a constant set and it will not be associated with any particular instance, it just should be visible to all instances of the class). However I still have a problem. I wanted to specify the set using \"add\" and I cannot add to the set if it is constant (final). Moreover, I cannot change values of the variables outside methods (why?). Anyway, I do not insist on the usage of \"add\" to define the set. I am ready to define it at once. But I do not know how to do it. I tried things like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>final static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet(\"aaa\",\"bbb\");\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet([\"aaa\",\"bbb\"]);\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet({\"aaa\",\"bbb\"});\nfinal static Set allowedParameters = new HashSet(Arrays.asList({\"userName\"}));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And they did not work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDED 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Can anybody explain me, pleas, the code given by Tadeusz Kopec?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class YourClass {\n    private static void fillSet(Set&lt;SomeType&gt; set) {\n        // here you add elements, like\n        set.add(new SomeType());\n    }\n    private final static Set&lt;SomeType&gt; yourSetField;\n    static {\n        final Set&lt;SomeType&gt; tempSet = new HashSet&lt;SomeType&gt;();\n        fillSet(tempSet);\n        yourSetField = Collection.unmodifiableSet(tempSet);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br>1. The <code>fillSet</code> method has one variable called \"set\". Why it is not used in the method?\n<br>2. What is <code>SomeType()</code> in the <code>fillSet</code>? What does this method do?\n<br>3. What does <code>fillSet</code> do? Later in the example we give an empty set to this method. What for?\n<br>4. What for do we declare <code>tempSet</code> as final?\n<br>5. What exactly <code>unmodifiableSet</code> do? According to the name it generate a set which cannot be modified, I think.

Having no experience with generics and only average experience with creating good OOP designs, this is beginning to prove quite a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I have some feeling that what I'm trying to do cannot actually be done, but that I could come close enough to it. I'll try to explain it as brief as I can. I'm just going to tell straight away that this structure will represent my DAO and service layers to access the database. Making this question more abstract would only make it more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>My DAO layer is completely fine as it is. There is a generic DAO interface and for each entity, there is a DAO interface that extends the generic one and fills in the generic types. Then there's an abstract class that is extended by each DAO implementation, which in turn implement the corresponding interface. Confusing read for most probably, so here's the diagram showing the DAO for Products as an example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ncmi.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing the DAO implementation for Product entities\"></p>\n\n<p>Now for the service classes, I had a similar construction in mind. Most of the methods in a service class map to the DAO methods anyway. <strong>If you replace every \"DAO\" in the diagram above with \"Service\", you get the basis for my service layer.</strong> But there is one thing that I want to do, based on the following idea I have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every service class for an entity will at least access one DAO object, namely the DAO of the entity that it is designed for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is...</p>\n\n<h1>The question/problem</h1>\n\n<p>If I could make a proper OO design to <strong>make each service class have one instance variable for the DAO object of their respective entity</strong> my service layer would be perfect, in my view. <strong>Advice on this is welcome, in case my design is not so good as it seemed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have implemented it like this:</p>\n\n<h2>Class AbstractService</h2>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractService&lt;EntityDAO&gt; {\n\n    EntityDAO entityDAO;\n\n    public AbstractService() {\n        entityDAO = makeEntityDAO(); //compiler/IDE warning: overridable method call in constructor\n    }\n\n    abstract EntityDAO makeEntityDAO();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Class ProductServiceImpl</h2>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProductServiceImpl extends AbstractService&lt;ProductDAOImpl&gt; {\n\n    public ProductServiceImpl() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    ProductDAOImpl makeEntityDAO() {\n        return new ProductDAOImpl();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>The problem with this design is a compiler warning I don't like: it has an overridable method call in the constructor</strong> (see the comment). Now it is <strong>designed</strong> to be overridable, in fact I enforce it to <strong>make sure that each service class has a reference to the corresponding DAO.</strong> Is this the best thing I can do?</p>\n\n<p>I have done my absolute best to include everything you might need and only what you need for this question.

OOP not working: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function","body":"<p>Ok, so backstory is we have a bunch of identical (in function) forms on a page to add variants to a product,\nThe form consists of three major parts.</p>\n\n<h1>The Attribute Editor</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jfmsB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component allows the user to add attributes to a product.\nEach attribute has a <code>visibility status</code>, an <code>attribute key</code>, an <code>attribute value</code> and a <code>delete button</code> which together form one row.  </p>\n\n<p>The component also has an <code>Add Attribute</code> button, which when clicked adds a new row to the bottom of the list.</p>\n\n<p>Each <code>attribute key</code> select list has a <code>new attribute</code> option, which upon selecting launches a modal dialog with a form to enter the new attribute name, this form then submits via AJAX and returns an ID, the new option is then appended to every <code>attribute key</code> select on the page to allow it to be selected.</p>\n\n<p>When a key is selected in an instance of the component all other <code>attribute key</code> select's in the group get that option disabled to prevent duplicate attributes.</p>\n\n<p>The attribute editor gets submitted as part of the main form below.\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h1>The Main Form</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVtuw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component consists of the general description fields of the variant.\nThe form is submitted via AJAX and has the <a href=\"https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery Validation Engine</a> attached for form validation.</p>\n\n<p>Because we are adding new input's dynamically with the attribute editor we must constantly detach, and re-attach the validation engine.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>The Alert System</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jDFJC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis component handles displaying/hiding the error/success/status messages on form by form basis.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<h1>The Issue</h1>\n\n<p>Now there are also a couple of forms that are very similar, but are slight variantions on a couple of the event handlers, so I wanted to create the code so I could replace bits and pieces of it at will without having to copy the entire code.</p>\n\n<p>So after following the tips from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13223618/new-instance-of-object-acting-as-reference/13224068\">this question</a> I ended up with the code below, but I am getting the error: <code>Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function</code> which is on this line: <code>var variantAlert = new VariantAlert(form);</code> which I believe is because I am not returning anything, but I don't know what

Also you can't protect a 'class', as a 'class' can be changed during execution if the developer accidentally changed it, or meant to change it.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Is there a need in javascript to have an explicitly and controlled separation of class structure and instances of the class?

I have heard about model driven transformation (MDT) languages to query/view/transform/operational (QVTO). Is my approach too naive? Would you recommend MDT languages? Any feedback/opinions would be very much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Christian</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","class","object"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":99,"score":1,"question_id":13195594,"title":"When are objects destroyed?","body":"<p>I'm wanting to confirm the behaviour that will happen in the following situation.

I will do my best to accomplish this below in steps, ignore the content above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a class called <code>SineMacula</code>, this contains many methods that do all sorts of things. Think of it as a library like jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>This is defined like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function SineMacula(){\n\n    // Only proceed if jQuery has been loaded\n    if(typeof jQuery=='undefined'){\n        // jQuery has not been loaded\n        console.log('jQuery has not been loaded');\n    }else{\n        this.load = function(options){\n            // Load Sine Macula Libraries here\n        }\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <code>SineMacula</code> class is initiated at the top of each page with the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"//libraries.example.net/jsapi\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n\n    var sm = new SineMacula();\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <code>SineMacula</code> object then loads any required libraries and extensions for the <code>SineMacula</code> object by calling e.g. <code>sm.load({package:'all'})</code>. This will dynamically load any extensions into the webpage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>\n\n<p>The extensions are defined like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SineMacula.prototype.doSomething = function(){\n    // Do something here\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5 - This is where things get a little more complex</strong></p>\n\n<p>Up until now, the <code>SineMacula</code> object has been acting as a namespace for methods such as <code>doSomething()</code> etc.</p>\n\n<p>I would now like to define methods that do more than just act as a function.</p>\n\n<p>Where I would have called <code>SineMacula.doSomething()</code>, I would now like to <strong>be able</strong> to call <code>SineMacula('#test').doSomething()</code> where <code>SineMacula('#test')</code> acts the same as <code>$('#test')</code> in jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>So I can access my functions like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SineMacula.doSomething('maybe parameters here');\nSineMacula('selector').doSomethingElse('maybe parameters here');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the same way that you can call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax('parameters');\n$('selector').animate('parameters');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <strong>if</strong> an argument is passed to the <code>SineMacula</code> object then it is processed using the jQuery <em>selector</em> function and passed as the subject to the method being called.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Call doSomethingElse on the #test element\nSineMacula('#test').doSomethingElse();\n\n// Within the doSomethingElse function $(this) relates to $('#test')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>To summarise...</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>SineMacula('selector')</code> acts as <code>$('selector')</code> if <code>'selector'</code> is supplied, and this gets passed to the child method. But <code>SineMacula</code> is not an extension of jQuery. I do not want <code>SineMacula</code> to be an Alias of <code>$</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","oop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":45,"score":-3,"question_id":13175630,"title":"designing classes and objects in .net for a restaurant assignment","body":"<p>I have received an assignment at School for creating a Restaurant site.

Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Meat (name, color, price) {\n    function newPrice (new_price) {\n        this.price = new_price;\n    }\n this.name = name;\n this.color = color;\n this.price = price;\n this.newprice = newPrice;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Fine and dandy. Now I have the ability to assign a price by using Bacon.price or Bacon.newprice.  Personally, this seems like the highest order of semantics, since functionally it does the same thing. But as an advocate for semantic coding, I'll let it slide. Here's what I want:</p>\n\n<p>When I change the value of Bacon.price, the object should include a function to store the old value in a property called oldprice automatically.  I played around with this, but got nowhere.

I thought that referring to the already assigned value (which would be nothing the first time) before the new value got assigned would be enough. I know that the value (or lack thereof) is stored somewhere before it gets assigned, I just don't know how to refer to it to assign it to the oldvalue property before it gets wiped out.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Okay, maybe the problem is with my eyes or fingers then. Because I thought I had tried the suggestions before asking (I know, I didn't mention them!)  Unless I'm really confused, this should work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Meat(price)\n{\n\n    function setPrice(price)\n    {\n        this.oldprice = this.price;\n        this.price = price;\n    }\n\nthis.price=setPrice;\n}\n\nbacon = new Meat()\nbacon.price = \"Expensive\";\ndocument.write(bacon.price+\"&lt;br /&gt;\");\ndocument.write(bacon.oldprice+\"&lt;br /&gt;\");\nbacon.price = \"Cheap\";\ndocument.write(bacon.price+\"&lt;br /&gt;\");\ndocument.write(bacon.oldprice+\"&lt;br /&gt;\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the output I get is:\n    Expensive\n    undefined\n    Cheap\n    undefined</p>\n\n<p>All okay until that last one.

I have read in Addy Osmani Javascript patterns about interfaces, although my implementation was not the same, and although interface usage is acceptable, it is probably not needed.</p>\n\n<p>It might be simpler to keep the strategy approach but with a different implementation, one that is outlined in Javascript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov, where you have one implementation and based on some form of configuration you know which strategy to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pseudo Sample</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>QueryBuilder = function () {\n   this.types = [];\n}\n\nQueryBuilder.prototype.create = function (type, query) {\n    var strategy = types[type];\n    strategy.create(query);\n};\n\nQueryBuilder.types.Select = {\n\n    create: function (query) {\n        params = query.parameters,\n        paramList = query.parameters.length &gt;= 1 ?

I stuck with the strategy-ish approach in that every strategy defined the same function(s), essentially encapsulating what varied across the implementations and giving them a common contract for want of a better term.  </p>\n\n<p>One thing that changed was the base class/interface which, as correctly pointed was not doing anything constructive was removed, each strategy is independent (so not 100% in the classical representation of the pattern) they, as stated just define the same create function.</p>\n\n<p>From the place where the nested ifs and switches once belonged has been replaced with a single switch which decides which query strategy to use based on the type of query type requested.  This could be re-factored into a factory later on, but for now it serves its purpose:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Query.prototype.generate = function () {\n\nvar self = this,\n    strategy = undefined;\n\nswitch (this.queryType) {\n    case \"SELECT\":\n        strategy = new Select(self);\n        break;\n    case \"INSERT\":\n        strategy = new Insert(self);\n        break;\n    case \"UPDATE\":\n        strategy = new Update(self);\n        break;\n    case \"DELETE\":\n        strategy = new Delete(self);\n        break;\n}\n\nreturn strategy.create();\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each strategy is independently tested, and i feel this is easier to maintain as if something fails, it will fail in one place and investigation will be easier based on the unit tests.

An entry in a configuration file determines which of the\naforementioned three types of sources the application will use.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Client {\n    public function foo() {\n        ...\n        Vocabulary::getTerm();\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nclass Supplier {\n    public function bar() {\n        ...\n        Vocabulary::getTerm();\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nclass Vocabulary {\n    public static function useVocab($vocab) {\n        $_SESSION['vocab'] = $vocab;\n    }\n    public static function getTerm($termKey) {...}\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I planned to create Vocabulary child classes for each of the types I want to support, for example: Vocabulary_file, Vocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql.\nVocabulary_file will override its parent useVocab() because it needs to perform additional operations appart from setting the $_SESSION variable, but\nVocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql don't need to override their useVocab() parent method (they just need the $_SESSION variable set).\nAll three Vocabulary \"child\" classes will override getTerm() method.</p>\n\n<p>The following is what I tried and this is the mess I ended up with :-(</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For Vocabulary_mongodb and Vocabulary_mysql, since useVocab() doesn't exist but is inherited from Vocabulary, \"method_exists()\" returns true and that call\ncauses an infinite loop.</li>\n<li>I looks weird both calling the child explicitly in Vocabulary and calling the parent:: in the child class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After lots of cups of coffee I have exhausted all my wits and my brain is damaged.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Class Vocabulary modified to make it call the desired \"child\" class too\nclass Vocabulary {\n    // This would execute \"child\" class method\n    private static function _callChild($method, $args) {\n        $child_class = 'Vocabulary_' .

When doing so, yes, the Dependency Graph indeed becomes neater. And when I make changes to certain part, because the classes have little dependency between each other, I don't have to worry about messing up the other classes.</p>\n\n<p>But, by doing this method, sometimes, it appears that I have to repeat some code. For example, I could have the following object that's stored in a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class DataBlock {\n   public int id;\n   public string name;\n   public SomeObject dataObj;\n\n   public Object[] Data1 { get { return dataObj.RetrieveInfo(); } }\n\n   public Object[] Data2 { get { return dataObj.SomeProperty; } }\n\n   public bool DoCompare(obj) { ... }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, there is a list called <code>DataList</code> of the type <code>List&lt;DataBlock&gt;</code> consisting the above object.</p>\n\n<p>And then now, suppose I am going to dispatch an event that will include some information from <code>DataBlock</code>. I could include this whole <code>DataBlock</code> object into the <code>EventArgs</code>. The handler function can then just do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Handler(MyEventArgs evtArgs) {\n   DataBlock data = evtArgs.Data;\n   var firstData = data.Data1;\n   data.Data2;\n   firstData.DoCompare(data.Data2)\n   data.name;  //etc, etc\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is convenient. But, this would also mean that the class that has this handler will then now have dependencies on the <code>DataBlock</code> object. So, one of my ways to get rid of this, is within my <code>EventArgs</code>, I <em>repeat</em> all those informations from <code>DataBlock</code>, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyEventArgs : EventArgs {\n\n   public MyEventArgs(id, name, data1, data2) {\n      ID = id;\n      Name = name;\n      Data1 = data1;\n      Data2 = data2;\n   }\n   public int ID { get; private set; }\n   public string name { get; private set; }\n   public Object[] Data1 { get; private set; }\n   public Object[] Data2  { get; private set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By arranging my <code>EventArgs</code> this way, both my <code>EventArgs</code> and whichever class having the event <code>Handler</code> will not have dependency on the <code>DataBlock</code>. Only the firer of the event knows about the <code>DataBlock</code> and it rips off the data from <code>DataBlock</code> and put them into <code>MyEventArgs</code> via its constructor. However, now, the problem in this is, the <code>MyEventArgs</code> is <em>repeating</em> every getters/setters that is inside <code>Datablock</code>. <strong>And, I also lose access to all helper methods within <code>DataBlock</code>!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is just a small example of a problem that I often face. There are more serious ones where I found myself repeating the getters/settings for a few classes, just because I want to reduce the dependency.</p>\n\n<p>Other problems that I face that show up a lot of arrows on the Dependency Graph, is when, say, I have an interface called <code>ISomeObject</code>. Because the <code>ISomeObject</code> is a popular object within the classes, the interface is used by many other parts of the classes. In the end, there are tons of arrows pointing to the <code>ISomeObject</code>. Would this imply spaghetti code too?</p>\n\n<p>It's difficult for me to explain the problems I face when I want to keep my code organised. But I hope the examples above are enough to illustrate what I want to tell.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the best practices for a scenario like this? Should I determine that my code is spaghetti when the Dependency Graph in Visual Studio shows a lot of messy curvy arrows pointing all over the place?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","oop","class","game"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":13004463,"title":"why am i getting a global name error","body":"<p>I am currently encountering the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NameError: global name 'player1_unam' is not defined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If somebody could please look through the following code and give me a soultion to the problem it would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I alpologise in advance because I know it is very messy and inefficient code but i am only a beginner in python.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import os \nimport random\nfrom random import randint\ngame_won = False\np1_playing = True\np2_playing = True\nclass start_game(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        suspect = [\"Miss Scarlet\",\"Colonel Mustard\",\"Mrs. White\",\"Reverend Green\",\"Mrs. Peacock\",\"Professor Plum\"] \n        weapon = [\"Candlestick\",\"Dagger\",\"Lead Pipe\",\"Revolver\",\"Rope\",\"Spanner\"]\n        room = [\"Kitchen\",\"Ballroom\",\"Conservatory\",\"Billiard Room\",\"Library\",\"Study\",\"Hall\",\"Lounge\",\"Dining Room\",\"Cellar\"]\n        rndsuspect = random.randrange(0, 5 ,1)\n        rndweapon = random.randrange(0,5,1)\n        rndroom = random.randrange(0,9,1)\n        answers = []\n        answers.append(suspect[rndsuspect])\n        answers.append(weapon[rndweapon])\n        answers.append(room [rndroom])      \n        print answers[0]\n        print answers[1]\n        print answers[2]\n\nclass game_type:\n    def __init__(self):\n        select_game = raw_input(\"Do you want to start the game?

Is there any solution which would still adhere to OOP principles?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>\nI am aware that PHP does not require type hinting at all but it is perhaps bad OOP. Firstly it is not obvious from the interface (the method signature) what kind of objects should be accepted. So if another developer wanted to use the method it should be obvious that objects of type X are required without them having to look through the implementation (method body) which is bad encapsulation and breaks the information hiding principle. Secondly because there's no type safety the method can accept any invalid variable which means manual type checking and exception throwing is needed all over the place!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","methods"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13000196,"title":"Method could not be resolved","body":"<p>In my header file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Esame();\nEsame(string);\nEsame(string, Voto);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a c++ tester class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//OK\nEsame esame(\"Algoritmi e strutture dati\", 30);\nesame.stampaEsame();\n\n//OK\nEsame esame2(\"Metodi Avanzati di Programmazione\");\nesame2.setVoto(26);\nesame2.stampaEsame();\n\n//ERROR \nEsame esame3();\nesame3.setVoto(26); //Method could not be resolved\nesame3.stampaEsame(); //Method could not be resolved\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code doesn't compile at all.

Both are intended to minimize hits against a middle-tier or data store:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After fetching “MyRoleProvider” info from a database, it is subsequently stored in the AuthTicket user-data which in turn means that the auth-cookie holds role-info.  Furthermore, in this story, storing and retrieving this role-info is done by a distinct implementation, entirely outside \"MyRoleProvider.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After fetching “MyRoleProvider” info from a database, it is subsequently stored in session and accessed from there.  More precisely, the class “MyRoleProvider” itself will internally access (and update) session when possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Again, both the above stories aim to minimize the latency of hitting an external store by \"caching\" role info.  Both work fine.  The question is, are both design-story choices equally valid?  If not, why?</p>\n\n<h1>The Issue</h1>\n\n<p>There appears to be no \"best practice\" stated anywhere, which says \"your (custom) RoleProvider should always know where role-info is found, whether in session, cache, the database, etc.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Also, there appears to be no (solid) guidance anywhere that explains what kinds of things you should not store in \"<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthenticationticket.userdata.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">userData</a>\" in the authCookie.  What little documentation and guidance there is suggests only two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>'userData' can store additional user information (a vague, broad statement).  I've seen only one code example online, which involved storing additional 3rd party identity/authentication info.</li>\n<li>Do not put too much data in 'userData', because it might make the cookie become too big to be transferred (some browsers limit cookie size).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's it.  From the above guidance, nobody is being expressly told \"it is a best practice to limit the userData only to authentication info.\"  And I certainly have not seen a document which says \"it is a bad idea to put authorization or role-info into 'userData' because...\"</p>\n\n<h1>Deduce a Best Practice?</h1>\n\n<p>My own answer about the two design choices being equal is “no.”  I want to present my argument, and learn from you if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You agree.</li>\n<li>You disagree, because I'm making needless fuss.</li>\n<li>You disagree; although my argument is valid, there are even <em>better</em> arguments of why my thinking ultimately is not right.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully a best-practice concept will emerge as an answer.  Now for my argument(s)...</p>\n\n<h1>My Argument(s)</h1>\n\n<p>I believe the second design-story should be taken, because it represents better modularity: role information is handled completely inside “MyRoleProvider.”  The first option needlessly intermingles authentication (extracting identify from a cookie) and authorization concerns.  Indeed, all the built-in ASP.NET security mechanisms keep these two topics separate; base ASP.NET functionality never stores role-info in the authcookie.  If anyone wants to confirm this, try reflecting these classes: FormsAuthenticationModule, FormsAuthentication, IPrincipal with RolePrincipal implementaion, and IIdentity with FormsIdentity implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The ASP.NET RolePrincipal deserves a particular highlight.  It permits that role-info is indeed stored in a cookie, but it is a second cookie <em>separate from the auth-cookie</em>.  Furthermore, this peculiar idiom still involves consultation with the RoleProvider.  See the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b23yh35t%28v=vs.100%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">example section of this MSDN documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Investigating RolePrincipal further, let's look at RolePrincipal.IsInRole().  Although any such IPrincipal derived class combines identity and role information programmatically, the internal implementation still maintains the RoleProvider as the only source of role information (note the reference to <code>Roles.RoleProviders...</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public bool IsInRole(string role)\n    {\n        if (this._Identity != null)\n        {\n            if (!this._Identity.IsAuthenticated || role == null)\n            {\n                return false;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                role = role.Trim();\n                if (!this.IsRoleListCached)\n                {\n                    this._Roles.Clear();\n                    string[] rolesForUser = Roles.Providers[this._ProviderName].GetRolesForUser(this.Identity.Name);\n                    string[] strArrays = rolesForUser;\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)strArrays.Length; i++)\n                    {\n                        string str = strArrays[i];\n                        if (this._Roles[str] == null)\n                        {\n                            this._Roles.Add(str, string.Empty);\n                        }\n                    }\n                    this._IsRoleListCached = true;\n                    this._CachedListChanged = true;\n                }\n                return this._Roles[role] != null;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new ProviderException(SR.GetString(\"Role_Principal_not_fully_constructed\"));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This kind of ASP.NET “one-stop” deep-assumption of where role information is found, is why role info should be consolidated into the RoleProvider.  In short I claim:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you <em>do</em> store role info in a cookie, the reason why ASP.NET does not have a built-in capability to combine that into the auth-cookie, is precisely because ASP.NET maintains strongly a separation of concerns between the different providers.</li>\n<li>Any RoleProvider should be aware of where role-info might be found, whether in a cookie, session, or otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Conclusion:</h1>\n\n<p>Do not put role-info into the auth-cookie, and ensure your (custom) RoleProvider <em>knows</em> all the places where role info is found, whether the database, a web service, session, cache, or a cookie.</p>\n\n<p>Agree?

I'm not sure how to split up this question, sorry if it's asking too many things. I'm suffering from information overload!</p>\n\n<p>I expect the JS will requests JSON objects from a single PHP file. I'd like a minimal but effective pattern for PHP to respond to requests that is concise and effective. Perhaps the JS would invoke model-like objects which query a database and return JSON to the client. </p>\n\n<p>What would be a good pattern for the PHP side? I've hacked together a PHP file which messily has a large switch statement parsing for instructions from the client, with associated data. A single request could contain multiple instructions. For example, javascript sends a request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\n    url: '/ajax.php', dataType: 'json',\n    data: {instructions: [{\n        instruction: \"newPerson\",\n        data: {\n             name: person.name,\n             email: person.email\n             city: person.city\n        }\n    }]},\n    success: callback, error: ajaxFail\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The callback would be a global handler dealing with any objects the PHP returns, from this request or others. For example, the above might receive a new person object with the person ID generated by PHP inserting into the DB, as well as a city object also with its ID. Other requests might also return those objects, so a single handler makes sense? (One question would be how the javascript associates the returned objects with the insertion submitted)</p>\n\n<p>I'm ashamed by my PHP page code, but it looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$return = array();\n$instructions = $_REQUEST['instructions'];\nforeach ($instructions as $instruction){\n    switch($instruction['instruction']){\n        case 'findPoeple':\n            $data = $instruction['data'];\n            $res = DB::query(\"select player from person where player like '%\". DB::esc($str) .\"%'\");\n            $return['players'] = array();\n            while ($row = DB::fetch($res)){\n                $return['players'][] = $row['player'];\n            }\n        break;\n        case 'loadAllPeople':\n            // similar code\n        break;\n        case 'newPerson':\n            // similar code\n        break;\n        default:\n            die(\"command '$command' not recognised\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\necho json_encode($return);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly there's too much wrong with this to say what to change!

Couple of interesting design pickles","body":"<p>I'm designing a new power-up system for a game I'm creating. It's a side scroller, the power ups appear as circular objects and the player has to touch / move through them to pick up their power. The power up then becomes activated, and deactivates itself a few seconds later. Each power-up has its own duration defined. For simplicity's sake the power ups are spawned (placed on the screen) every X seconds.</p>\n\n<p>I created a PowerUpManager, a singleton whose job is to decide when to create new power ups and then where to place them.</p>\n\n<p>I then created the Powerup base class, and a class that inherits from that base class for every new Powerup. Every Power-up can be in one of three states: Disabled, placed on the screen, and picked up by the player. If the player did not pick up the power up but moved on, the power up will exit the screen and should go back from the placed state to the disabled state, so it can be placed again.</p>\n\n<p>One of the requirements (that I) put in place is that there should be minimal code changes when I code up a new Power up class. The best I could do was one piece of code: The PowerUpManager's constructor, where you must add the new power-up to the to the container that holds all power-ups:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PowerupManager::PowerupManager()\n{\n    available = {\n        new PowerupSpeed(),\n        new PowerupAltWeapon(),\n        ...\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The PowerUpManager, in more details (Question is coming up!):\nHolds a vector of pointers to PowerUp (The base class) called available. This is the initial container that holds one copy of each power up in the game.\nTo handle the different states, it has a couple of lists: One that holds pointers to currently placed power ups, and another list that holds pointers to currently active power ups.\nIt also has a method that gets called every game tick that decides if and where to place a new power up and clean up power ups that weren't picked up. Finally it has a method that gets called when the player runs into a power up, that activates the power up (Moves it from the placed to the active list, and calls the power up's activate method).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once you understand the full picture, the question:\nI needed a way for client code to ask if a particular power-up is currently active. For example: The player has a weapon, but there is a power up that replaces that weapon temporarily. Where I poll for input and recognize that the player wants to fire his weapon, I need to call the correct fire method - The alternative weapon power up fire method, and not the regular weapon fire method.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of this particular demand for a while and came up with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nT* isActivated() // Returns a pointer to the derived Powerup if it exists in the activated list, or nullptr if it doesn't\n{\n    for(Powerup *i : active) // Active is a list of currently active power ups\n    {\n        T *result = dynamic_cast&lt;T*&gt;(i);\n\n        if(result)\n            return result;\n    }\n\n    return nullptr;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So client code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PowerUpAltWeapon *weapon = powerUpManager-&gt;isActivated&lt;PowerUpAltWeapon&gt;();\nif(weapon)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I thought the solution is elegant and kind of neat, but essentially what it is is trying to convert a base type to a derived type. If that doesn't work, you try the next derived type... A long chain of if / else if, it's just disguised in a loop. Does this violate the guideline that I just described? Not casting a base type to all of its derived types in a long chain of if / else if until you get a hit? Is there another solution?</p>\n\n<p>A secondary question is: Is there a way to get rid of the need to construct all the different power ups in the PowerupManager constructor? That is currently the only place you need to make a change if you want to introduce a new power up. If I can get rid of that, that'd be interesting...</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","oop","delphi-7","delphi-xe2","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":138,"score":5,"question_id":12871142,"title":"How can I declare an array property?","body":"<p>I constructed class system</p>\n\n<pre><code>  TTableSpec=class(Tobject)\n  private\n    FName : string;\n    FDescription : string;\n    FCan_add : Boolean;\n    FCan_edit : Boolean;\n    FCan_delete : Boolean;\n    FFields : array[1..100] of TFieldSpec;\n  public\n    property Name: String read FName;\n    property Description: String read FDescription;\n    property Can_add : Boolean read FCan_add;\n    property Can_edit : Boolean read FCan_edit;\n    property Can_delete : Boolean read FCan_delete;\n    property Fields : array read FFields;\n  end;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus in TableSpec Fields property shall be the list of fields (I used TFieldSpec array).

So, I made an abstract class - Node. Any content must have a specific content type. With OO, this is easy - I make a Person class that extends Node, or an Event class that extends Node, etc. Now comes the tricky part - part of my project allows these nodes to be \"included\" in other nodes. That is, if Node A includes Node B, then whenever A is displayed, the data from B is displayed. This means that whenever Node A is instantiated, it needs to instantiate Node B as well. BUT...Node is an abstract class. So, I can't instantiate a raw Node. I have to instantiate one of its implementing classes. So, as far as I can tell, I either need to write an abstract, static function that all extending classes must implement that returns the constructor...OR, I need to use reflection in some way to determine type, and somehow call the appropriate class constructor? </p>\n\n<p>Without regard to Drupal, what is the most appropriate way to handle this issue from a PHP/OO programming standpoint?</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nabstract class Node {\n\n    public $title, $short_summary, $full_summary, $body, $uri, $machine_type_name, $included_content;\n\n    public function __construct($node) {\n\n        ##\n        ## Set simple values\n        $this-&gt;title = $node-&gt;title;\n        $this-&gt;body = $node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'];\n\n        ##\n        ## Set clean uri if aliased\n        if (drupal_lookup_path('alias', 'node/'.$node-&gt;nid)) {\n            $this-&gt;uri = '/'.drupal_lookup_path('alias', 'node/'.$node-&gt;nid);\n        } else {\n            $this-&gt;uri = '/node/'.$node-&gt;nid;\n        }\n\n        ##\n        ## Set short summary if exists, else short form of body text\n        if(strlen($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_summary'])) {\n            $this-&gt;short_summary = $node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_summary'];\n        } else {\n            $this-&gt;short_summary = text_summary($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'], NULL, 100);\n        }\n\n        ##\n        ## Set full summary to concatenation of body\n        $this-&gt;full_summary = text_summary($node-&gt;body['und'][0]['safe_value'], NULL, 600);\n\n        ##\n        ## Add included content if module is enabled\n        if (module_exists('content_inclusion')) {\n            // is this possible?

I would also like to perform this exact same task on other classes as well.  The obvious solution is to write a function in a separate M file that all the classes call in order to perform this task.  However, that seems impossible in Matlab (see below).  Is there another way to accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the problem specifically: suppose I have one m file with the contents</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef PrivateTest\n    properties (Access=private)\n        a\n    end\n\n    methods\n        function this = directWrite(this, v)\n            this.a = v;\n        end\n        function this = sameFileWrite(this, v)\n            this = writePrivate(this, v);\n        end\n        function this = otherFileWrite(this, v)\n            this = otherFileWritePrivate(this, v);\n        end\n        function print(this)\n            disp(this.a);\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction this = writePrivate(this, v)\n    this.a = v;\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and another m file with the contents</p>\n\n<pre><code>function this = otherFileWritePrivate(this, v)\n    this.a = v;\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After instantiating <code>p = PrivateTest</code>, both of these commands work fine (as expected):</p>\n\n<pre><code>p = p.directWrite(1);\np = p.sameFileWrite(2);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but this command doesn't work even though it's the same code, just in a different m file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p = p.otherFileWrite(3);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it seems like any code that performs operations on private properties of a class MUST be in the same m file as the classdef that defines those private properties.  Another possibility might be to have all the classes inherit a class with the writing method, but Matlab doesn't allow this either.  In one m file, I would have this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef WriteableA\n    methods\n        function this = inheritWrite(this, v)\n            this.a = v;\n        end\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and in another m file I would have this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>classdef PrivateTestInherit &lt; WriteableA\n    properties (Access=private)\n        a\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, after instantiating <code>p = PrivateTestInherit;</code>, the command <code>p.inheritWrite(4)</code> causes the same error message as before: \"Setting the 'a' property of the 'PrivateTestInherit' class is not allowed.\"</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, How is it possible to generalize code that manipulates private properties in Matlab, or is it possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12826126,"title":"How to call a non-static method from another class","body":"<p>This's my second question, even thought, i answered the previous one, on my own.

It seems the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow\">Command Pattern</a> fits the use nicely, but I am unsure how to best implement it.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand the pattern, it is necessary to include in each command:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The details of the paint operation for purposes of redo (e.g. Line -> start &amp; end points, free form line -> <code>GeneralPath</code>)</li>\n<li>The state of the component prior to the change for undo.  In this case, that will be a small snapshot image of the area affected by the command.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My understanding based on that is that each command needs to be 'atomic' or self contained, with all the information needed for undo/redo that operation.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately that would require storing more information than I'd first anticipated.  For a line we must also account for things like the <code>Color</code>, <code>Stroke</code> and <code>RenderingHints</code> used to draw it initially.  This turns my 'simple little commands' into something ..more bulky in memory, and with more boiler-plate code to churn out (each will be a serializable bean<sup>1</sup>).</p>\n\n<p>For reasons of memory conservation (mostly) I was wanting to 'cheat' on the specification of the commands.  Perhaps take a backup of the entire drawing area every 100th update, but otherwise store no part of the changed image, and simply rebuild the last (up to) 100 commands for each new paint operation.  But that seems problematic to ensure that the state of the <code>Graphics</code> object is right before painting each part - this part might require a line, but the <code>RenderingHints</code> were changed 4 commands ago, the <code>Color</code> was changed 98 commands ago, while the <code>Stroke</code> has remained the same for the last 227 commands.</p>\n\n<p>Pursuing a more memory efficient command seems to throw the pattern right out the window in terms of being 'atomic'.  That in turn leads to difficulties in determining the earliest command that might affect the rendering.</p>\n\n<p>Should I:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Look for a new pattern?</li>\n<li>Attempt to implement my peculiar needs by tweaking the pattern?</li>\n<li>Toss all this in the waste bin as premature optimization and code it in the simplest (and most memory consuming) way that sticks to the command pattern as defined?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>\"each will be a serializable bean\"</em>  On 2nd thoughts, no.  I did dome checks to find that a <code>Graphics2D</code> (which neatly encapsulates many parameters used when drawing) is not serializable.  Further, a <code>BasicStroke</code> <strong>is</strong> serializable, but the thickness of the stroke is not stored.  I could create serializable versions of many of the attributes but it seems to make for a lot more code, so I'm going to abandon that spec. as well.  I will only attempt to store a reference to the <code>Graphics2D</code> at run-time.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","oop","class"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":1,"question_id":12789319,"title":"Java: Structure a users control system using OOP","body":"<p>I hope I can explain.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a problem, just I want to know how to build my users system control and I want to know if my idea is correct:</p>\n\n<p>My idea:</p>\n\n<p>*One class (file 1) to functions, methods and operations</p>\n\n<p>*Other class (file 2) to swing elements, buttons, textbox, etc.</p>\n\n<p>*But I don't know how connect these two classes. </p>\n\n<p>For example:: I have 2 textbox (user, password) and one button, then when press the button, send data of each textbox(file 2) to a function (file 1) and process.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any other choice, I'd read it.\nThank you in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","codeigniter-2","codeigniter-datamapper"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":12788979,"title":"Error in CodeIgniter Datamapper when saving relationship","body":"<p>I’m getting a really strange error.</p>\n\n<p>I have consultants and companies in a database.

This problem is partially solved, if your classes have the suitable names. Also you can break the design patterned class structure you implement, if you're missing some rules writing your code by chance or you're not so experienced in the design patterns. The compilers can protect you and help you to implement the interfaces - if you're not implementing interface, you can't compile your application. It's a good and safe approach. And if the compilers could protect you when you implement design patterns classes too? Look, a lot of programming languages supports \"foreach\" statement. And if the programming languages could provide support for the factories, bridges, proxies, mementos, etc?

No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.</p>\n\n<p>The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the <code>UserManager</code>'s job was allocating and freeing users from the Heap it would not manage the users but to guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a <code>UserSheperd</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe the <code>UserManager</code>'s job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a <code>UserRecordsClerk</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it.  And find this simple idea amazingly hard.</p>\n\n<p>I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly <strong>one</strong> thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, for example with a factory)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)</li>\n<li>Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects their creation and shutdown</li>\n<li>Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)</li>\n<li><p>Nanny - Helps objects reach \"usable\" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects</p></li>\n<li><p>etc etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things in the way as I describe as not-so-important or wrong?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing that issue.

However, I got stuck already.</p>\n\n<p>This is the code I have at the moment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function($, window, undefined) {\n    var Form = function($el) {\n        this.$el = $el;\n        this.fields = {};\n\n        this.prototype.validate = function() {\n            this.getFields();    \n        }\n\n        this.prototype.getFields = function() {\n            console.log(\"getting fields\");\n        }\n\n        return {\n            validate: this.validate\n        }\n    };\n\n    window.Form = Form;\n})(jQuery, window);\n\n\n$(function() {\n\n    var form = new Form('#form-newsletter');\n    form.validate();\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A couple of questions about this.</p>\n\n<p>I wrapped the Form variable in a self-executing function, passing in three parameters. jQuery, window and undefined to make sure it's always undefined. I'm not going to lie, this is how I learnt to do it and I'm not 100% sure why I do it this way. Is this bad practice or could I improve on this somehow? I then expose the Form variable by attaching it to the window.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the <code>Form</code> var, I set some properties (is that how we call them?) and I have a couple of methods. I expose only the validate method in the return statement. Is this okay?</p>\n\n<p>And then the part where I got stuck. I want <code>validate()</code> to be like an initialize function, which has the task of validating the form. Validate should call the getFields function to parse the form fields and put them into the fields object. However, I can't seem to get that working. It doesn't work when I call <code>this.getFields()</code>, <code>this.prototype.getFields()</code> or <code>Form.getFields</code>. Is this because the <code>this</code> inside this function is a different this than the Form object (correct wording here?)?. Should I put something like <code>this.self = this</code> at the start of the Form function?</p>\n\n<p>I'm also wondering if it's okay to attach those methods to the prototype. Is there a reason not to do this? </p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to learn; most books I read about JavaScript focus on the basics: a <code>Dog</code> class which inherits from a <code>Mammal</code> class. However, they don't really help me out with stuff like this, as far as I can tell. Are there any books, tutorials, screencasts out there to help me understand these concepts better?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Say I want to group my scripts under a common namespace: I could do</p>\n\n<pre><code>var MyStuff = {};\n\nMyStuff.Utilities = { // stuff };\nMyStuff.Form = function() { // stuff };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if I want to put these into separate files, like <code>mystuff-form.js</code>, <code>mystuff-utilities.js</code>, how would I go about it? Where do I declare the namespace var <code>var MyStuff = {}</code>? And after I do that, I can just attach my Form and Utilities to that, right? I can hardly make a <code>MyStuff.js</code> file with just <code>var MyStuff = {}; window.MyStuff = MyStuff</code> in it, can I?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","oop","nhibernate"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":0,"question_id":12714021,"title":"Casting from derived type to base type","body":"<p>Given that</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractOrder\n{\n    //some properties...\n}\n\npublic class AnonymousOrder:AbstractOrder\n{\n    //some properties...\n}\n\n\npublic class PartnerOrder:AbstractOrder\n    {\n        //some properties...\n    }\n\n\npublic AbstractOrder FindOrderByConfirmationNumber(string confirmationNumber)\n{\n    ICriteria criteria =\n        Session.CreateCriteria(typeof(AbstractOrder))\n            .SetMaxResults(10)\n            .AddOrder(Order.Desc(\"PurchasedDate\"))\n            .Add(Restrictions.Eq(\"ConfirmationNumber\", confirmationNumber));\n    var l = criteria.List&lt;AbstractOrder&gt;();\n    AbstractOrder ao = l[0] as AbstractOrder;\n    return ao as AbstractOrder;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can someone please explain why</p>\n\n<pre><code>PartnerOrder order = repo.FindOrderByConfirmationNumber(confirmationNumber)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns a type of AnonymousOrder and how I get it to return a type of PartnerOrder?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop","design-patterns","anti-patterns"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12739990,"title":"Is accessing child class from parent class considered anti-pattern","body":"<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class Foo\n{\n    public Bar f1()\n    {\n        return new Bar();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Bar extends Foo\n{\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the design point of view, do you agree this design is anti-pattern?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","css","html5","oop","bug"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":103,"score":0,"question_id":12450648,"title":"a:hover style sticking on iOS browser","body":"<p>I recently released my first open-source project called Shutter Image Gallery and when I was checking to see how it looked on mobile devices (iOS) and noticed a problem that I cannot seem to fix...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1SYSX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the image, the a:hover state on the control buttons seem to stick.

If so, do you have any recommendations for alternate solutions? Preferably ones that allow me to continue using Persons and Trusts transparently as Owners and Payors?</p>\n\n<p>Part of my concern comes from less-familiar developers confusing a Person for an Owner like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Application app = new Application();\nPerson timmy = new Person();\nOwner smithFamilyTrust = new Trust();\nPayor steve = new Person();\n\napp.setInsured(timmy);\napp.setOwner(smithFamilyTrust);\napp.setPayor(steve);\n\n...\n\n//this would run, but would be wrong\nif(timmy instanceof Owner){\n   //Do Owner Stuff.\n}\n\n//this would run, and be correct\nOwner owner = app.getOwner();\n//Do Owner Stuff\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Edit to clarify \"Owner Stuff\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point, \"owner stuff\" is simple. Things like getting/setting the owner's id, PIN, or Address:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//I want this\napp.getOwner().getId();\napp.getOwner().getPIN();\napp.getOwner().getAddress();\n\n//I don't want this\nif(app.getOwner() instanceof Person){\n    Person owner = app.getOwner();\n    owner.getId();\n    owner.getPIN();\n    owner.getAddress();\n} else if(app.getOwner() instanceof Trust){\n    Trust owner = app.getOwner();\n    owner.getId();\n    owner.getPIN();\n    owner.getAddress();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Initially I thought I should go with some sort of Entity superclass and have Person and Trust extend that class, but they store and retrieve IDs and PINs differently. The different implementation of the same behavior led me to interfaces. </p>\n\n<p>I could still go with an Entity superclass, but I feel like I can't accurately represent a \"generic\" ID or PIN for that Entity class. I'd have to implement either Person's ID and PIN logic or Trust's ID and PIN logic, then override that in the other class. That feels wrong to me. I suppose Entity could be an abstract class that Person and Trust extend, but I'm not sure that's better than using an interface.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","static","singleton","phpunit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":82,"score":1,"question_id":12719393,"title":"PHP Static Methods/Singleton Pattern","body":"<p>I am designing a new architecture for my company's software product.

The situation is that when sending the mails in response to some input, they should be grouped so a user doesn't receive several consecutive mails with different items but just one with all items included. Also, mails should be grouped by a specific type, that depends on the type of input that created the mail notification, I have the list of inputs, and each one with its specific grouping type, for instance:</p>\n\n<p>Hierarchy: <strong>Employee</strong> has <strong>Processes</strong> has <strong>Requests</strong> has <strong>Activities</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 1:</strong> <em>By Employee</em> (so a receiver will get all notifications of the processes he owns of this activity type in just one mail)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> <em>By Process</em> (a receiver will get a group of all notifications of all requests on this process, and this activity type)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 3:</strong> <em>By Request</em> (activities of this request will be grouped)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity 4:</strong> <em>By Activity</em> (each activity will be sent in a separate mail)</p>\n\n<p>This groupings will change constantly.</p>\n\n<p>You may think, well in order to do that inputs should be made at once so mails are generated at the same time and so grouped, otherwise how the system will know when to wait for other inputs and when to just send a separate mail?.. well the answer is both, so what I'm doing is setting a timer so the mail service runs every 5 minutes, some immediate mails might get delayed a few minutes, but that's an affordable trade off.</p>\n\n<p>So I chose to use this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/9194922/920359\">Chain of Responsability Design Pattern</a> and here's the structure:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U8zP4.png\" alt=\"MailGroupingStructure\"></p>\n\n<p>So I have two interfaces <strong>IGroupingType</strong> which defines how each type should be, and has 2 methods: <code>CalculateGrouping()</code>: determines if this is the grouping of the activity. <code>GroupEmailsToSend()</code>: if this is the grouping, gets the mails list.</p>\n\n<p>Interface <strong>IGroupingHandler</strong> is the service class that will call each grouping type, the <code>GetGroupingResult()</code> just calls the 2 methods on the <strong>IGroupingType</strong> concrete implemetations, first <code>CalculateGrouping()</code> to get the correct grouping, when it finds it, calls the <code>GroupEmailsToSend()</code>. This interface also registers the <strong>next</strong> node in the chain for each grouping.</p>\n\n<p>The grouping Enum is just for returning the result of grouping calculations.</p>\n\n<p>And then there's also the <strong>EndOfChainSendingGrouping</strong> class, in case no grouping was found I'll just send the mail right away.</p>\n\n<p>Basicaly I just need some advice on this structure, since I'm kind of new to this pattern, does it have any pitfalls? is there something I can improve? or is there a better way to accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance..</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","oop","design-patterns","delphi-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":4,"question_id":12476023,"title":"Can I implement change tracking on a classes that derive from a wsdl imported classes in Delphi 2010?","body":"<p>Is there a way to implement change tracking in a derived class without overriding the getters and setters of the base class?<br/>\nI have an entity framework based multi-tier project in development with the data access and business logic eventually moving to C# based server application.

And those are very similar, except that methods that do things with fruits only call the methods that do things with fruits, and the same thing for vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>I want to refactor this to reduce the duplication, but I'm not sure what is the best way to accomplish that.

Having said that, those similar methods I refer to cannot be inside the \"Plants\" classes, and they usually have another argument, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void createSomethingUsingFruit(Something s, Fruit f);\npublic void createSomethingUsingVegetable(Something s, Vegetable v);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Namely, those methods have other concerns besides Fruits/Vegetables, and aren't really appropriated to be in any Fruit/Vegetable class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Most code in those methods only reads state from the Fruit/Vegetable objects, and create instances of other classes according to the appropriate type, store in the database and so on -- <em>from my answer to a question in the comments that I think it's important</em>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","oop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12695195,"title":"JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)","body":"<p>After searching and reading about how to writing Object Oriented JavaScript, I summarized them in  the below code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/********************************************************/\n// Enumeration.\nvar Fruits = {\n    Apple: 0,\n    Orange: 1,\n    Watermelon: 2,\n    Banana: 3\n};

Before entering, we can all see what the magician looks like (the properties) and what tricks he (it’s mostly a “he”) can perform (the methods), and on what types of stuff he can make his magic tricks (type declaration). Thus from this “public” poster (the header file) of the magician, I can understand what kind of magic he can perform and what props he is using. Maybe there is also a mentioning of that this particular magician has learned some of his tricks from the great Houdini (the class heritage and Houdini thus being the superclass).</p>\n\n<p>If I were allowed backstage, I would then be able to actually see how he is doing his tricks, that  is, I would be able to look in the magicians implementation file.</p>\n\n<p>Would this metaphor be somewhat along the lines of how you can understand the concept of a custom class?</p>\n\n<p>However, I have not yet quite figured out how the concept of class methods and instance methods relates to this metaphor?</p>\n\n<p>Could you say that instance methods belongs to a category of tricks that this particular “instance” of the magician is performing in this particular show, and the class methods would be the tricks that contemporary magicians can perform?\nThirdly, it is a bit confusing the way methods are using “types”. Some seem to be declared up front in the interface file, and some seem to just be “declared” on the fly within the methods?</p>\n\n<p>To take an example using the “Magician” class, my understanding of the header file might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface Magician : NSHoudini\n\n// Instance method that given a variable of type rat it will turn this into something of type rabit \n\n-   (rabit) FromRatToRabit: (rat) aRat;\n\n@end \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the implementation file might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import “Magician.h”\n\n@implementation Magician\n\nrabit aRabit \n// rabit being the type and aRabit the variable\n\n\n-   (rabit) FromRatToRabit:(rat)aRat;\n{\n\n// some magic code goes here which will take what’s in the aRat variable, of type rat\n// and turn it into a form of type rabit and return it in the aRabit variable \n\naRabit\n}\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If above is correct I wonder why the aRat variable that you “feed” the method with is not declared? Or is the declaration considered done when you are using it in the method description?</p>\n"},{"tags":["design","design-patterns","oop"],"answer_count":13,"favorite_count":22,"up_vote_count":28,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9131,"score":28,"question_id":85272,"title":"How do you know when to use design patterns?","body":"<p>Anyone can read the GoF book to learn what design patterns are and how to use them, but what is the process for figuring out when a design pattern solves a problem?

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class customer_controller(coffee_shop_controller):\n\n    \"\"\"creates a controller to add/delete/amend customer records in the\n       coffee shop database\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def add_customer(self,fn,ln,sa,t,pc,tn):\n        sql = \"\"\"insert into customer\n                 (first_name,last_name,street_address,town,post_code,telephone_number)\n                 values\n                 ('{0}','{1}','{2}','{3}','{4}','{5}')\"\"\".format(fn,ln,sa,t,pc,tn)\n        self.cursor.execute(sql)\n        self.db.commit()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I appreciate that the design pattern may not be great (open to suggestions) and that I really should be preventing SQL injection but the closing the connection is interesting me at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>From searching around the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/sqlite3.html?highlight=sqlite3#sqlite3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python docs</a> the comment line suggests that we <strong><em>can</em></strong> close the connection, not that we <strong><em>must</em></strong>. Is this right? Do I not really need to bother?</p>\n\n<p>If I do need to bother then there seems to be a split on what I should do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manually close the connection</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/06/12/safely-using-destructors-in-python/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Use the <code>__del__</code> method</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/974813/cleaning-up-an-internal-pysqlite-connection-on-object-destruction\">Use <code>with</code> or <code>atexit</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there anything definitive here? The <code>__del__</code> method makes the most sense to me but maybe that's my ignorance talking.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.</p>\n\n<p>Adam.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","heredoc"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":12679198,"title":"using static::member->method inside HEREDOC [PHP]","body":"<pre><code>    static public function toolBar()\n{\n    var_dump(static::$_lang);\n    var_dump(static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Index'));\n    return &lt;&lt;&lt; EOC\n    &lt;a href=\"index.php\"&gt;{${static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Index')}}&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;\n    &lt;a href=\"?view=login\"&gt;{${static::$_lang-&gt;getVal('Login')}}&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;     \nEOC;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Expression {${static::$_lang->getVal('Index')}} return nothing\ninstead of the string</p>\n\n<p>There is any workaround for this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":145,"score":-1,"question_id":8093220,"title":"What is the best way to start this program?","body":"<p>Write a program in Java which can do the following:\n“Hardwired” into the program:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Information about the company’s products: a product code, description, and unit price.

It involves iterating over memory addresses while encapsulating the actual implementation:</p>\n\n<p>We have an object that is a data container. It is created by allocating large chunks of memory and indexing the atomic elements in a way we've devised.</p>\n\n<p>This container is being developed as a replacement for an inefficient pointer-based object. As a result, this new object (at least in the initial stages of integration) must conform to the old interface of providing pointers or at least acting like it does.</p>\n\n<p>One specific problem I've started having doubts about is the sequential access of the elements in order. I'm attempting to turn the container into a \"black box\" to discourage the bad practices that developed as a result of the old model freely handing out modifiable raw pointers. For this reason, I've written a simple templatized \"for_each\" function that accepts a Functor that will execute on each element.</p>\n\n<p>This was all fine and dandy until I noticed some of the complex operations that were required for some functions.

I am a CS undergrad who has have been using Java for 3 years, and I still find it difficult to comprehend how to include the Main function into my design. It feels wrong to place it in a class all on its own, but it also feels wrong to insert it into another class file. I see the latter as such because it doesn't fit in with the rest of the class making it incohesive. I can't just stick a main function on my DocumentReader object, for example. It would have nothing to do with the object. On the other hand, I can't just make a Main class that only has a main function inside it because in object-oriented programming, you're supposed to think in terms of objects effectively creating a miniature world in your head. For that miniature world to revolve around a single object that does nothing but exist just seems off. It doesn't act as a narrator and character in a story because it does nothing, at the same time. I prefer C's style of having a Main function that is separate from everything. It keeps the narrative of the story separate from the characters that are interacting with one another.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know how the professionals mix the main method into the rest of their code.

It might be extremely rare that it is purely based on \"concrete object\" inheritance?  If there are such usage, what might be the situation that a Javascript purely uses \"concrete objects\" and have no \"generic objects\"?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I ask this question because Prototypal Inheritance typically is said to be \"classless\" and object-based.  But it also seems that we'd create  generic objects first, for the concrete objects to be based on, so this \"generic object\", in a way, also feel like a \"class\".  That is, even if we don't write code to make Javascript's inheritance to become a classical inheritance structure (class-based), and purely just use prototypal inheritance (object-based), we would still more often than not, use \"generic objects\" which do look like classes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: if we see a class as a \"blueprint\" of how an object is constructed, in classical OOP, then this generic object method also involves blueprints for objects, but just that it is more dynamic and not static like Objective-C.  For example, we can dynamically add a property to <code>KartDriver</code> object and now all Yoshis and Marios will inherit from it.  So looking at this blueprint design, it in fact is \"class\" and not \"classless\".  Just that this is dynamic class, while the classical OOP is static class.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":12666671,"title":"Accessing a single object from an array of objects that is in another class","body":"<p>Okay so I have a driver class called MonthlyReport that reads in data from 2 different .dat files, one has information regarding accounts and another has information regarding customers.

These files contain many functions\n\nfunction myErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline, $errcontext){\n    // some code to handle errors here\n\n}\n\nclass myObject {\n    function __construct() {\n        // set the values here\n    }\n\n    function computeSomething() {\n        ...\n        doFunction2();\n        ...\n    }\n\n    function SomethingBadHappened()\n    {\n    }\n}\n\nfunction doFunction1() {\n    // for some reason, an error happens here\n    // it is properly handled by the current error handler\n}\n\nfunction doFunction2() {\n    // for some reason, an error happens here\n    // since it got called by $obj, I want the error handler to run $obj-&gt;SomethingBadHappened();\n    // but $obj is not known in myErrorHandler function!\n}\n\nset_error_handler('myErrorHandler');\n\n// some procedural code here\ndoFunction1();\ndoAnotherThing();\n\n// then I use objects\n$obj = new myObject();\n$obj-&gt;run();\n\n// then I may use procedural code again\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My custom error handler is <strong>already</strong> working fine. It catches and processes all PHP errors that occur in the code executed after the error handler is set.</p>\n\n<h2>My problem:</h2>\n\n<p>If an error occurs within a method of <code>myObject</code> class, I would like to call a non-static method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$obj-&gt;SomethingBadHappened();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>$obj</code> is not in the scope of <code>myErrorHandler</code>. How can I access <code>$obj</code> inside the error handler to call a member function of <code>$obj</code>?<br>\nI currently have 300KB of PHP code, and I can't change the signature of all the functions to add <code>$obj</code> as a parameter (there are too many functions!).</p>\n\n<p>I read that it is possible to define the custom error handler as a method of an object. But, if I do that, it won't be able to catch errors that happen before creating the instance of <code>myObject</code> ($obj).</p>\n\n<p>I also read about exceptions, but it doesn't seem to help solving my problem.\nI am not willing to use global variables.

All classes have to share some indexing features, but also all of them define a lot of properties. The properties are defined on class level with descriptors, to be able to intercept writing to them for validation and check for duplicates in the DB. For this, every class has a list of the automatically maintained properties, <code>_properties</code>. They also hold <code>_indices</code> and some other features, which I don't want to copy on my own to every single Element-class (about 10 or so). </p>\n\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BaseElement(object):\n    _properties = None\n\nclass ElementFlavour1(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n....\n\nclass ElementFlavourN(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'e', 'f', 'g'\n\nfor item in locals():\n    if issubclass(item, BaseElement):\n        item._v_properties_set = set(item._properties) if item._properties else set()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it basically does what it should do: I need to iterate the <code>_properties</code> linearly, but I also want to do quick lookups, if some property is present in a class. Nevertheless, I don't want to repeat myself and specify this set for every single flavour of <code>BaseElement</code> explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>The current solution works, but I consider it as an ugly hack and would like to get rid of it. E.g. subclasses of <code>BaseElement</code> in other modules wouldn't get their properties set right. Playing around with <code>__new__</code> also seems to be the wrong way, as it doesn't intercept the class construction, but the instantiation. So, how to do that properly?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I'm aware of OrderedDict, but this is not what I'm looking for. I'd like to hook into the class creation process in a clean way and append arbitrary functionality there.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","oop","inheritance"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":113,"score":1,"question_id":8509421,"title":"OOP and inheritance advice needed","body":"<p>Note there's a lot of code posted below but its mostly all the same, that's what i'm looking for advice on :)</p>\n\n<p>Just getting to grips with OOP and inheritance, i'm making an android pong clone, and <strong>i'm trying to separate out a bunch of duplicate code found in my \"paddle\" and \"bomb\" classes into a separate class called sprite.

I have a library containing several objects and it is expanding quickly.  I always try to think in terms of re-useability and break my projects down into small, reusable, and loosely coupled components so that I am not only creating the project but I am also creating the parts for future projects.  I am trying to design a sort of package management system so that I can stop using the absolute paths within include statements for objects.  I would like to have a single file containing includes to every class file within my library.  Along with the includes, I want to add a class with a \"singleton\" pattern that will allow me to grab instances of every object that I have in the library on demand.  I plan to create a static getter for each object that returns a reference to a new instance.  Basically, something like this...</p>\n\n<pre><code>include('classa.php');\ninclude('classb.php');\ninclude('classc.php');\nclass pacman{\n     private static $instance_stack;\n     public static function GetPackage($strPackage){\n         if(!self::$instance_stack){\n             self::$instance_stack['classa']=new ClassA();\n             self::$instance_stack['classb']=new ClassB();\n             self::$instance_stack['classc']=new ClassC();\n         }\n         if(array_key_exists(strtolower($strPackage),self::$instance_stack)){\n             return self::$instance_stack[strtolower($strPackage)];\n         }\n         else{\n             return false;\n         }\n     }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then if I want to get class a...</p>\n\n<pre><code>include('pacman.php');\n$ClassA = pacman::GetPackage('classa');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I realize that this is a very rudimentary implementation.  My example just covers the bare minimum.  My problem isn't implementing this; rather, it is a question of whether or not hundreds of uninstantiated classes from the includes will have a noticeable effect on performance.

This sounds like a usual case for the strategy pattern. Thus I created an interface which defines the <code>render-function</code> and gave the the <code>camera</code> class a <code>pointer</code> to this interface.\nThe problem is that the <code>render function</code> needs access to all the data in the <code>camera</code> class and therefore I gave this function a pointer to the <code>camera</code> class as a parameter. It looks like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"ICameraRender.h\"\n\nclass Camera{\nprivate:\n    ICameraRender*      _cameraRender;\n\npublic:\n    Camera();\n    Camera(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n    ~Camera();\n\n    void renderCamera(){  _cameraRender-&gt;render(this); }\n\n\n    void setCameraRender(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n        /..../\n\n};\n\n\nclass ICameraRender{\npublic:\n    virtual ~ICameraRender(){\n\n    }\n\n    //Override me\n    virtual void render(Camera* camera) = 0;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to be an elegant solution due to the liability to an infity loop (calling <code>camera-&gt;renderCamera()</code> in the <code>render-function</code> in <code>ICameraRender</code>).

Since the function which operates on the camera's data, only needs access to the data I thought I could split up the camera class itself. A class called Camera and CameraModel. The last one holds all the needed data and the first one does operations on it. \nTherefore I just have to pass a pointer to CameraModel to my function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CameraModel{\nprivate:\n    /...data.../\npublic:\n   /...setter and getter.../\n};\n\nclass Camera{\nprivate: \n    CameraModel*   _cameraModel;\n    ICameraRender* _cameraRender;\n\npublic:\nCamera();\n    Camera(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n    ~Camera();\n\n    void renderCamera(){  _cameraRender-&gt;render(_cameraModel); }\n\n    void setCameraRender(ICameraRender&amp; cameraRender);\n        /..../\n};\n\nclass ICameraRender{\npublic:\n    virtual ~ICameraRender(){\n\n    }\n\n    //Override me\n    virtual void render(CameraModel* cameraModel) = 0;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the render-function (which only calculates new values for the camera according to user input) does no longer have access to the renderCamera-function.\nWhat do you think about this solution? </p>\n\n<p>Regards Stan</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","oop","nsobject"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":95,"score":-1,"question_id":12637983,"title":"how to pass values between Objective C classes(NSObject type)","body":"<p>How to pass values/objects between different NSObject classes in IOS Applications?..</p>\n\n<p>I have a class A, with following ivars- </p>\n\n<pre><code>NSString *streetAddress; \n\nNSString *city;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Class B, i want to assign values to the variables declared in Class A.</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSArray *address = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects: @\"Hosur Road\", @\"Bangalore\", nil];\n\nstreetAddress = [address objectAtIndex: 0];\n\ncity = [address objectAtIndex: 1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would create error... so how to assign in case both CLASS A &amp; B are NSObject classes.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!\n(Though this is a beginner question do answer it!)</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","oop","recursion","ember.js"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12643872,"title":"Call Recursive Method from within jQuery Ajax Function (Ember)","body":"<p>I have an object which loads data using a .getJSON jQuery method, from within this function (excerpted from the object):</p>\n\n<pre><code>getResults: function () { \n    var me = this;\n    $.getJSON(me.url, function (d) {\n        me.set(\"url\", d.pagination.next_url);\n        $.each(d.data, function (k, v) { me.results.insertAt(0, v); });\n        if (me.get(\"url\")) { me.getResults(); }\n    });\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works until the \"me.getResults()\" method is called (it definitely gets past the me.get(\"url\") call, checked that).

My thinking was that because these lower level controllers were still interacting with the view, that they should remain controllers rather than models or drivers.</p>\n\n<p>What I found, however, is that each instance of a controller also spawns a new instance of CI.  So I would have 3 or 4 instances of CI running for each request.  Ton of overhead, and also caused session issues.</p>\n\n<p>I have since moved these lower level controllers into the library as drivers.  They now capture the CI instance in the construct method, and make modifications to it.  This makes it VERY nice to work with, and doesn't require the HMVC extension.  The drivers are not externally callable either, so it allows me to funnel all requests through specific entry points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is whether this is structurally correct.</strong>  I have always held the notion that drivers should only modify the data they are provided through their method calls, but many of these drivers will pull information directly from GET and POST, and while they will not directly append to the View, they are often accessing view files, and passing the processed view to the CI instance for output.</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] <em>A little more context:</em>\nOne of the drivers I have created is essentially a user login driver called 'Access'.  It makes calls to the 'User' model for create/login/logout methods.  The driver uses the POST data to check the User model, then loads the correct view with errors and whatever is needed.  The idea, being, with 2 lines, I can include this driver in any controller throughout the project, so there is a significant decrease in code redundancy.  Again, I know that the drivers should be confined to their scope, however the driver does not modify anything outside it's scope, but simply returns the view it has created.</p>\n\n<p>Is there another method to for doing this that is more inline with straight MVC?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","oop","class","gcc","information-hiding"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":138,"score":4,"question_id":12641358,"title":"Private functions of a class accessible?","body":"<p>I have been trying to learn C++ for some time now.

The same can be said for delete and search. </p>\n\n<pre>\n    hashTable[string1] = \"\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; hashTable[string1] &lt;&lt; endl;\n</pre>\n\n<p>My major problem is that I do not know how to overload the <code>[]</code> operator to gain this functionality.

If you have code that relies on the concrete component’s type, decorators will break that code.

My company recently updated their servers to 10 and we intend on leveraging the new features and functionality.</p>\n\n<p>My question is based off of something that was glossed over in the book and is leading me to confusing and conflicting answers when I throw searches at Google.  My understanding of ORM development in CF8 (using an ORM framework like Transfer, as well as book examples and other readings) places attributes for your bean in the variables.instance scope to insulate the object attributes from application attributes that are meant to exist in the variables scope.  But using the baked-in ORM in CF9 does not use the instance scope; it instead places the object and application attributes together in the variables scope.  For me, this throws of my methodology of development, since I tend to create a function in a lot of my objects that returns all object attributes at once (handy for the initialization of the object, display all of the attributes for the object, and creating a new record from an empty instance instead of manually calling all of my setters or getters individually). </p>\n\n<p>I need an explanation as to why this was done in this manner; to me it doesn't make sense.  Are there other functions that exist within the baked-in ORM that replicate my all-attributes functionality that I'm missing or haven't run into yet?  I've read that there are potential conflicts between this attribute naming process and other variables you may create in functions that aren't stemmed off by var scoping; I don't know if that stuff was resolved in 10 or if it's just nonsense.

The following is an example of a chess game that I wish to design in an OO manner. This is a very broad design and my focus at this stage is just to identify who is responsible for what messages and how the objects interact each other to simulate the game. Please point out if there are elements of bad design (high coupling, bad cohesion etc.) and how to improve on them. </p>\n\n<p>The Chess game has the following classes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Board</li>\n<li>Player</li>\n<li>Piece</li>\n<li>Square</li>\n<li>ChessGame</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Board is made up of squares and so Board can be made responsible for creating and managing Square objects. Each piece also is on a square so each piece also has a reference to the square it is on. (Does this make sense?). Each piece then is responsible to move itself from one square to another.\nPlayer class holds references to all pieces he owns and is also responsible for their creation (Should player create Pieces?) . Player has a method takeTurn which in turn calls a method movePiece which belongs to the piece Class which changes the location of the piece from its current location to another location. Now I am confused on what exactly the Board class must be responsible for. I assumed it was needed to determine the current state of the game and know when the game is over. But when a piece changes it's location how should the board get updated? should it maintain a seperate array of squares on which pieces exist and that gets updates as pieces move? </p>\n\n<p>Also, ChessGame intially creates the Board and player objects who in turn create squares and pieces respectively and start the simulation. Briefly, this might be what the code in ChessGame may look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>Player p1 =new Player();\nPlayer p2 = new Player();\n\nBoard b = new Board();\n\nwhile(b.isGameOver())\n{\n  p1.takeTurn(); // calls movePiece on the Piece object\n  p2.takeTurn();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am unclear on how the state of the board will get updated. Should piece have a reference to board? Where should be the responsibility lie? Who holds what references? Please help me with your inputs and point out problems in this design. I am deliberately not focusing on any algorithms or further details of game play as I am only interested in the design aspect.

Or is \"only providing database access, though for a number of different consumers\" a single responsibility?</p>\n\n<p>To maybe make that a bit clearer, here's roughly what the relevant classes would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DatabaseConnection\n    protected m_webservice\n    public OftenUsedDatabaseAccess()\n\nApplicationDatabaseConnection : DatabaseConnection, IConnectorA, IConnectorB\n    public IConnectorA.RetrieveRecords(fieldValue)\n    public IConnectorB.WriteStuff(listOfStuff)\n\nFunctionAController\n    private m_IConnectorA\n\nFunctionBController\n    private m_IConnectorB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The alternatives I can think of don't really seem ideal to me either.</p>\n\n<p>To split up the database access functionality, the <code>ApplicationDatabaseConnection</code> class could only be a factory class with <code>Create</code> methods for the different connectors (behind <code>IConnectorAFactory</code>, <code>IConnectorBFactory</code> interfaces) - but there's not really anything there to necessitate a factory pattern; there's nothing I only know when instantiating the \"controller\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the actual connector classes would essentially also need to be derivations of <code>DatabaseConnection</code> because they need the same basic abilities, and then (at the latest) the whole construct becomes rather ominous.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose I have taken a wrong turn at some point in my thinking and am now completely on the wrong track. What should the structure of such a solution look like? Any push in the right direction will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>@Tobias ' answer made me realize that I forgot an important detail: There are two different versions of the web service with pretty much the same abilities, but completely different APIs, which is one reason why it <em>has</em> to be encapsulated.</p>\n\n<p>Another one is that if my logic classes access the web service directly (or via an interface), they are also concerned with constructing the web service queries in all their detail, which makes for much more tightly coupled code (the kind we've been producing so far) and violates SRP - hence the connector interface idea.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","oop","android-fragments","android-view"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":2,"question_id":12554783,"title":"How can I use Fragments without violating core OO principles?","body":"<p>The documented Android fragment samples (<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/fragment-ui.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FragmentBasics</a>, <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/adaptui.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NewsReader</a> violate core principles of object oriented design.

Please see","body":"<p>I am curious as to how the concept of \"inheritance\" takes place in the world of object oriented programming. Let me explain my dilemma (I came across this dilemma while studying Java but I hope that my question is generic in nature) :</p>\n\n<p>Suppose there is a class A and a class B. Class A <strong>\"inherits\"</strong> Class B. What does this actually mean? Does the compiler make a <strong>\"new\"</strong> class, which is <em>THEN</em> instantiated into an object which contains the elements of both the classes A and B behind the scenes? If that's the case, then how are the access restrictions implemented according to the access specifiers?</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, I wondered if it happens in the following manner :</p>\n\n<p>An object of class A is created and then an object of class B is created. Java then somehow \"link\" the members of A to the members of B and make it appear as if they belonged to the same class and it does that according to the access specifiers. </p>\n\n<p>But then, it occurred to me that there is a fault with this theory. Suppose two different classes, B and C are inheriting class A. Then, if we are going to make objects of class B and class C, then they'll have their OWN copies of the elements of class A. So this theory fails too.</p>\n\n<p>I was just trying to explain the confusion about inheritance that I have in my mind. It's giving me headache.

Below's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class MyMovieClip extends MovieClip {\n\n        private var _isEnabled:Boolean = false;\n\n        public function MyMovieClip():void {\n\n            trace(this);\n        }\n\n        public function set isEnabled( b:Boolean ):void {\n\n            _isEnabled = b;\n        }\n\n        public function get isEnabled():Boolean {\n\n            return _isEnabled;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then I have another class where I am adding instances of the movieclip to the stage in a loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class MyOtherClass extends MovieClip {\n\n        public var myMC:MyMovieClip;\n        public var docClass:*;\n\n        public function MyOtherClass( docRef:* ):void { // passing in a reference to the DocumentClass so I can access the stage\n            docClass = docRef;\n            init();\n        }\n\n        public function init():void {\n\n            for(var i:int=0; i&lt;6; i++) {\n\n                var myMC:MyMovieClip = new MyMovieClip; // instantiate the movieclip which is exported for actionscript and has a custom class \n                //set a few native properties\n                myMC.name = \"myMC\" + i; //setting the name so I can reference this movieclip after it's been added to stage\n                myMC.y = myMC.height * i + 20;\n                myMC.x = 20;\n                myMC.alpha = .7;\n            }\n\n            dispatchEvent(new Event(MyOtherClass.MOVIECLIPS_ADDED)); // just to be safe, let's dispatch a custom event when all movieclips have been added\n        }\n\n        public function traceEnabled():void {\n\n            trace(docClass.stage.getChildByName(\"myMC1\").isEnabled); // this throws: 1119: Access of possibly undefined property isEnabled through a reference with static type flash.display:DisplayObject\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally I instantiate MyOtherClass inside my document class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n\n    public class DocumentClass extends MovieClip {\n\n        public var myOtherClass:MyOtherClass;\n\n        public function DocumentClass():void {\n\n            addEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, onAddedToStage);\n        }\n\n        public function onAddedToStage(e:Event):void {\n\n            myOtherClass = new MyOtherClass(); // upon instantiation, init is called in MyOtherClass and all of my movieclips are added to the sage\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What gives? Why can't I access the MyMovieClip property, isEnabled, after it's been added to the stage? Is there another way?

Create a Claws class and contain that within the\n  Cats class.

Usually I learn a lot by studying the class design of professional, commercial-grade frameworks, but I have to say that something doesn't quite smell right here.</p>\n\n<p>System.IO.Stream is an abstract class representing a sequence of bytes. It has 10 abstract method/properties: <code>Read, Write, Flush, Length, SetLength, Seek, Position, CanRead, CanWrite, CanSeek</code>. So many abstract members makes it cumbersome to derive from, because you have to override all those methods, even if most end up just throwing <code>NotImplemented</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Users of Stream classes are expected to call <code>CanRead</code>, <code>CanWrite</code>, or <code>CanSeek</code> to find out the capabilities of the Stream, or I suppose just go ahead and call <code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code>, or <code>Seek</code> and see if it throws <code>NotImplemented</code>. Is it just me, or is this crummy design?</p>\n\n<p>Though there are many nits I'd like to pick with the <code>Stream</code> class design, the main one I'd like to ask about is this: Why didn't they use interfaces, like <code>IReadable</code>, <code>IWriteable</code>, <code>ISeekable</code>, instead? Then a new Stream class could gracefully derive from the interfaces it supports. Isn't this the object-oriented way of doing things? Or am I missing something? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: It was pointed out that the value <code>CanRead</code> <em>et al</em> can change at runtime&mdash;for example if a <code>FileStream</code> is closed&mdash;and the point is taken. However, I remain unconvinced that this is a good design. From where I'm from, trying to read from a file that's already been closed is a bug, or at least an exceptional condition.

Ok let's get started:</p>\n\n<p>Each command in the game (what you can type into the console and hit enter) is represented by a single class both extending an abstract class and an interface from the library I am supposed to built the game on. Bellow is a class Use which represents a command for using items (e.g. you type \"use sword\" into the console and the game will look for an item called sword and call its use method):</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\n\nnamespace Game.Commands\n{\n    class Use : TextGame.Commands.ACommand, TextGame.Commands.ICommand\n    {\n        private string name;\n        public new string Name\n        {\n            set { this.name = value; }\n            get { return this.name; }\n        }\n\n        private string description;\n        public new string Description\n        {\n            set { this.description = value; }\n            get { return this.description; }\n        }\n\n        private string parameters;\n        public new string Params\n        {\n            set { this.parameters = value; }\n            get { return this.parameters; }\n        }\n\n        public Use(string name, string description) : base(name, description)\n        {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.description = description;\n        }\n\n        private TextGame.Core.GameState gameState;\n        public TextGame.Core.GameState Execute(TextGame.Core.IGame game)\n        {\n            // This is just a test because it appears the problem is\n            // with the parameters property.

The Parser class and the Game class. There are a bit longer so I will only post snippets of relevant stuff from them. Parser class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Collections; // ArrayList, Dictionary, Hashtable\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions; // regex engine\nusing Game.Commands;\n\nnamespace Game\n{\n    class Parser\n    {\n        private ArrayList commands = new ArrayList();\n\n        // All commands that are available in the game so far are\n        // initialized here in the constructor (and added to the arraylist)...\n        // skip to the other method this is not important\n        public Parser()\n        {\n            this.commands.Add(new North(\"^north\", \"Go north\"));\n            this.commands.Add(new South(\"^south\", \"Go south\"));\n            this.commands.Add(new East(\"^east\", \"Go east\"));\n            this.commands.Add(new West(\"^west\", \"Go west\"));\n            this.commands.Add(new Use(\"^use\\\\s\\\\w+\", \"Try to use the selected item\"));\n            this.commands.Add(new Quit(\"^quit\", \"Quit the game\"));\n        }\n\n        // This method takes as an argument a string representing\n        // a command you type in the console.
