Can anyone shed some light on this please? </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html","database","image","jsp"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":2,"question_id":13253260,"title":"showing database value with an image using JSP","body":"<p>I have created a simple site that reads a database table and displays it in a html table in the browser.\nI have a button that allows for the table to be altered, saved &amp; then automatically forwarded to the homepage with the updated table.\nI also have a select button with which the user can select that particular row and it updates a column in the table.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I need a way to show which row has been selected.\nI prefer to have a column in the HTML table that shows an image as to which one is selected. </p>\n\n<p>Here is my homepage where the database table is being displayed.\nIn the left column of the html is where I would like to add an image if that row is selected.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried several things like using javascript and just can't wrap my head around it?\nCan I get some help?</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;%@page contentType=\"text/html\" pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%&gt;\n&lt;%@page import=\"java.io.*, java.util.*, java.sql.*\"%&gt;\n&lt;%@page import=\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleConnection\" %&gt;\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\"&gt;\n\n    function editRecord(id) {\n        var f=document.form;\n        f.method=\"post\";\n        f.action='edit.jsp?id='+id;\n        f.submit();\n    }\n\n    function selectRecord(id, btn, i) {\n        var f=document.form;\n        f.method=\"post\";\n        f.action='select.jsp?id='+id;\n        f.submit();\n\n        if(!btn.style) {\n            alert(\"not supported\");\n            return;\n        } else{\n            btn.style.background = \"red\";\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"post\" name=\"form\"&gt;\n        &lt;table id=\"data\" border=\"1\"&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Selected&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Address&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Contact No&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Select&lt;/th&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;%\n        int sumcount=0;\n        ResultSet rs = null;\n        Connection con = null;\n        Statement st = null;\n\n        try {\n            DriverManager.registerDriver (new oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver());\n            con = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE\", \"username\", \"password\");\n\n            st = con.createStatement();\n            rs = st.executeQuery(\"SELECT * FROM employee\");\n        %&gt; \n        &lt;%\n            while(rs.next()) {\n        %&gt;\n            &lt;tr&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=rs.getString(2)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=rs.getString(3)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=rs.getString(4)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=rs.getString(5)%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" name=\"edit\" value=\"Edit\" style=\"background-color:#49743D;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff;\" onclick=\"editRecord(&lt;%=rs.getString(1)%&gt;);\" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" name=\"select\" value=\"Select\" style=\"background-color:#49743D;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff;\" onclick=\"selectRecord(&lt;%=rs.getString(1)%&gt;, this);\" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;%\n            }\n        %&gt;\n        &lt;%\n        }\n        catch(Exception e){\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        %&gt;\n\n        &lt;/table&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","image","visual-studio","silverlight","expression-blend"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":13188325,"title":"Importing an Image into Visual Studio to Code","body":"<p>I don't feel as if what I'm asking is ridiculous.

I converted the image inside of my picturebox to a bitmap, then referenced it in the last line thinking that it would work. But it had no affect at all.\nMy code is the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void ColManButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\nBitmap newimage = new Bitmap(pictureBox1.Image);\nYCbCrLinear filter = new YCbCrLinear();\nfilter.InCb = new Range(-0.276f, 0.163f);\nfilter.InCr = new Range(-0.202f, 0.500f);\nfilter.ApplyInPlace(newimage);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question essentially is, to anyone familiar or willing to help with this framework, how do I take my image and manipulate its color using AForge's YCbCrLinear Class under my button's click event?</p>\n"},{"tags":["image","matlab","image-processing","matlab-figure"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13257041,"title":"Using pcolor in matlab","body":"<p>I'm trying to use matlab's pcolor feature.

When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. If you review some of my other posts, I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue w/ the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the sd card) the application returns from the activity back to the listview activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget. </p>\n\n<p>So here is the issue, the image preview on the list view is being done w/ the cursor &amp; listadapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized (i.e. smaller bit size not pixel) image as the src for the imgbutton on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.</p>\n\n<p>** My question : is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)? - this would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row w/ touch screen b/c of focus issue. (I can use roller ball).</p>\n\n<p>** I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice if that is your suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I disabled the image on the listview it worked fine again.</p>\n\n<p>FYI : This is how I was doing it :</p>\n\n<pre><code>            String[] from = new String[] {

Doing <code>Image img = new Bitmap(url);</code> in the <code>UserControl</code> does not work in this situation because of FileIO Permission issues (Full trust or not, I have been unsuccessful in eliminating that issue).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em><strong>Initial Solution</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though using <code>canvas</code> is not a current option, I decided to test a solution using it.  I would load each image in javascript, then use <code>canvas</code> and <code>toDataUrl()</code> to get the base64 data.  Then, instead of passing the URL to the <code>UserControl</code> and have it do all the leg work, I pass the base64 data as a <code>&lt;PARAM&gt;</code> instead.  Then it quickly converts that data back to the image.</p>\n\n<p>That 15 seconds for 15 images is now less than 3 seconds.  Thus began my search for a image->base64 solution that worked in IE7/8.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here are some additional requirements/restrictions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The solution cannot have external dependencies (i.e. $.getImageData).  </li>\n<li>It needs to be 100% encapsulated so it can be portable.</li>\n<li>The source and quantity of images are variable, and they must be in URL format (base64 data up front is not an option).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope I've provided sufficient information and I appreciate any direction you're able to give.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["image","photoshop","photoshop-cs4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13173820,"title":"Image size in photoshop and other softwares","body":"<p>I had to change the size of an image to 20 kb which was 46 kb earlier.

When I press the increase size button, the original size of the image is increased on the panel, which is exactly what I want. However, when I click on my decrease size button(I figured dividing it by the scale might fix it)the label decreases, but the actual image appearance(size I guess)is changed.

I am making an app for iPhone that needs to be able to store some images from the web. The URL for the images(among other data) are stored in one table at a MySQL-server. From there, I have parsed the table with JSON, and successfully serialized this to show in a UITableView in the app. Each cell now shows the image from the imageurl-field in the table, and the title of the image as text, from the title-field in the table, both from MySQL->json.php->NSArray(json)(objectAtIndex) etc.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, every time the App launches, it gets all the information from the url with JSON.php every time, and I think it downloads the image every time aswell. I feel that this is way more work than necessary, but, as the database is going to update itself irregulary based on where it gets its data, it's not good enough to just download the information once.</p>\n\n<p>Question 1:\nI need a solution where the app \"asks\" the .php if it has the same exact data as the JSON shows. The most logical way I can think of is to add a field for \"date\" in the .php, showing which date the data was last updated, and if the app has data from the same date, nothing happens, but if the php-side date is newer than the app-side date, then it must be able to delete all stored data, and replace with the new JSON-data.</p>\n\n<p>Question 2:\nThe JSON-data is an NSArray in the iPhone, and the field for \"Image\" is just the url to the image (www.example.com/image.png), and not the actual image. How can I download these images and save them on the iPhone until a new \"version\" of the data is available through JSON?</p>\n\n<p>Bonus question:\nThe method I am using now is making the UITableView lagging when I scroll. I am no pro, but I have read several places that this can be caused by leaking memory, and I have not completely understood what this means. I also read that it can be because I maybe instantiate objects for every cell, instead of once and re-use it.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line:\nMy goal is to just have the app download all the data from the json.php once at the first app-launch, and at later launches just check if the versions are correct. If correct, no download necessary what so ever, just use the stored JSON-object containing data, and the image-files from the urls downloaded the first launch. If not correct, delete all previous stored images AND clear the json-object, and import the new updated json-object, and saving the images from the image-urls from the jsonobject somewhere on the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Updating the data (i.e adding one extra image it that is all the change that has been made) is not a solution, and not a possibility in my eyes here. When there has been an update in this database, I need ALL the information stored in the phones to clear out, and redownload all. This is because the information I put in the database, is parsed from another website, and if the new images or updates to the data contains changes of some other field, then I will much rather tweak the database to fit(through json.php) than releasing update for the app all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the wrong approach?

If I load all the images with internet connection available and then disconnect or use Edge network it again fetches the images. </p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","image","scroll"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13134275,"title":"How can i stop back scrolling in iPhone?","body":"<p>How can i set content offset in uiscrollview so that i stop back scrolling</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)layoutScrollImages\n{\n   // int n = 1 + arc4random() % 10 + 10;\n\n    UIImageView *view = nil;\n    NSArray *subviews = [FirstScrollView subviews];\n\n    // reposition all image subviews in a horizontal serial fashion\n    CGFloat curXLoc = 0;\n    for (view in subviews)\n    {\n        if ([view isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]] &amp;&amp; view.tag &gt; 0)\n        {\n            CGRect frame = view.frame;\n            frame.origin = CGPointMake(curXLoc, 0);\n            view.frame = frame;\n\n            curXLoc += (kScrollObjWidth);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // set the content size so it can be scrollable\n    [FirstScrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake((kNumImages * kScrollObjWidth), [FirstScrollView bounds].size.height)];\n\n    // FirstScrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320,500);\n\n\n    // [FirstScrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(400, 361)];\n\n    // [FirstScrollView setEnabled:YES];\n\n }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["image","html5","input","base64","filereader"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":217,"score":4,"question_id":10276224,"title":"How to preview one big picture from local file system using <input>, <img> and canvas","body":"<p>I am try to make an upload picture webpage in mobile phones, but it always run out of memory and the browser quit once the picture is too big.\nHere are my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input type=\"file\" id=\"testFile\" /&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"\" style=\"position:relative;\" id=\"uploadingImg\" /&gt;\n\nfunction setImage() {\n    var fileList   = this.files;\n    var imageType  = /image/;\n    for(var i = 0;i &lt; fileList.length;i++) {\n        document.getElementById('uploadingImg').file = fileList[i];\n        var reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = function(e) {\n            document.getElementById('uploadingImg').src = e.target.result;\n        }\n        reader.readAsDataURL(fileList[i]);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('testFile').addEventListener('change', setImage, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone knows how to preview one picture by using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element?\nPlease don't use <code>\"readAsDataURL\"</code>, because when it comes to <code>document.getElementById('uploadingImg').src = e.target.result;</code> \nIt will run out of memory.

For example, if the PictureBox is \"more widescreen\" in relation to the image (see screenshot), it means the PictureBox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally, showing its background color (in this case red) to the left and right of the image. Then I assume the image's displayed height is the same as PictureBox.Height, and work from there.</p>\n\n<p>There's a problem, though. As you can see in the screenshot (green annotation mine), the white image being stretched to fit (zoomed) inside the red PictureBox leaves a small margin at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.th.png\" alt=\"screenie\"> Click for full-size.</a></p>\n\n<p>This doesn't happen for all PictureBox.Size / Image.Size combinations, though. This leads me to believe there must be a better way to do this.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Sure, I'll do that. I just have to adapt the code to remove the context dependency.</p>\n\n<p>But the margin at the bottom does not come from my code. It comes from the PictureBox itself. Do me a favor and try the following:</p>\n\n<p>Add a PictureBox (PictureBox1) to a Form, dock it to all four sides of the Form. The code should look as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Class Form1\n\n    Private Sub Form1_Shown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown\n\n        PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom\n\n        PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Red\n        PictureBox1.Image = New Bitmap(PictureBox1.Width, PictureBox1.Height)\n        Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(PictureBox1.Image)\n\n        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, PictureBox1.Image.Width, PictureBox1.Image.Height)\n\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Run it and resize the Form so that the image is stretched (zoomed) to fill the height of the PictureBox, leaving red bars to the left and right of the white square. Now resize the Form vertically, as slow as you can. You should see a red margin at the bottom every now and then.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize, showing a margin to the right.</p>\n\n<p>It's because of this small imperfection that I know the zoom factor cannot be calculated the way I have been doing it; the result would only be an approximate. If after trying this you still think the code is relevant, then I'll gladly post it.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read and respond.</p>\n"},{"tags":["image","image-manipulation","svg","adobe-illustrator"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":8,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":7320,"score":7,"question_id":2011289,"title":"How to use .svg files in a webpage?","body":"<p>I want to know how can one actually use a .svg file In a web page?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nParastar</p>\n"},{"tags":["image",".htaccess","path","rewrite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":509,"score":0,"question_id":9700990,"title":"How to change image path using htaccess?","body":"<p>I'm fixing this joomla site.

Also with a reduced weight from the original size image by up to 25%!<br>\nI've tested this myself and I can tell that this is working quite well, in very few cases I had more weight than a normal sized image, and by negligible amounts (compared to the ease and benefits).</p>\n"},{"tags":["image","rmagick","cropping"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13118867,"title":"How to crop a single image into multiple pieces using rmagick?","body":"<p>I have a single image which has to be cropped into multiple images using the values provided in an array.\nHow can this be achieved?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","image","ftp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":86,"score":2,"question_id":13087326,"title":"Uploade image is corrupted on server","body":"<p>Hi I am trying to upload image to server using ftp4j.

On mobile devices the image might be too big to be cached, in that case it is transferred twice.  This is wrong as usually mobile devices have slow and more important expensive data links.</p>\n\n<p>We could use this method if the webserver would write a text file, like JSON or a JS snippet, which then is used to display the image.\nHowever the nice thing about this code here is, that you do not need to provide additional information.\nSo no race conditions, no new weird states like in disk full cases, just works.</p>\n\n<p>So one basic idea is to not alter the code on the webserver which generates the picture, just do it on the browser side.\nThis way all you need is a softlink from the web tree to the image and make sure, the image is atomically updated.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of <code>AJAX</code> is the same origin policy, so <code>AJAX</code> can only check the <code>HEAD</code> of resources from the host which provided the running <code>JavaScript</code> code.\nGreasemonkey or Scriptlets can circumvent that, but these cannot be deployed to a broad audience.\nSo foreign resources (images) sadly cannot be efficiently queried if they were updated or not.\nAt my side luclily both, the script and the image, originate from the same host.</p>\n\n<p>Having said this all, <strong>here are the problems with this code</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The code above adds to the delay.  First the HEAD is checked and if this shows that something has changed the update is done.\nIt would be nice to do both in one request, such that the update of the image does not require an additional roundtrip.</p>\n\n<p><code>GET</code> can archive that with If-Modified-Since, and it works on my side, however I found no way to properly display the result as an inlined image.  It might work for some browsers, but not for all.</p>\n\n<p>The code also is way too complex for my taste.  You have to deal with possible network timeouts, not overwhelming limited bandwidth, trying to be friendly to the webserver, being compatible to as many browsers as possible, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Also I would like to get rid of the hack to use a query parameter just to pull an updated image, as this slowly fills/flushes the cache.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps there is an - unknown to me - way to \"re-trigger\" image refresh in the browser?\nThis way the browser could check with If-Modified-Since directly and update the image.\nWith JavaScript this could trigger a <code>.load</code> event then or similar.\nAt my side I even do not need that at all, all I want is to keep the image somewhat current.</p>\n\n<p>I did not experiment with <code>CANVAS</code> yet.  Perhaps somebody has an idea using that.</p>\n\n<p>So my question just is, is there any better way (another algorithm) than shown above, except from improving code quality?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","image","rotation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":2,"question_id":13111654,"title":"Rotating an image and the container control in .NET","body":"<p>I am looking for a .NET Winform component with the fucntionality similar to picture box in MS Power Point that you can easily insert an image from a file and using mouse you can easily rotate or resize the image and the container control.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","image","file","bitmap"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":398,"score":0,"question_id":11202659,"title":"C# Generic Error with GDI+ on Bitmap.Save","body":"<pre><code>public void EditAndSave(String fileName) {\n    Bitmap b = new Bitmap(fileName);\n    /**\n    * Edit bitmap b... draw stuff on it...\n    **/\n    b.Save(fileName); //&lt;---------Error right here\n    b.Dispose();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My code is similar to the above code.

Does anybody know how do they do that??? </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","image","pdf","extract"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3474,"score":6,"question_id":1554484,"title":"Extract image from PDF using .Net c#","body":"<p>I want to extract images from PDF.

It's not just edge-detection, it's polygon generalization and hole-detection as well, all this in a Box2D compatible, triangulated polygon.<br>\nPlease hand me some tips on this, or a library name, or an algorithm or something..<br>\nThanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","image","screenshot","html2canvas"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1160,"score":1,"question_id":10401350,"title":"Take screenshot of <body> with html2canvas and store img as JS var","body":"<p>I am attempting to let users on my site push a button to take a screenshot of the current screen ( everything in body).</p>\n\n<p>From my research, html2canvas seems to be a resource that makes this possible.</p>\n\n<p>My issue is the documentation does not provide example code and I am struggling to get a grip on the steps involved.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The following SO question ( <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9250505/how-to-upload-a-screenshot-using-html2canvas\">How to upload a screenshot using html2canvas?</a> ) leaves me a bit confused.

I have been looking into \"tiling\" the reflection so that it presents a little of the reflection at a time, but I'm not sure what the best approach is.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the drawing code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   UIImage *mask = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@\"3.0-Carousel-Ref-Mask.jpg\" ofType:nil]];\n    //\n    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:self.name ofType: nil]];\n    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(mask.size, NO, [[UIScreen mainScreen]scale]);\n    CGContextRef ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n    CGContextTranslateCTM(ctx, 0.0, mask.size.height);\n    CGContextScaleCTM(ctx, 1.f, -1.f);\n\n    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0.f, -mask.size.height, image.size.width, image.size.height)];\n    UIImage *flippedImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();\n    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();\n\n    CGImageRef maskRef = mask.CGImage;\n    CGImageRef maskCreate = CGImageMaskCreate(CGImageGetWidth(maskRef),\n                                              CGImageGetHeight(maskRef),\n                                              CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(maskRef),\n                                              CGImageGetBitsPerPixel(maskRef),\n                                              CGImageGetBytesPerRow(maskRef),\n                                              CGImageGetDataProvider(maskRef), NULL, false);\n    CGImageRef masked = CGImageCreateWithMask([flippedImage CGImage], maskCreate);\n\n    CGImageRelease(maskCreate);\n\n    UIImage *maskedImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:masked scale:[[UIScreen mainScreen]scale] orientation:UIImageOrientationUp];\n    CGImageRelease(masked);\n\n\n    if (maskedImage) {\n        [mainView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(imageDidLoad:)\n                                             withObject:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:maskedImage, endView, nil]\n                                          waitUntilDone:YES];\n    } else\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to find sample image: %@\", self.name);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Mask is just a gradient png that I am using to mask the image. Also, if I just draw this offscreen but don't add it, there isn't hardly any lag. The lag comes from actually adding it on the main thread.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","image","filepath"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13050739,"title":"Images will only load in debug, but not when it is run outside of debug Java","body":"<p>I'm trying to figure out how and why my images will only load in debug in NetBeans, but yet when I execute the JAR file it will fail to load the images.

For example, on my server I have this file:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waher.net/w/resources/images/logo.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.waher.net/w/resources/images/logo.png</a></p>\n\n<p>But in my HTML, I load my image from a URL like this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waher.net/w/resources/images/160x160&amp;logo.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.waher.net/w/resources/images/160x160&amp;logo.png</a></p>\n\n<p>This '160x160&amp;logo.png' file does not actually exist and the only file that exists is 'logo.png'. Every HTTP request is routed to PHP and parameters in the file URL are parsed in order to apply additional functionality, like picture resolution. </p>\n\n<p>Why is this useful? If my system has a large number of user avatars and my design changes, I can easily change the avatar picture URL's and everything works as expected. I never have to regenerate all the avatars of all my users, especially of those users that do not exist in my system anymore and just waste resources.</p>\n\n<p>But here's my problem, if I want to implement Nginx to serve static files on my server, my system does not work. This is because Nginx will attempt to load static files itself and throws a 404 Not Found message if picture was not found. I assume that the same is true with Apache and Squid.</p>\n\n<p>One of my clients specifically requested that they wish to serve images and resources through Nginx instead, but they would still like the dynamic images for the ease of development and design.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to tell Nginx or Squid to send the request to PHP, if the image file itself is not found, get the 'dynamic' image from PHP and then send it to a user through Nginx? And at the same time always serving it from Nginx cache in any subsequent request to the same file?</p>\n\n<p>I want to have the flexibility of dynamically loaded image files, but also have the speed of Nginx when serving image files. Is something like this possible? Do I need to set specific file headers in PHP that allow for this? (I already set cache and expire headers).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","image","text","itext"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":1,"question_id":13030250,"title":"Image in between a paragraph Using iText","body":"<p>I am using iText to generate my custom .pdf document.

This allows for layer adjustment of images on websites which do not have layer information already.</p>\n"},{"tags":["css","image","css-float","vertical-alignment"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":1,"question_id":13018996,"title":"CSS: Vertically Align Text next to Icon using Floating Divs","body":"<p>I'm trying to align a Text next to an Icon/Image, I want the text or the image to be align vertically but the vertical-align is not being applied, it might have something to do with the floats</p>\n\n<p>Here's an image explainng what I want to do:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYFH7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>\n\n<p>---- HTML ---</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul class=\"toolboxItems\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"image\"&gt;\n             &lt;img src=\"someImage.png\"&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"label\"&gt;\n           &lt;label&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet....&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        /* more of the same .... */\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>---- CSS ----</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.toolboxItems li {margin-bottom:10px;}\n.image {float:left; width:30px;}\n.label {float:left; width:150px; vertical-align:middle;}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried using display:table / table-cell but it did not work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","image","gallery"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13019119,"title":"Gallery to display latest image and back/forward buttons to scroll through older images.

I tried creating a method on the repository that creates a new instance of the Context in a \"using\" statement to see if this would improve things but it didn't.\nSo is there anything I can do?

Let me explain:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4IqZT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The image above has one <strong>figure</strong> (in the image there can be multiple figures, but let us forget about that for now).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The background color of the canvas is the pixel at 0,0 (in this case, yellow)</li>\n<li>The border color of the figure is black (it can be any color other than the canvas' background color).</li>\n<li>The figure's background color is white (it can also be the same as the canvas' background color).</li>\n<li>A figure can only have one background color.</li>\n<li>There are two pixel groups in the figure. One is a pool of blue pixels, and the other is a pool of red with some green inside. As you can see, it doesn't matter the color of the pixel group's pixels (it is just different than the figure's background color). What matters is the fact that they're in contact (even diagonally). So despite having two different colors, such group is considered as just one anyway.</li>\n<li>As you can see, the border can be as irregular as you wish. It only has, however, one color.</li>\n<li>It is known that a pixel group will not touch the border.</li>\n<li>I was told that a pixel group's colors can be any except the figure's background color. I assume that then it can be the same as the figure's border color (black).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We have been given a class capable of taking images and converting them to a matrix (each element being an integer representing the color of the pixel).</p>\n\n<p>And that's it. I'm doing it with Java.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT HAVE I DONE SO FAR</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Iterate through each pixel in the matrix</li>\n<li>If I find a pixel that is different from the background color, I will assume it belongs to the border of the figure. I will call this pixel <code>initialPixel</code> from now on.</li>\n<li>Note that the <code>initialPixel</code> in the image I provided is that black pixel in the top-left corner of the figure. I made a sharp cut there purposefully to illustrate it.</li>\n<li>My mission now is to find the background color of the figure (in this case white).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But I'm having quite a great deal of trouble to find such background color (white). This is the closest method I did, which worked for some cases - but not with this image:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since I know the color of the border, I could find the first different color that is to the <strong>south</strong> of the <code>initialPixel</code>. Did sound like a good idea - it did work sometimes, but it would not work with the image provided: it will return yellow in this case, since <code>initialPixel</code> is quite away from the figure's contents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Assuming I did find the figure's background color (white), my next task would be to realize that there exist two pixel groups within the figure. This one seems easier:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since I now know the figure's background color (white), I can try iterating through each pixel within the figure and, if I find one that does not belong to the border and is not part of the figure's background, I can already tell there is one pixel group. I can begin a recursive function to find all pixels related to such group and \"flag\" them so that in the future iterations I can completely ignore such pixels.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT I NEED</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, my problem is about how to find the figure's background color (keep in mind it can be the same as the whole image's background color - for now it is yellow, but it can be white as well) based on what I described before.</p>\n\n<p>I don't need any code - I'm just having trouble thinking a proper algorithm for such. The fact that the border can have such weird irregular lines is killing me.</p>\n\n<p>Or even better: have I been doing it wrong all along? Maybe I shouldn't have focused so much on that <code>initialPixel</code> at all. Maybe a different kind of initial method would have worked? Are there any documents/examples about topics like this?

Kindly provide example codes with comments to elaborate on their function, and also if it's in its own class, how to call on relevant methods used by it on other classes.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","sql-server","image","resize"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12985993,"title":"Receive image after re sizing from source","body":"<p>How to receive an image file with reduced size from server by direct linking?\nExplained: Actual url= <a href=\"http://domain.com/image.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://domain.com/image.jpg</a> has h=200, with=200\nI want this file with already reduced from server to 50 by 50.\nNow get file url= <a href=\"http://anotherDomain.com?file=http://domain.com/image.jpg&amp;h=50&amp;w=50\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://anotherDomain.com?file=http://domain.com/image.jpg&amp;h=50&amp;w=50</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["android","image","camera","onresume"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12985549,"title":"Show captured picture when activity opened again","body":"<p>I have an activity that calls the camera intent to capture a picture and assign it as a profile picture.
