The <a href=\"http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/ntdll/thread.c#L766\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wine source for the guts of GetThreadContext</a> contains\nan Access Denied return response on line 819 when an attempt to grab the thread state fails for some reason.

Why that would be true after a SuspendThead is beyond me, but there's the code.  Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: <em>I lied again</em>.  I said we only saw the behavior on Wine.  Nope... we have now found a Vista Ultimate system that seems to produce the same error (again, rarely).   So, it appears that Wine and Windows agree on an obscure case. It also appears that the mere enabling of the Sysinternals Process monitor program aggravates the situation and causes the problem to appear on Windows XP 64; I suspect a Heisenbug.  (The Process Monitor\ndoesn't even exist on the Wine-tasting (:-) machine or the XP 64 system I use for development).</p>\n\n<p>What on earth is it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: Sept 15 2010.  I've added careful checking to the error return status, without otherwise disturbing the code, for SuspendThread, ResumeThread, and GetContext.  I haven't seen <em>any</em> hint of this behavior on Windows systems since I did that.  Haven't gotten back to the Wine experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2010: Strange.  It seems that if I compile this under VisualStudio 2005, it fails on Windows Vista and 7, but not earlier OSes.  If I compile under VisualStudio 2010, it doesn't fail anywhere.  One might point a finger at VisualStudio2005, but I'm suspicious of a location-sensitivve problem, and different optimizers in VS 2005 and VS 2010 place the code a slightly different places.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2012: Saga continues.  We see this failure on a number of XP and Windows 7 machines, at a pretty low rate (once every several thousand runs).  Our Suspend activities are applied to threads that mostly execute pure computational code but that sometimes make calls into Windows.    I don't recall seeing this issue when the PC of the thread was in our computational code.   Of course, I can't see the PC of the thread when it hangs because GetContext won't give it to me, so I can't directly confirm that the problem only happens when executing system calls.  But, all our system calls are channeled through one point, and so far the evidence is that point was executed when we get the hang. So the indirect evidence suggests GetContext on a thread only fails if a system call is being executed by that thread.    I haven't had the energy to build a critical experiment to test this hypothesis yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","web-services","delphi","winapi","com"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":592,"score":4,"question_id":5881070,"title":"How to access a .Net web service from a Delphi Win32 application?","body":"<p>What options do I have if I want to enable a Delphi Win32 application to consume a .Net webservice?</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to interact directly?

As every year the database will need to be updated.  Was trying to find a cleaner solution to find the application, then uninstall the application. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that clarifies the issue.

Furthermore, the 32 bit process has the kernel32.dll loaded at a different base address, which makes creation of the remote thread even more impossible.</p>\n\n<p>To make clear what I mean, the following happens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Injector has 64 bit version of <strong>kernel32.dll</strong> loaded at 0x12340000</li>\n<li>Injector retrieves handle for <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong> 0x00005678 from this kernel32.dll</li>\n<li>Target has 32 bit version of <strong>kernel32.dll</strong> loaded at 0xABCD0000</li>\n<li>The handle for <strong>LoadLibrary</strong> of this kernel32.dll is expected to be 0x0000EFAB</li>\n<li>Injector tries to start remote thread in target with function 0x12345678, but 0xABCDEFAB is expected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When injecting a 64 bit process from a 64 bit process, and 32 bit from 32 bit, there is usually no problem, as the kernel32.dll is (most likely) loaded at the same base address and the same function address can be used - that's my unterstanding so far. In this case however the conditions differ.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome the problem I did the following steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>64 bit Injector retrieves address of kernel32.dll loaded by 32 bit target using <strong>EnumProcessModulesEx()</strong> (should be 0xABCD000)</li>\n<li>Get filename of that <strong>kernel32.dll</strong>, parse the PE header and get the RVA of <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong> (should be 0x000EFAB)</li>\n<li>At this point, we know where <strong>kernel32.dll</strong> is loaded in the 32 bit target and the address of the function from this DLL.</li>\n<li>64 bit Injector starts remote thread in 32 bit target with <strong>ImageBase + Function RVA</strong>, in this case the magical 0xABCDEFAB</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This approach actually works very well, but I can't get rid of the thought that this is total overhead and there must be a more simpler solution to inject 32 bit targets from 64 bit injectors.</p>\n\n<p>I have two questions, for which I am very grateful if they could be answered here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a more simple way to achieve this kind of injection?</li>\n<li>Are there possible problems with the approach I've been taking that I haven't thought about?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any answers are very much appreciated, thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Oh my gosh... I just realized, that I described the situation wrong in my initial post. The INJECTOR is 64 bit, and the TARGET is 32 bit (Initially it was the other way around, but I already corrected it). Ben Voigt's comments down below are totally true, the call to EnumProcessModulesEx would fail.

The general consensus online is that you shouldn't expect such mappings to exist, because physical media need not have partitions or volumes, etc, but in my case I basically know it <em>does</em> exist, and would error out in some meaningful way if the expected mapping were missing.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, my only strategy is to enumerate all the volumes and just look for the appropriate file in all CD drives, maybe keeping track of any such devices that have been recognized after my encrypted USB drive was connected.

It listens on one port throughout the run of the program, and waits for connections from distant peers.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, this works well. However, due to some problems I'd experienced, I've decided to add a simple debug print directly after the call to <code>WSARecvFrom</code> (the win32 function used in the library to recv datagrams from my socket of interest, and tell what IP and port they came from).<br>\nStrangely enough, in some cases, I've discovered packets are dropped at the <strong>OS level</strong> (i.e. I see them in Wireshark, they have the right dst-port, all checksums are correct - but they never appear in the debug prints I've implanted into the code).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm fully of the fact (people tend to mention a bit too often) that \"UDP doesn't guarantee delivery\" - but this is not relevant, as the packets <strong>are</strong> received by the machine - I see them in Wireshark.<br>\nAlso, I'm familiar with OS buffers and the potential to fill up, but here comes the weird part...</p>\n\n<p>I've done some research trying to find out which packets are dropped exactly. What I've discovered, is that all dropped packets share two things in common (though <em>some</em>, but definitely not <em>most</em>, of the packets that <em>aren't</em> dropped share these as well):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They are small. Many of the packets in the protocol are large, close to MTU - but all packets that are dropped are under 100 bytes (gross).</li>\n<li>They are always one of two: a SYN-equivalent (i.e. the first packet a peer sends to us in order to initiate communications) or a FIN-equivalent (i.e. a packet a peer sends when it is no longer interested in talking to us).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can either one of these two qualities affect the OS buffers, and cause packets to be randomly (or even more interesting - selectively) dropped?<br>\nAny light shed on this strange issue would be very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (24/10/12):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think I may have missed an important detail. It seems that the packets dropped before arrival share something else in common: They (and I'm starting to believe, <em>only</em> they) are sent to the server by \"new\" peers, i.e. peers that it <strong>hasn't tried to contact before</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a syn-equivalent packet arrives from a peer* we've never seen before, it will not be seen by <code>WSARecvFrom</code>. However, if we have sent a syn-equivalent packet to that peer <strong>ourselves</strong> (even if it didn't reply at the time), and now it sends <strong>us</strong> a syn-equivalent, we will see it.</p>\n\n<p>(*) I'm not sure whether this is a <em>peer</em> we haven't seen (i.e. ip:port) or just a <em>port</em> we haven't seen before.</p>\n\n<p>Does this help?<br>\nIs this some kind of WinSock option I've never heard of?

For a virtual member of an object, I get the <code>foo</code> pointer from the <code>vtable</code> itself as I've shown above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reinterpret_cast&lt;FUNC_TYPE&gt;(\n    *(reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(\n        *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(objptr)) + n\n    )\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Second problem.</strong> Can't I get by with simply modifying the entries from the <code>vtable</code> for my object? Here's an example, needless to say, it doesn't work for the <code>pDev</code> object, as taken directly from Direct3D, but <a href=\"http://taksi.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taksi</a> seems to use this method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass BaseClass\n{\npublic:\n    BaseClass(int a = 0, int b = 0);\n    int GetA();\n    int GetB();\n    virtual void Test();\nprivate:\n    int _a;\n    int _b;\n};\n\nBaseClass::BaseClass(int a, int b) :\n    _a(a),\n    _b(b)\n{\n}\n\nint BaseClass::GetA()\n{\n    return _a;\n}\n\nint BaseClass::GetB()\n{\n    return _b;\n}\n\nvoid BaseClass::Test()\n{\n    printf(\"test %d; %d\\n\", _a, _b);\n}\n\nvoid TheNewFunction(BaseClass *bc)\n{\n    printf(\"I am an intruder\\n\");\n}\n\ntypedef void (*PROC_TYPE)(BaseClass *);\n\nint main()\n{\n    BaseClass foo(5, 56);\n    PROC_TYPE proc = 0;\n    proc = reinterpret_cast&lt;PROC_TYPE&gt;(\n        *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(\n            *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;foo)\n        )\n    );\n    proc(&amp;foo);\n    reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(\n        *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;foo)\n    )[0] = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(TheNewFunction);\n\n    foo.Test(); // runs same old Test(); maybe due to compiler optimization?\n    proc = reinterpret_cast&lt;PROC_TYPE&gt;(\n        *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(\n            *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;foo)\n        )\n    );\n\n    proc(&amp;foo); // runs TheNewFunction\n    BaseClass *goo = &amp;foo;\n    goo-&gt;Test(); // runs TheNewFunction\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c","multithreading","winapi"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":2,"question_id":13021015,"title":"Passing a parameter to threads in a loop","body":"<p>I need to create 10 threads and print out the threadId with which thread printed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nDWORD WINAPI xprint(LPVOID Param)\n{\nDWORD tID = GetCurrentThreadId();\nint count = *(int*)Param + 1;\n\nfprintf(stderr, \"Thread Number:%d ThreadID:%d\\n\", count, tID);\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nint main ()\n{\n   DWORD ThreadID[10];\n   HANDLE ThreadHandle[10];\n   int i;\n\n   for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++){\n\n    ThreadHandle[i] = CreateThread(\n      NULL,\n          0,\n          xprint,\n          &amp;i,\n          0,\n          &amp;ThreadID[i]);\n\n    if (ThreadHandle[i] == NULL) {\n        fprintf(stderr,\"Can't create thread!\\n\");\n        return -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++){\n            WaitForSingleObject(ThreadHandle[i],INFINITE);\n        CloseHandle(ThreadHandle[i]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread Number:1 ThreadID:4952\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5284\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5084\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5656\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5292\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:3072\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5904\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:3620\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:6056\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5676\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't know where i did wrong.\nmy desired output should look something like this.</p>\n\n<p>output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread Number:10 ThreadID:4952\nThread Number:8 ThreadID:5284\nThread Number:3 ThreadID:5084\nThread Number:9 ThreadID:5656\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:5292\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:3072\nThread Number:5 ThreadID:5904\nThread Number:6 ThreadID:3620\nThread Number:4 ThreadID:6056\nThread Number:7 ThreadID:5676\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Thread Number should be *out of order.</p>\n\n<p><em>*</em> After posting this question i ran the program a few more times\noutput:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread Number:2 ThreadID:4500\nThread Number:7 ThreadID:5740\nThread Number:7 ThreadID:3772\nThread Number:1 ThreadID:4732\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:4252\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:4264\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:5544\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:4116\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:5240\nThread Number:2 ThreadID:4804\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it seems like the thread number is random. but in any case, no same number should appear twice.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","winapi","file"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":14,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6333,"score":14,"question_id":3828835,"title":"How can we check if a file Exists or not using Win32 program?","body":"<p>How can we check if a file Exists or not using a Win32 program?

Why?","body":"<p>While developing a program the other day, I had to convert an ASCII string into a Unicode string. I'm working on Windows with Visual Studio 2012, by the way. I noticed some strange behaviour with the Win32 function <code>MultiByteToWideChar</code> which I couldn't sort out. I wrote some test code, below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    /* Create const test string */\n    char str[] = \"test string\";\n\n    /* Create empty wchar_t buffer to hold Unicode form of above string, and initialize (zero) it */\n    wchar_t *buffer = (wchar_t*) LocalAlloc(LMEM_ZEROINIT, sizeof(wchar_t) * strlen(str));\n\n    /* Convert str to Unicode and store in buffer */\n    int result = MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8, NULL, str, strlen(str), buffer, strlen(str));\n    if (result == 0)\n        printf(\"GetLastError result: %d\\n\", GetLastError());\n\n    /* Print MultiByteToWideChar result, str's length, and buffer's length */\n    printf_s(\n        \"MultiByteToWideChar result: %d\\n\"\n        \"'str' length: %d\\n\"\n        \"'buffer' length: %d\\n\",\n        result, strlen(str), wcslen(buffer));\n\n    /* Create a message box to display the Unicode string */\n    MessageBoxW(NULL, buffer, L\"'buffer' contents\", MB_OK);\n\n    /* Also write buffer to file, raw */\n    FILE *stream = NULL;\n    fopen_s(&amp;stream, \"c:\\\\test.dat\", \"wb\");\n    fwrite(buffer, sizeof(wchar_t), wcslen(buffer), stream);\n    fclose(stream);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it simply takes an ordinary character string, creates a buffer to store the Unicode string in, puts that converted Unicode string into the buffer, and shows me some results, also writing the buffer to a file.</p>\n\n<p>The output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MultiByteToWideChar result: 11\n'str' length: 11\n'buffer' length: 16\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Already weird. The function is processing the correct number of characters in the C string, but <code>wcslen</code> is reporting the output buffer to be longer than the C string! I'm pretty sure I allocated the buffer correctly, too.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried using different sized string lengths, but there's always junk at the end, and <code>wcslen</code> always reports the buffer's length to be a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, for this particular string (<code>\"test string\"</code>), here's the raw buffer that was printed to file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>74 00 65 00 73 00 74 00 20 00 73 00 74 00 72 00   t.e.s.t. .s.t.r.\n69 00 6E 00 67 00 AB AB AB AB AB AB AB AB EE FE   i.n.g...........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(That's 32 bytes, or 16 Unicode characters.)</p>\n\n<p>The 10 bytes at the end are five characters; four <a href=\"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/abab/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">U+ABAB</a>, and one <a href=\"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/feee/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">U+FEEE</a>, which are meaningless to me.</p>\n\n<p>In different amounts, they occur <strong>every time</strong> I try converting a string.</p>\n\n<p>I'm kinda out of ideas.

My .Net/C# is solid enough, and my C/C++ is meh.</p>\n\n<p>Lately, I'm finding that there are no libraries in the standard .Net framework to accomplish certain tasks, and while it's easy enough to download a third party library, I'd like to understand how to do it myself if one doesn't already exist.  </p>\n\n<p>In one recent case, I need to deal with MIDI in windows at a relatively low-level, and I accidentally found out that \"winmm.dll\" is the library I'll need to use by downloading a .net wrapper for MIDI and browsing through the source.  I understand that I'll have to make a wrapper class and do the whole P/Invoke thing to make that happen.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing I did was to search for documentation on the Windows API to figure out what was going on in the mystery box of \"winmm.dll,\" and to my delight, there was a whole Windows SDK that I was able to download and read through.  I went through the \"getting started\" section of \"Windows Development\" which covered some of the basics via C++.  It talked a bit about COM, windows header files, and I know enough C++ to get the gist.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I need help connecting the dots on a few issues:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Windows SDK, so far, seems to suggest that I want to program to specific header files rather than the dlls themselves, but the .net wrappers I've found typically point to a specific .dll rather that a header file...</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Returns the number of MIDI input devices on this system.\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\n/// Win32 docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms711608(VS.85).aspx\n[DllImport(\"winmm.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\npublic static extern UInt32 midiInGetNumDevs();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was under the impression that a header file and DLL needed to be in the same folder, but the windows SDK includes a folder with all the windows header files, and no DLLs (I'm guessing the registry comes into play here for mapping to specific libraries?)?  How do those header files eventually get mapped to actual libraries, and why does it seem like I don't even need to deal with header files to create a .Net wrapper?</p>\n\n<p>2) I can't seem to find documentation on winmm.dll, but I have found references to the functions I'll likely need in the \"Windows API\" list in the Windows SDK, and I'm pretty sure that the code for those functions are in winmm.dll.  How do I find the documentation for the specific libraries I'll need to begin creating my wrapper?  If I didn't know that I was going to need winmm.dll to access windows MIDI functionality, how could I have figured that out myself?</p>\n\n<p>3) Some DLLs are COM, some are plain windows DLLs, some are .net DLLs... how can I tell the different going forward?  It seems that creating wrappers for the former two would require a different approach.</p>\n\n<p>4) There is no page on MSDN for \"Winmm.dll\" listing all of its API, and I assume there's a good and practical reason for that, but I'm not sure what it is?  I'm used to .Net land where I can figure out what a library does and how to use it almost without effort.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insights.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","winapi","ipad","ios"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1327,"score":0,"question_id":4845451,"title":"Wait for NSThread","body":"<p>I have a many NSThreads, and I want to sleep during the time when they are working.

However, when rendering to a bitmap, the dots-per-inch of the bitmap's device context is the same as the display device's DPI, which is 96 dots-per-inch.  This is much lower than what I would like to render to.  I'd rather render at a much higher DPI so that the user can zoom in, and perhaps print on a high-DPI printer later.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect what happens is that the RTF control calls <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd144877%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>GetDeviceCaps</code></a> with <code>LOGPIXELSX</code> and <code>LOGPIXELSY</code> to get the number of pixels per inch of the device.  It then renders the document using this DPI value at a 100% zoom level.  Windows display devices always return a value of 96 DPI, unless large fonts are being used on the system (as set in Control Panel) and the application is DPI-aware.</p>\n\n<p>Many examples on the Internet propose scaling the output of <code>EM_FORMATRANGE</code>.  This is so that any arbitrary DPI resolution can be achieved.  Most examples generally involve using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd162980%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>SetMapMode</code></a>, <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145100%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>SetWindowExtEx</code></a>, and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145098%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>SetViewportExtEx</code></a> (e.g. see <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/netfxbcl/thread/37fd1bfb-f07b-421d-9b5e-5f4492ffbbc3\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/netfxbcl/thread/37fd1bfb-f07b-421d-9b5e-5f4492ffbbc3</a>).  These functions can be used to scale the rich text control's rendered output:  for example, if I specify 400% scaling, then if the rich text control rendered something that was 5 pixels wide, it would actually become 20 pixels wide.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the old GDI functions use integers instead of floating point numbers.  For example, suppose the RTF control decided that an element should be drawn at (12.7, 15.3) pixels.  This would be rounded to a position of (13, 15).  These rounded coordinates are passed to GDI, which then scales up the image using scaling specified by <code>SetMapMode</code>: for the example of 400%, it would be (13*4, 15*4), or (52, 60).  But this is not accurate: the element would have better been placed at (12.7*4, 15.3*4), or (51, 61).  The worst part is that for some cases, the error becomes cumulative.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is the underlying cause of this very noticeable error when scaling some simple text:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIF4h.png\" alt=\"Rendered using EM_FORMATRANGE&lt;code&gt;and scaled with&lt;/code&gt;SetMapMode\"></p>\n\n<p>The above example is 8 point Segoe UI, scaled to 400% using <code>EM_FORMATRANGE</code> and <code>SetMapMode</code> on a 96 DPI display device context.  The text has now become 32 point size, but the space between each character is too high and looks unnatural.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/17SSe.png\" alt=\"Zoomed to 400% in WordPad\"></p>\n\n<p>The above example was created in WordPad by entering the text as 8 point Segoe UI and then using the zoom control to set to a 400% zoom level.  The space between each character looks normal.  The exact same result is achieved with a 32 point font and 100% zoom level.</p>\n\n<p>To work around this issue, I have tried the following.  For each thing tried, the result has been identically unsatisfactory when scaled to 400%.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using a scaling transform set using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145104%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>SetWorldTransform</code></a> instead of the scaling done with <code>SetMapMode</code> and <code>SetWindowExtEx</code> etc.</li>\n<li>Passing the device context for a metafile to <code>EM_FORMATRANGE</code>, and then scaling the metafile later.</li>\n<li>Using <code>SetMapMode</code> to scale in conjunction with rendering to a metafile, and then showing the metafile later without scaling.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I believe the results are always unsatisfactory because the problem boils down to the fact that the rich edit control is rounding to the nearest integer and rendering to what it thinks is a 96 DPI device - ignoring the transforms in place.  I looked into the metafile format and what I discovered is that the individual character positions are actually stored in the metafile at pixel-level resolution - that's why scaling the metafile obviously didn't work since the rounding has already happened by that point.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of two real solutions that would work around this issue:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use a device context with a higher user-specified dots per inch, such that <code>GetDeviceCaps</code> returns different values.  (Note: some examples propose using the printer device since they generally have higher DPI, but I want my code to work on systems that don't have a printer and be able to render to an off-screen buffer).</li>\n<li>Some way to tell the rich edit control to assume the device context has a different dots per inch than reported by <code>GetDeviceCaps</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anything else seems like it would still be subject to these rounding errors.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone (1) have an idea of how to implement either of the solutions I have proposed, or (2) have an alternate idea of how to achieve my goal of getting an accurate high-DPI output into a buffer?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","winapi","asynchronous","readfile","createfile"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":790,"score":1,"question_id":9373632,"title":"Readfile async - iso files c++","body":"<p>In my c++ application I'm rying to read iso file asynchronous by <code>createfile</code> - with overlapped flag and after it - <code>readfile</code>.\nhowever when I try this code on a simple file (txt file for example) it works. but when I run this code on iso file - it fails.\nI saw in MSDN that compressed file can only read by readfile sync calls. does iso files is in this category?\nif yes - do you have other suggestion how to read iso files async?</p>\n\n<p>this is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])\n{\n\n\nHANDLE hFile;\n    DWORD NumberOfBytesRead = 0, dw;\n    BYTE *buf = (BYTE*)malloc(BUF_SIZE*sizeof(BYTE));\n    OVERLAPPED overlapped;\n    overlapped.Offset = overlapped.OffsetHigh = 0;  \n    memset(buf, 0, 1024);\n\noverlapped.hEvent = CreateEvent(NULL, true, false, NULL); \nif(NULL == overlapped.hEvent)\n    printf(\"error\");\n\nhFile = CreateFile(\"xxx.iso\",\n                  GENERIC_READ,\n                  FILE_SHARE_READ,\n                  NULL,\n                  OPEN_EXISTING,\n    FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING , \n                  NULL);\n\n\n\nif (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)\n        printf(\"invalid hfile\\n\");\n\n   int i;   \n   i= ReadFile(hFile,\n                 buf,\n                 BUF_SIZE,\n                 &amp;NumberOfBytesRead,\n        &amp;overlapped);\n   if( GetLastError() == ERROR_IO_PENDING)\n   {\n\n\n       dw = WaitForSingleObject(overlapped.hEvent, INFINITE);\n    if(dw ==  WAIT_OBJECT_0)\n        if (GetOverlappedResult(hFile,&amp;overlapped,&amp;NumberOfBytesRead, TRUE) != 0)   \n        {\n            if (NumberOfBytesRead != 0) \n            {\n                printf(\"!!!\\n\");\n            }\n\n        }\n\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","winapi","application","registry","settings"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":114,"score":1,"question_id":12819613,"title":"Win32 Application Settings","body":"<p>How can I store settings that can later be loaded into my application?</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I have an edit control that the user can change the font, font color, and background color of.

Here is what I have so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Get all of the devices\nPCTSTR enumType = \"PORTS\";\nHDEVINFO devs = NULL;\ndevs = SetupDiGetClassDevs(NULL,enumType,0,DIGCF_PRESENT | DIGCF_ALLCLASSES);\n\n// Loop through the devices\nDWORD devCount = 0;\nSP_DEVINFO_DATA devInfo;\nint enumeratingDevices = 1;\ndevInfo.cbSize = sizeof(SP_DEVINFO_DATA);\nwhile(enumeratingDevices){\n    enumeratingDevices = SetupDiEnumDeviceInfo (devs,devCount,&amp;devInfo);\n    // Uninstall each device\n    cout &lt;&lt; SetupDiRemoveDevice(devs,&amp;devInfo);\n    cout &lt;&lt; SetupDiCallClassInstaller(DIF_REMOVE,&amp;devInfo,NULL);\n    devCount++;\n}\ncout &lt;&lt; devCount;\nSetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList(devs);\nreturn 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right now I am getting an output of <code>001</code>. So, basically, <code>SetupDiEnumDeviceInfo()</code> or<code>SetupDiRemoveDevice</code> do not run correctly. I know that the enumeration is working because if I put in <code>enumType = \"USB\";</code> I get ten for the devCount.</p>\n\n<p>Any help or advice would be great.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","winapi","filesystems","ntfs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":13,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":337,"score":9,"question_id":12751684,"title":"How do I determine the degree in which a file is fragmented?","body":"<p>I would like to provide a way to recognize when a large file is fragmented to a certain extent, and alert the user when they should perform a defragmentation.

I have verified that this never happens and I have even tried to declare the OVERLAPPED struct as static, same problem remains. If the OVERLAPPED struct had gone out of scope, I would expect the callback to point at the memory location where the struct was previously allocated, but it doesn't, it points somewhere else, at an entirely unfamiliar memory location. Why it does that, I have no idea.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Windows 7/64 makes an internal hardcopy of the OVERLAPPED struct? I can see how that would cause this behavior, since I am relying on additional parameters sneaked in at the end of the struct (which seems like a hack to me, but apparently I got that \"hack\" from official MSDN examples).</p>\n\n<p>I have also tried to change calling convention but this doesn't work at all, if I change it then the program crashes. (The standard calling convention causes it to crash, whatever standard is, cdecl? __fastcall also causes a crash.) The calling conventions that work are __stdcall, WINAPI and CALLBACK. I think these are all same names for __stdcall and I read somewhere that Win 64 ignores that calling convention anyhow.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that the callback is executed because of some \"spurious disturbance\" in Win 7/64 generating false callback calls with corrupt or irrelevant parameters. </p>\n\n<p>Multi-thread race conditions is another theory, but in the scenario I am running to reproduce the bug, there is only one thread, and I can confirm that the thread calling ReadFileEx is the same one that is executing the callback.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","windows","winapi","wmi","jacob"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":119,"score":1,"question_id":12698653,"title":"(SOLVED) Java JACOB retrieve all the properties for a given Win32_* class object","body":"<p>I am currently working on a java-base cross-platform software distributor and I chose to use native OS mechanisms to prevent the users from having to do any setup before hand.</p>\n\n<p>I chose JSCH for SSH2 and JACOB for Java.

Exactly i need to drop entire keystroke if it was inputed too fast (i.e. input wasn't actually from user, but from some HID keyboard device, like barcode scanner). What i need to do is for each symbol i'm gonna wait for 30 ms and then if none further symbols applied i need to send it to window it was meant for. And that check need to be performed on each WM_KEYDOWN.  If new symbol applied i will push it to my queue along with any further symbols that will go within 30 ms limit between messages (actually i tested on my computer it takes something like 31-32 ms to input symbol and barcode scanner needs something like 15-16 ms which will be sufficent). </p>\n\n<p>I figured out following algorithm: \n1. If incoming message is WM_KEYDOWN - store it (with time offcourse). \n2. If next incoming message isn't WM_KEYDOWN or time-limit exceeded - send stored message to it's recipient and store current message if it's WM_KEYDOWN - go to step 1. \n3. If next message came in 30 ms limit - store it too.\n4. If next message is VK_RETURN or sequence is longer than 128 symbols - drop current sequence and store it as barcode. Goto step 1. </p>\n\n<p>Current flaw in this algorithm is that sendMessage thing. I used both sendMessage and postMessage but they both just resend it to my hook procedure (which is obvious i guess). Is there any way to just send this message directly to window it was mento to be send? </p>\n\n<p>Or maybe there are other solution for my problem? </p>\n\n<p>My explanation may seem ambiguous so i just write what i need to achieve: \nI need to intercept barcode scanner input before it actually reaches window procedure, so no WM_KEYDOWN messages from scanner will reach target window. A barcode message are typically comes with 15-16ms interval between single WM_KEYDOWNs and ends with VK_RETURN.</p>\n\n<p>Also i need to use exactly WH_GETMESSAGE (or similiar hook that will allow me to catch both WM_INPUT and WM_KEYDOWN). WM_INPUT is needed to distinguish input from various devices (basically i'm going to enum all HID keyboards, determine which of them send barcodes if such event occurs i will flag device as barcode scanner and store it's VID&amp;PID to local database and it will be use for other). </p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","winapi","boost","signals"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":98,"score":0,"question_id":12694077,"title":"Convert boost::bind object to function pointer - implementing message map","body":"<p>I'm thinking of creating a Window class library that uses Win32 API and C++ standard libraries<br>\nAnd I'd like to add signal/slot functionality that handles window messages.</p>\n\n<pre><code>using namespace std;\nusing namespace boost::signals2;\ntypedef signal&lt;void (Window*, EventArgs*)&gt; WndEvent; \n\nclass EventArgs { public: HWND hWnd; WPARAM wParam; LPARAM lParam; };\n\nclass Window {\n    protected: unordered_map&lt;UINT, WndMsg*&gt; msgMap;\n    public: void addMsgHandler(UINT msg, void (*handler)(Window*, EventArgs*)) {\n        auto iter=msgMap.find(msg);\n        if(iter==msgMap.end()) {\n            WndEvent* newEvent = new WndEvent();\n            newEvent-&gt;connect(handler);\n            msgMap.insert(make_pair(msg, newEvent));\n        }\n        else iter-&gt;second-&gt;connect(handler);\n    }\n\n    private: LRESULT wndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lparam) {\n        for(auto iter=msgMap.begin(); iter!=msgMap.end(); iter++)\n            iter-&gt;second-&gt;();\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In using that library:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Form : public Window {\n    void initialize() {// add here pair of 'message' and 'corresponding handler'\n        addMsgHandler(WM_LBUTTONUP, boost::bind(&amp;Form::onLButtonUp, this, _1, _2));\n        ...\n    }\n    void onLButtonUp(Window* sender, EventArgs* e) { // event handler\n        wchar_t buf[1000]; \n        wsprintf(buf, L\"(%d, %d) clicked\", GET_X_LPARAM(e-&gt;lParam), GET_Y_LPARAM(e-&gt;lParam));\n        MessageBox(0, buf, L\"\", MB_OK);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here the problem is onLButtonUp's signature doesn't match since it's a class member function.<br>\nSo I tried to use boost::bind and I got compile error like this:    </p>\n\n<pre><code> Window::addMsgHandler': cannot convert parameter 2 'boost::_bi::bind_t&lt;R,F,L&gt;' to 'void (__cdecl *)(Window *,EventArgs *)'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which means I have to change (from simple function pointer to boost function object?) the signature of addMsgHandler() but </p>\n\n<p>I cannot determine the data type (with very long template parameters) to be passed.</p>\n\n<p>The compile error message says           </p>\n\n<pre><code>R=void,            \nF=boost::_mfi::mf2&lt;void,Form,Window *,EventArgs *&gt;,1&gt;                           \nL=boost::_bi::list3&lt;boost::_bi::value&lt;Form*&gt;,boost::arg&lt;1&gt;,boost::arg&lt;2&gt;&gt;                \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Furthermore, since many other classes will be derived from class Window, I cannot know the template type when I define class <em>Window</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a proper way to pass boost.bind object as function parameter?</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","winapi","version","rc"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":356,"score":1,"question_id":990308,"title":"Automatically increment the version number in a project's .rc file","body":"<p>How I can automatically increment the file version in my C/C++ project when I build it?\nCurrently I have to modify the resources manually before I do the build.\nIs there any script or utility to automate this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","windows","winapi","filesystems"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":512,"score":9,"question_id":8070224,"title":"Is there an alternative to the Windows FindFirstFile/FindNextFile API that doesn't search short file names?","body":"<p>I'm using the Windows API calls <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAA&amp;url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364418%28v=vs.85%29.aspx&amp;ei=kci6TtGwKqHq2QWa1ajCBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZdeD7Rk_PkGmVQosMyhgQ1lO16w&amp;sig2=XjQK3PSs7WVDzh2O8E82sw\">FindFirstFile</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBoQFjAA&amp;url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364428%28v=vs.85%29.aspx&amp;ei=38i6Tp-6EYGU2AWuirnDBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-eZr5AIhnTwM8nxgFow9m1AUReg&amp;sig2=eDfRsNM5RXQn909ihJFNeg\">FindNextFile</a> to search for files matching a certain wildcard string in a directory.

I've done that in my own WinForms apps to delightful effect.</p>\n\n<p>In WPF, I can also implement a similar <code>WndProc()</code> method and hook it to my WPF window's handle while extending the window frame into the client area, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// In MainWindow\n// For use with window frame extensions\nprivate IntPtr hwnd;\nprivate HwndSource hsource;\n\nprivate void Window_SourceInitialized(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        if ((hwnd = new WindowInteropHelper(this).Handle) == IntPtr.Zero)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Could not get window handle for the main window.\");\n        }\n\n        hsource = HwndSource.FromHwnd(hwnd);\n        hsource.AddHook(WndProc);\n\n        AdjustWindowFrame();\n    }\n    catch (InvalidOperationException)\n    {\n        FallbackPaint();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IntPtr WndProc(IntPtr hwnd, int msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, ref bool handled)\n{\n    switch (msg)\n    {\n        case DwmApiInterop.WM_NCHITTEST:\n            handled = true;\n            return new IntPtr(DwmApiInterop.HTCAPTION);\n\n        default:\n            return IntPtr.Zero;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that, since I'm blindly setting <code>handled = true</code> and returning <code>HTCAPTION</code>, clicking <em>anywhere</em> but the window icon or the control buttons causes the window to be dragged. That is, everything highlighted in red below causes dragging. This even includes the resize handles at the sides of the window (the non-client area). My WPF controls, namely the text boxes and the tab control, also stop receiving clicks as a result:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7J27H.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>What I want is for only</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the title bar, and</li>\n<li>the regions of the client area...</li>\n<li>... that aren't occupied by my controls</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>to be draggable. That is, I only want these red regions to be draggable (client area + title bar):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dhOoX.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>How do I modify my <code>WndProc()</code> method and the rest of my window's XAML/code-behind, to determine which areas should return <code>HTCAPTION</code> and which shouldn't? I'm thinking something along the lines of using <code>Point</code>s to check the location of the click against the locations of my controls, but I'm not sure how to go about it in WPF land.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT [4/24]:</strong> one simple way about it is to have an invisible control, or even the window itself, respond to <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code> by invoking <code>DragMove()</code> on the window (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5493149/how-do-i-make-a-wpf-window-movable-by-dragging-the-extended-window-frame/5773515#5773515\">Ross's answer</a>). The problem is that for some reason <code>DragMove()</code> doesn't work if the window is maximized, so it doesn't play nice with Windows 7 Aero Snap. Since I'm going for Windows 7 integration, it's not an acceptable solution in my case.</p>\n"},{"tags":["winapi","ip","latency","packets"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":133,"score":0,"question_id":3933573,"title":"IP packet / timeout / interval control","body":"<p>Without a novel, I'll try to explain and hope it makes sense.  </p>\n\n<p>We have an app that handles sending data to a server via simple HTTPS, no problem all works fine.  HOWEVER, if the packets are sent via a satellite phone, the latency of transmissions is a lot longer than the typical milliseconds handled on land-line high-speed network access.  So, the exact same packets being sent out are broken up automatically via Windows API when through the following functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DECLARE INTEGER InternetOpen IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER InternetCloseHandle IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER InternetConnect IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER HttpOpenRequest IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER InternetQueryOption IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER InternetSetOption IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER HttpSendRequest IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER HttpQueryInfo IN WININET.DLL\nDECLARE INTEGER InternetReadFile IN WININET.DLL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not specifically controlling the \"packets\", just building an entire request and sending it and get an answer.</p>\n\n<p>What APPEARS to be happening is this.  The packets are getting split into smaller chunks as typical with a large amount of data.  However, by the time the get to the satellite, they are NOT re-assembled in the correct sequence thus acceptance at the final destination fails.</p>\n\n<p>So, now the question...  Is there a way I can specifically let Windows know to slow down the frequency that packets are sent out to HELP prevent the latency issues?  Since we don't have access to the satellite system,  we can't prove this is the issue, but it appears they get the packets, just don't put them back together in the correct sequence.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows","winapi","pinvoke","dbghelp"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":601,"score":2,"question_id":4606628,"title":"Viewing export table on an unmanaged dll in C#","body":"<p>I am currently trying to create a C# application that will allow me to view the export table from an unmanaged DLL.

To find that well... trying to send a keyboard input to another non-foreground process is quite finicky and unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>I tried a method of SendInput where I trick the Z-order (to keep the current window on top) and quickly foreground the 3rd party window, send the input, and re-foreground my window. Of which ultimately failed, and also, somehow, not sure why, managed to also proc the keystrokes on my window as well while not foreground (causing an infinite loop of sending and receiving between two windows until I managed to close the process).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried different combinations of SendMessage and PostMessage. One for down, one for up, as using both for down and up leads to issues, like with PostMessage for both, causing the key to duplicate on the receiving window. or SendMessage for both, which caused issues with text entry, but other functions worked ok. SendMessage for keydown and PostMessage for keyUp worked for all functions, but the reliability rate dropped dramatically, as well as adding latency into key events. Only a combination of PostMessage for keydown, and SendMessage for keyup managed to do anything useful, with a maybe 5-10% fail rate of keyup registering.

The windows procedure is defined below as a global function, because you can't use a member function as a windows procedure. I dodge around this by making a global pointer (gasp) at the top, and assigning it to the this pointer of the system, which allows the procedure to call a member function procedure. Still only allows one instance of the system, but that's all i need :. Anywho, during shutdown, ShutdownWindows() is called, which then calls DestroyWindow. It is during this call, that my program simply ends, no error, no exception. MSVC++ express tells me it returns error code 3, but as far as windows error codes, that's just an ERROR_PATH_NOT_FIND which makes no sense in this context.

To begin, I have been scouring this and various other forums for answers to my 1784 error code and everything I've tried has failed.  Two of the threads I've checked on stackoverflow are <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6537416/writefile-returning-error-1784\">WriteFile returning error 1784</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11287901/blockwrite-i-o-error-1784\">BlockWrite I/O Error 1784</a>.  I've checked some others on this forum but I'm not remembering exactly what the are right now.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to save an array of structs to an empty binary file.  The first problem is that I get an access violation if my size variable (nNumberOfBytesToWrite parameter) is anything less about 99000 bytes.  That number jumps around.  For awhile when I was testing it would have the access violation if it was 99,999 bytes but not 100,000 bytes.  Of course, what I eventually want to do is set the size to the size of the entire array.  The original code to handle that is now commented out so I can test with various sizes.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing that happens (if I don't get an access violation) is I get error code 1784 and WriteFile fails every time.  As other threads on this topic have stated, this is defined on MSDN as ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER and the description is \"The supplied user buffer is not valid for the requested operation.\"  I've looked at MSDN's own example for opening files like this (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb540534%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb540534%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>) and have tried some variations based on their code, but nothing seems to work.</p>\n\n<p>This problem is probably massively noob and I'm sure I'm overlooking something ridiculously simple, but if anyone has suggestions they'd be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<pre><code>case IDM_SAVE1:\n{\n    HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(\"MineSave.mss\", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);\n    int test_buffer[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};\n\n    if(hFile != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)\n    {\n        BOOL bSuccess;\n        DWORD size = 100000; //DWORD size = (((sizeof(tile)) * tiles_total));\n        LPDWORD bytes_written = 0;\n        bSuccess = WriteFile(hFile, test_buffer, size, bytes_written, NULL);\n        if(bSuccess)\n        {\n            MessageBox(hwnd, \"File saved successfully.\", \"Great Job!\", MB_OK);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            DWORD error = GetLastError();\n            MessageBox(hwnd, \"Could not write to file.\", \"Error\", MB_OK);\n        }\n\n        CloseHandle(hFile);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        MessageBox(hwnd, \"Could not create file.\", \"Error\", MB_OK);\n    }\n}\nbreak;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["string","winapi","unicode","filenames","createfile"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":1,"question_id":12644150,"title":"How do I open a file named 𤭢.txt with CreateFile() API function?","body":"<p>Code points of some Unicode characters (like 𤭢) consume more than 2-bytes.

Then in\n  the non-elevated process, it may use\n  ShellExecute(Ex) to spawn an elevated\n  process for the real task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To do this from .net/powershell code, it looks like I'd have to do some elaborate P/Invoke stuff to call CreateProcessAsUser or CreateProcessWithLogonW since the .Net System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo doesn't have an equivalent of lpDesktop that I could set to \"winsta0\\default\". And I'm not clear on if LocalSystem even has the rights to call CreateProcessAsUser or CreateProcessWithLogonW.</p>\n\n<p>I also looked at\n<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alejacma/archive/2007/12/20/how-to-call-createprocesswithlogonw-createprocessasuser-in-net.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.msdn.com/alejacma/archive/2007/12/20/how-to-call-createprocesswithlogonw-createprocessasuser-in-net.aspx</a>\nand\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2313553/process-start-with-different-credentials-with-uac-on\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2313553/process-start-with-different-credentials-with-uac-on</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on all that, I'm reaching the conclusion that there's no straightforward way to do this. Am I missing something? This really doesn't seem like it should be so hard. It feels like UAC was just never designed to handle non-interactive use cases.</p>\n\n<p>And if any Microsoft people end up reading this, I noticed that the way ShellExecute internally handles elevation is by calling out to Application Information Service (AIS). Why isn't that same call to AIS available through some Win32 or .NET API?\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756945.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756945.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>Sorry that ran a bit long.

I am creating a window wrapper class, but <code>CreateDialogParam</code> needs a global dialog procedure, so I tried this workaround:</p>\n\n<p>I have done a bit of searching on this topic. I am making a <code>Dialog</code> class which I am subclassing to make a <code>CMainWnd</code> and then instantiating that. In the <code>Dialog</code> class I have a member function defined as <code>INT_PTR CALLBACK Dialog::cb_proc(HWND,UINT,WPARAM,LPARAM)</code>. Now, I know that windows must have a global function as a callback procedure.</p>\n\n<p>So I made a <code>std::map&lt;HWND,Dialog*&gt; DlgProcs</code> map to associate the dialogs window handle with its Dialog class pointer.</p>\n\n<p>And a <code>INT_PTR CALLBACK DlgMainProc(HWND,UINT,WPARAM,LPARAM)</code> so I could pass that to <code>CreateDialogParam()</code>. In the body of <code>DlgMainProc(...)</code> I search the map for using the <code>hWnd</code> parameter to find the <code>Dialog*</code> and return its <code>cb_proc(..)</code> member.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that none of the messages get processed, this is because the member procedure in my <code>Dialog</code> class never gets called. Even though when I put a <code>MessageBox()</code> in <code>DlgMainProc</code> inside a <code>if (DlgProcs.find(hWnd) != DlgProcs.end()) {</code> statement, the messagebox is displayed, over and over again until I have to abort the program from Visual Studio 2008. Which tells me that it is finding the <code>hWnd</code> in my map. The weird thing is it also does this if I put it in the <code>else</code> statement after that, which contradictingly tells me it is NOT finding the <code>hWnd</code> in the map.</p>\n\n<p>If I put a messagebox in the <code>cb_proc</code> member function it does not get displayed at all.

Yes I'm aware of the \"\\?\\\" unicode hack on some Win32 APIs, but it seems this hack is not without risk (as it's changing the behaviour of the way the APIs parse paths) and also isn't supported by all APIs .</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, let me just state my position/assertions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First presumably the only way the user was able to break this limit is if the app she used uses the special Unicode hack. It's a PDF file, so maybe the PDF tool she used uses this hack.</li>\n<li>I tried to reproduce this (by using the unicode hack) and experimented. What I found was that although the file appears in Explorer, I can do nothing with it. I can't open it, I can't choose \"Properties\" (Windows 7). Other common apps can't open the file (e.g. IE, Firefox, Notepad). Explorer will also not let me create files/dirs which are too long - it just refuses. Ditto for command line tool cmd.exe.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So basically, one could look at it this way: a rouge tool has allowed the user to create a file which is not accessible by a lot of Windows (e.g. Explorer). I could take the view that I shouldn't have to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, this isn't an vote of approval for a short max path length: I think 260 chars is a joke, I'm just saying that if Windows shell and some APIs can't handle > 260 then why should I?).</p>\n\n<p>So, is this a fair view? Should I say \"Not my problem\"?</p>\n\n<p><em>UPDATE:</em> Just had another user with the same problem. This time an mp3 file. Am I missing something?

I do not know how to manipulate the window using Winforms or use anything else from the .NET framework in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there some way to take a window created using the Win32 API and edit it using Winforms? Like, pass the window handle to my Form, edit it, and see the changes reflected in the window that has been created? Let me know if this doesn't make sense. It's been difficult for me to find much documentation on this, but maybe I'm just searching in the wrong places. If you could let me know of any resources that might help, or provide a nudge in the right direction, it would be appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["winapi","qt4","device","disk-partitioning"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":94,"score":0,"question_id":12478006,"title":"How get device harddisk partion information QT","body":"<p>I'am trying to get system information in a QT project, I want to know the hard disk partition in windows and the different properties of each partition so there is my code</p>\n\n<pre><code>QString drivename=QString(FileInfo.absolutePath().at(0))+\":\\\\\\\\\";\n    ULARGE_INTEGER freeBytesToCaller;\n    ULARGE_INTEGER TotalBytes;\n    ULARGE_INTEGER FreeBytes;\n    freeBytesToCaller.QuadPart = 0L;\n    TotalBytes.QuadPart = 0L;\n    FreeBytes.QuadPart = 0L;\n\n    if( !GetDiskFreeSpaceEx( drivename.toStdWString().c_str(), &amp;freeBytesToCaller,&amp;TotalBytes,&amp;FreeBytes ) )\n    {\n        qDebug() &lt;&lt;drivename&lt;&lt; \"ERROR: Call to GetDiskFreeSpaceEx() failed.\";\n\n    }\n   // qDebug()&lt;&lt;\"drive type of \"&lt;&lt;drivename&lt;&lt;\"  \"&lt;&lt;GetDriveTypeW(drivename.toStdWString().c_str());\n     int TotalBytes_gb = TotalBytes.QuadPart/(1024*1024*1024) ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it let me know the partion name (eg.

I nay agree to use other third-party libraries for graphics or change programming language!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","winapi","delete","folders"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":3,"question_id":12462178,"title":"Why doesn't this method of deleting files inside a folder work?","body":"<pre><code>std::wstring inxmpath ( L\"folder\" );\nHANDLE hFind;\nBOOL bContinue = TRUE;\nWIN32_FIND_DATA data;\nhFind = FindFirstFile(inxmpath.c_str(), &amp;data); \n// If we have no error, loop through the files in this dir\nint counter = 0;\nwhile (hFind &amp;&amp; bContinue) {\n        std::wstring filename(data.cFileName);\n        std::string fullpath = \"folder/\";\n        fullpath += (const char* )filename.c_str();\n        if(remove(fullpath.c_str())!=0) return error;\n    bContinue = FindNextFile(hFind, &amp;data);\n    counter++;\n}\nFindClose(hFind); // Free the dir\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't understand why it doesn't work, I think it has something to do with the conversions between wstring and string however I'm not sure about that.

When I did so at my school, on Windows XP, it played underneath the icons. When I tried at home, on Windows 7, it hid the icons. I'm not sure if it's the operating system or if it's an update of VLC, but I'm interested in playing it underneath the icons.</p>\n\n<p>After noticing this, I had an idea to make an animated desktop of sorts. Nothing special, just a few select videos for my own use. The idea I started with was to play a video in my own window (using <code>mciSendString</code>) and do a <code>PrintWindow</code> of each frame, save it to a file, and set the desktop wallpaper as the file. I've since lost the specific code, but it wasn't quite working, and, needless to say, would perform horribly. </p>\n\n<p>Coming back to it, I realized there must be a much more efficient way than that anyway, but I can't quite grasp what that is. </p>\n\n<p>I tried (all in Windows 7 now) setting the video's parent window to <code>GetDesktopWindow</code>, to the effect of minimizing all windows leaving behind a new window on the taskbar playing the video, but being able to see the desktop through clicking the aero peek button or hitting Win+D.</p>\n\n<p>I then tried the same with a parent window of the desktop's folder view window. The result was the same dimensioned window playing the video, but this time, the desktop could not be accessed, and no new window was created. It's like it was playing over top of most of the desktop, but the gadgets go over top and the areas toward the right and bottom still show due to the smaller playing window size. </p>\n\n<p>What does VLC do to play it on the desktop itself, looking as if it's a dynamic wallpaper? Is it significantly harder to make it play underneath the icons (and gadgets if you add in Windows 7, I suppose)? The program itself will be used on Windows XP. I'm not sure if DirectShow has anything that might help, but I'm willing to use it, among other Windows API areas besides just MCI. I'd prefer the solution to be in C++, if it makes a difference. .NET would also work well, but might take a bit of extra time working in.</p>\n"},{"tags":["winapi","windows-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":119,"score":0,"question_id":12398174,"title":"Stretching a desktop to 2 monitors in Windows 7","body":"<p>I am trying to stretch a desktop to two monitors using the ChangeDisplaySettingsEx function.

The characters in the QByteArray are preformatted specifically for the printer, the problem is, they contain several NULL bytes. When trying to send them to the printer, this causes TextOut to truncate the text, only printing the first few lines. Using WritePrinter, as suggested in the answer ignores null bytes and accepts a void * and a length, and just puts it all there.</p>\n\n<p>Further, his response recommending the use of PrintDlg did work to fectch the correct printer HDC, the issus is that, the user first chooses a printer once, and then doesn't need to choose it each time they print, because they will be printing alot (It's a Point of Sale).</p>\n\n<p>The problem with getting the printer HDC from the string name was due to not adding the all important NULL byte to wchar_* which was solved this way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>wchar_t * name = new wchar_t[this-&gt;m_printer_path.length()+1];\nthis-&gt;m_printer_path.toWCharArray(name);\nname[this-&gt;m_printer_path.length() + 1] = 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above, m_printer_path is a string representation of the name of the printer taken from Print Manager.</p>\n\n<p>Because the string has all the formatting necessary for the printer, there's no need to worry about new lines, or any formatting.</p>\n\n<p>All three answers to this question were actually very helpful in implementing the final working solution, and I have voted up each answer, and I appreciate the time each person took in responding.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","winapi"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12385163,"title":"FindResource() doesn't find my resource","body":"<p>I have some code template that i compiled, i would like to understand one part of the code that i am can't figure out what it does although i have spent a whole day tried to.</p>\n\n<p>the code in question is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define IDR_STUB 1\nhRsrc = FindResource(NULL, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_STUB), \"STUB\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have another two files in the same directory as the main file, the first one is called `something.rc' and is content is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define IDR_STUB 1\nIDR_STUB STUB DISCARDABLE \"stub.exe\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The other file as you can guess is <code>stub.exe</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is what is wrong with the <code>FindResource</code> call above that it can't find whatever is trying to find, I have hard time to understand how that function is suppose to work.</p>\n\n<p>So if you can give me some help i would be glad :)</p>\n\n<p>THX.</p>\n"},{"tags":["delphi","winapi","registry","delphi-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":91,"score":2,"question_id":12382289,"title":"Delphi - Using NtCreateKey with HKCU","body":"<p>and thanks for taking the time to look over my issue.</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to create a key inside HKCU using the native NtCreateKey API.</p>\n\n<p>I have a source that helps me to understand how the API works, but I cannot seem to make it work for HKCU, only HKLM...is this possible?</p>\n\n<p>Source Code I have already:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const\n   KeyNameBuffer: AnsiString = '\\Registry\\Machine\\SOFTWARE';

I, and you, have set SE_RESTORE_NAME in the process token. I should be allowed to arbitrarily set the owner SID. But it seems that I can't.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that any Deny on TakeOwnership DACLs overrides my ability to take ownership. However, I can't change permissions until I can take ownership! <em>sigh</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I might try setting SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege as you initially recommended, taking ownership to myself, changing permissions, setting ownership externally. What a pain.
