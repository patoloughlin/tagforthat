This is a stored procedure but I have set up it to handle the multi-valued parameter by passing it join(parameter, \"~\") and then separating it out in the stored proc.  This works on 5 other reports.  </li>\n<li>getReportInfoOnSelectedPerson: main body query; after the user selects the employee they want data on, this takes that personID and the date range and fills the main table. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem:<br>\nSSRS says viewOption doesn't exist.  But I see it, right there, in the Parameters folder on the left hand side.  I see it when I go to enter an expression under Parameters.  There is no squiggly red line under Parameters!viewOption.value.  But, when I try and put it as a value for a parameter used by the getListOfNames dataset, it errors.  If I put it in the getReportInfoOnSelectedPerson dataset and use it in the exact same way, SSRS is okay with that.  Wtf?  So... I have checked the rdl and everything is fine (where the actual parameter is declared, where it is used in the dataset reference, everything).  It's just this one dataset.  And I have a similar report that uses the same data set, same basic parameters and that report is fine.  I try setting the value of the dataset parameter to 1 or something and that is fine but when I try and set it to Parameter!viewOption.value it errors..... Now, above I said i normally pass the stored proc a Join on the paramater with a tilde ~ but I am trying to keep it simple and either get it to just work in general (either by passing it the first value of the multivalue viewOption parameter or turning that parameter into a single select and just passing the .value) but the join doesnt work either.  All of those things work for the other dataset, which is also a stored proc.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>This is my error:<br>\nAn error has occurred during report processing. (rsProcessingAborted)  The Value expression for the query parameter ‘@viewOption’ contains an error: The expression referenced a non-existing parameter in the report parameters collection. (rsRuntimeErrorInExpression)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Which is clearly saying my parameter doesn't exist but I can SEE it... everywhere.  And  if I assign one of the other datasets' parameter values to the viewOption parameter it works without an error.  I've checked the rdl.</p>\n\n<p>I've had this problem before and it was fixed by deleting both the parameter and dataset and creating them again (for safety I renamed both of them).  That didn't work this time.</p>\n\n<p>I am so frustrated.

We create the database during development automatically if they don't exist already using a DbContext Initializer (it's the <code>DropCreateDatabaseAlways</code> one). Often, whenever this happens and we try to connect to the database, we get the following error:</p>\n\n<p><code>Database 'C:\\\\www\\\\[old project]\\\\app\\\\Web\\\\App_Data\\\\[new project database name from connection string].mdf' already exists.

This is for simplicity and even because the size of this DBs is generally small.</p>\n\n<p>Now this works, anyway I would prefer to organize the DBs in a kind of Tree structure, so that I can force the PlugIn DBs to be \"sub-DBs\" of the main application DB.</p>\n\n<p>As a workaround I am thinking of using naming rules, like:</p>\n\n<p>ApplicationDB (for the main application DB)</p>\n\n<p>ApplicationDB_PlugIn_N (for the N-th plugin DB)</p>\n\n<p>When I search for plugin 1 I try to connect to ApplicationDB_PlugIn_1, if I don't find the DB i raise an error.

Can you comment on this self-made plugin approach I decribed above?</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDED INFO (AFTER STARTING THE BOUNTY):</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the MainDB I plan to store the connection info to all the plugin DBs. Basically it is the database name, since I deigned the sytem in a way that even if I use multiple sql server logins to access the MainDB, behind the scenes a single user (typically \"sa\" or another user with admin privileges).</p>\n\n<p>So basically if I need to query multiple databases I will use the database name to distinguish between plugins, I don't need to explicitly create fileds called PluginID in the database tables.</p>\n\n<p>So somehow it works like this, in the main DB I store the plugin DB names. So I know the name of the plugins, so if I want to query all the GUNS from all plugins i will do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_1.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\nunion\nselect * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_2.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\nunion\nselect * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_3.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so the \"trick\" is using the dbname to distinguish between plugins. Now this work, but it seems a little \"dirty\" to me. My question is \"IS THERE A BETTER APPROACH YOU CAN ENVISION?\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","tsql","sql-server-2000","sql-update"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2470,"score":1,"question_id":3867164,"title":"SQL update query syntax with inner join","body":"<p>Can anyone find my error in this query?

I get:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;FIELD attrname=\"TEXTTEST\" fieldtype=\"bin.hex\" SUBTYPE=\"\" SUBTYPE=\"WideText\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The attribute SUBTYPE appears twice when the correct is:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;FIELD attrname=\"TEXTTEST\" fieldtype=\"bin.hex\" SUBTYPE=\"WideText\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This problem only appears over a server; the others work OK. I don't know where the problem is, if it's Delphi, ADO, SQL Server.</p>\n\n<p>If I change the Web service to another computer using the same database, all works OK. I think that it is an ADO problem with the components installed on the computer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have the same problem with Windows 2003 Server computers. Two computers with MDAC 2.8 SP2 (ODBC components version 3.526) and both fails. I installed Microsoft SQLServer 2008 R2 to one of the computers and the problem is fixed. I need to know what is installed or reinstalled with SqlServer2008 to fix the problem. Apparently is related with ADO but now I have two machines with the same version of ADO and only one fails.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2005","tsql","truncate","foreign-keys"],"answer_count":13,"favorite_count":14,"up_vote_count":60,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77724,"score":60,"question_id":253849,"title":"Cannot truncate table because it is being referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint?","body":"<p>Using MSSQL2005, Can I truncate a table with a foreign key constraint if I first truncate the child table(the table with the primary key of the FK relationship)?</p>\n\n<p>I know I can use a DELETE without a where clause and then RESEED the identity OR</p>\n\n<p>Remove the FK, truncate and recreate but I thought as long as you truncate the child table you'll be OK however I'm getting a </p>\n\n<p>\"Cannot truncate table 'TableName' because it is being referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.\"</p>\n\n<p>error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":1,"question_id":13249054,"title":"Database calculations are wrong","body":"<p>Here is what I'm setting:</p>\n\n<pre><code>result = price / (case when tax = 0 then @tax1h / 100 else @tax2 / 100 end + 1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are the values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>price = 17.5\ntax = 1\ntax2 = 6\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>17.5 / (6 / 100 + 1) = 16.5</p>\n\n<p>And this returns 17.5 Why is this happening and how to solve it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","hbase","sqoop"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13248669,"title":"Sqoop free form query split by alias","body":"<p>I want to import data from MsSQL to HBase running a free form query which has an alias on the key I want to split by.

It seems that PHP is a widely used server-side language with JQM but I can't seem to find anything with good ol' CLASP (I know it's old tech, but it's similarities to PHP are quite interesting). I have a long history with classic asp and would like to use that as opposed to learning PHP (if I avoid it).</p>\n\n<p>Here are the details ...</p>\n\n<p>I have an existing SQL database (on my server) with customer information that I want to simply list in JQM. It would be a three page app:\nPage1 - Logon (user authentication)\nPage2 - customer listing based on the customers associated (in the database) with the user's credentials\nPage3 - customer details - details of the selected customer from Page2</p>\n\n<p>When the user submits the logon form, the app goes to the server and gets credentials. Those credentials are then used on Page2 to list the customers that have the user's ID as the account manager. The user then clicks a customer, and the customerID is passed to the customer details page which is used to pull specific customer data from the database.</p>\n\n<p>The main difficulties I am having are -\n. the connection the SQL server database. How does javascript connect to the server-side and retrieve data? AJAX, JSON, web service?\n. how do I pass data from page to page? Credentials from the logon form, customer ID to the customer details page.</p>\n\n<p>My preference would be to use ASP, with AJAX/JSON calls to populate the server-side data but I don't know where to start.

I have a need to specify the port number for my local installation of SQL Server 2008 R2. So far I've tried using the SqlConnectionStringBuilder with the data source set as <code>.\\TESTSERVER, 1433</code>, which by all the documentation should connect me to the server TESTSERVER on port 1433 (the default). </p>\n\n<p>The connection string looks like:</p>\n\n<p><code>{Data Source=\".\\TESTSERVER, 1433\";Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;User ID=testuser;Password=MYPASSWORDHERE}</code></p>\n\n<p>However I get an error that looks like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A network related or instance-specific error has occurred while establishing a connection SQL server.

(Provider: TCP provider, error:0 - no connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Upon verifying the connection string using <code>SqlConnectionStringBuilder.ToString()</code> it comes out almost how <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN</a> suggests. For some reason it wraps double quotes ONLY around the data source and nothing else. However this may just be the debugger removing the outside quotes since it's stored in a <code>string</code> datatype. I also verified that SQL server is accessible without specifying the port and it is. Finally, I verified that the server is allowed to accept remote connections. Considering this instance of SQL Server is installed locally, using the default port, and on my development computer I couldn't imagine why I would be getting an error like this.</p>\n\n<p>Is this because the SqlConnectionStringBuilder is overriding my port with it's own port? Do I need to for some reason open up ports on my firewall? Knowing it's a fully local installation it shouldn't be encountering firewall problems. I'd rather not have to manually build the connection string. Not that it's difficult, it just adds a layer of complexity to my code I'd rather not have unless needed.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a long hard digging through the SqlConnectionStringBuilder syntax it appears that it handles invalid parameters by passing then to the connection string surrounded in quotes.

But it also does not know what data was already sent to the central. Therefore it has to ask the central what is its the last available data.</p></li>\n<li><p>If I understand the <code>END CONVERSATION</code> correctly, the command causes sending only a kind of empty message <code>N'http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/EndDialog'</code>. Because of this, the central should probably send my type <code>ReplyMessage</code> with the answer back before the <code>END CONVERSATION</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Meanwhile, the satellite should probably do nothing to behave asychronously (i.e. waits after sending the <code>RequestMessage</code>). Once the <code>ReplyMessage</code> arrives, it activates a satellite procedure that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>receives the message and get the wanted information,</li>\n<li>receives the EndDialog message and ends the previous dialog at the satellite side, </li>\n<li>prepares the data to be sent to the central (the XML string form),</li>\n<li>opens the new dialog,</li>\n<li>sends the prepared data,</li>\n<li>and makes itself dormant until another <code>ReplyMessage</code> arrives.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The central should behave similarly. Once the <code>RequestMessage</code> arrives, it activates the central procedure that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>receives the request message, </li>\n<li>extracts the XML information and updates the central database,</li>\n<li>gets the info about the last available data for the satellite,</li>\n<li>forms and sends the <code>ReplyMessage</code>,</li>\n<li>ends the dialog at the central side.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So far, is my view correct?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now some details that I am not sure about:</strong> As I want to make it robust, working without a human touch, it should start on its own when the mechanism is installed. The communication should always be started by the satellite (the central may not know even if the satellite works or even exists).</p>\n\n<p>The satellite already uses a trigger fired by a raw data that is processed to build the records that are collected at the central. This way, the trigger could initiate somehow the first SSB request of the satellite to the central. But...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How the trigger can check that there is no pending communication between the satellite and the central? As the satellite is always the initiator, the question can also be formulated as... How the trigger can check whether the satellite waits for some <code>ReplyMessage</code>? Or, how to know that there is some open dialog between the satellite and the central?\n<ul>\n<li>If there is no conversation, the trigger forms the data record (stored in a local table), and then it could start the communication proces (see the point 1 above).</li>\n<li>If there is any conversation, the trigger only forms the record that is to be sent later, and nothing else is done. Data will be sent when the <code>ReplyMessage</code> is obtained by the activated procedure (see the point 3 above).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>On <em>making the satellite dormant</em> (see the last bullet of the point 3 above) I mean that there should probably be no other message in the message queue (nothing to be processed in the loop) and the activated procedure is to be naturally finished. But I am not sure if I think correctly here. Can you comment on that?</li>\n<li>If nothing is broken, and if the data is produced fast enough, the satellite and the central have always something to exchange. This way, the trigger should never try to start the communication.</li>\n<li>When there is nothing else to be sent to the central by the activated satellite procedure (actually, it is not active), or when the system is restarted somehow (no dialog exists yet), the trigger starts the communication process. But how could I do it? Should the trigger simply send the <code>RequestMessage</code> to the central? (This way the <code>ReplyMessage</code> would activate the satellite procedure and the procedure would continue until there is anything to process.)</li>\n<li>Say, the <code>RequestMessage</code> means <em>here is some data, process them, and reply what is the last</em> (or what next should be send or what next action is recommended from the central -- depends on the bussiness logic, probably not important here). Is it OK to send <em>empty XML</em> in the <code>RequestMessage</code> in the sense <em>I do not know what else you need -- tell me</em>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>First update</strong> -- based on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13198768/1346705\">the Remus Rusanu's answer below</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I have to agree that this would be <em>chatty</em> protocol. Moreover, the records are created as temperature samples from the real environment and the frequency of sampling is rather low. This means that the complicated protocol could be usefull only in the special case of restarting everything or so.</p>\n\n<p>But when the conversation should be left open <em>forever</em>, the unique identifier for the dialog handle or should be stored persistently in some configuration table, or it could even be hardwired to the code. The trigger will send the records on the fly immediately, and the central will simply not send the <code>ReplyMessage</code>. Is it correct? Can that kind of coversation be effectively considered a monolog?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second update</strong> to make this question reasonably short.</p>\n\n<p>See the continuation <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/13203389/1346705\">Service Broker: How should a trigger start infinitely opened dialog?</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","service-broker"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13203389,"title":"Service Broker: How should a trigger start infinitely opened dialog?","body":"<p>The question is a continuation of the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/13197781/1346705\">Service Broker: Designing the communication between two SQL servers</a> (to make the earlier reasonably short).</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the above question suggested the usage of a simpler scenario of sending the regularly generated data via <em>forever</em> opened dialog. A trigger, that is responsible for forming the data at the satellite SQL server and sending it do the central SQL server, will probably use the fixed unique identifier.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the conversation must be started at first. Say, the conversation handle is fixed. How can I detect the situation when the conversation was not open yet?</p>\n\n<p>If it is possible to detect the conversation was not started yet, I could combine the two approaches. The special request with empty-string message value could be send to the central, and the central would send back a reply only for that special request. The satellite activated procedure would then send the missing data to the central at once. </p>\n\n<p>Simply said, I have to solve the initial situation when quite a lot of data could be collected at the satellite machine. The satellite activated procedure could sent the data in chunks to give both sides a chance to do also something else than moving the data. Once the reply message from the central arrives in situation when there is nothing else to send, the activated procedure could set some persistent flag for the trigger to start sending the single records in a monolog way.

There's another button, that when clicked, will read the value from the \"LastSiteUsed\" session variable and display it in a label.</li>\n<li>In SQL, I created a new Database called dbSessionTest.

For example, when I click my button to save my session variable from Site1, I'd expect to be able to read that value from Site2, but it doesn't work. Site2 will only return \"Site2\" and Site1 will only return \"Site1\". </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas on what I could be doing wrong? Am I wrong in thinking that I should be able to read a value set by Site1 from Site2?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can see that session data is getting stored in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table in SQL Management Studio, but each site can still only see the value which it wrote. Both sites are setting the session variable like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Session(\"LastSiteUsed\") = \"Site2\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And both sites are retrieving the value like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lblValue.Text = \"Value from Session: \" &amp; Session(\"LastSiteUsed\").ToString\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do I need to do this differently for accessing session variables stored in SQL Server?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've tried using the default database, ASPState, which is created by running this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aspnet_regsql.exe -S MyServerName -E -ssadd -sstype p\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then simplified each of my Web.config files like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"20\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But again, no luck. I want to be able to set a session variable from Site1 and then read the value from Site2, but it's not working. Again, I'm able to see entries showing up in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table so I know they're getting entered correctly. One thing I noticed is they have different session IDs? </p>\n\n<p>Is there something I need to be doing differently to ensure the same session ID is used between my sites when setting/reading the same session variable?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've followed the instructions from <strong><a href=\"http://www.stionasoftware.com/Blogs/post/2010/10/27/Sharing-NET-Session-across-multiple-applications.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a></strong> which modifies an SP and adds a column for grouping to the <code>ASPStateTempApplications</code> table. This <em>kind of</em> worked, but only if both of my sites were open in the same browser (using tabs). I need to be able to open Site1 in IE, save a value to my session variable, close the browser, open Site2 in Chrome, and read the value. From everything I've read with SQL Server Session State... this should be possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4 - SOLUTION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I followed the answer on <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2868316/sharing-sessions-across-applications-using-the-asp-net-session-state-service/3151315#3151315\">this article</a></strong> provided by @SilverNinja. I re-created the <code>ASPState</code> database via the command prompt (to undo my SP changes in Update #3) and then modified the <code>TempGetAppID</code> SP as per the answer from the link. I've also updated both of my Web.config files to match the answer from that article as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\"\n              sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword;Application Name=CacheTest\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also included identical Machine Keys in both Web.config files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;machineKey validationKey=\"59C42C5AB0988049AB0555E3F2128061AE9B75E3A522F25B34A21A46B51F188A5C0C1C74F918DFB44C33406B6E874A54167DFA06AC3BE1C3FEE8506E710015DB\" decryptionKey=\"3C98C7E33D6BC8A8C4B7D966F42F2818D33AAB84A81C594AF8F4A533ADB23B97\" validation=\"SHA1\" decryption=\"AES\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I am able to (using IE) open up both of my sites, set a value from Site1, and read it from Site2 (and vice versa).

And also, if the app wants to show price listings, it does simple <code>SELECT * FROM PRICE_LISTING</code> that includes product names and price.</p>\n\n<p>One approach might be to add surrogate keys - <code>ID</code> identity columns to each table, then modify for example <code>PRICE_LISTING</code> table to (<code>PRODUCT_ID, price</code>) etc. But then, to show price, I'd have to define view that will </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT *,PRODUCT.NAME,PRODUCT.CATEGORY,PRODUCT.SHORTNAME FROM PRICE_LISTING join PRODUCT on ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then, the automatically generated DataSets etc. will have to be modified to select from view, update the view.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell and from the original author's perspective, we are breaking the program and making it more complicated. The only single thing that does not work when ported in a straightforward manner is the cascading update, but I see that the database design is very flawed and it will be a maintenance nightmare if not fixed.</p>\n\n<p>What to do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","sql-server","database","tsql"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":13117710,"title":"How to export all words from sql table or sql database","body":"<p>Let's say we have following table.</p>\n\n<pre>\nUserId | Message\n-------|-------------\n1      | Hi, have a nice day\n2      | Hi, I had a nice day\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>I need to have all { Hi,-have-a-nice-day-I-had } words separately.\nIs there any way to do that ?

Been banging my head against the wall for quite some time on this.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise is it a case of just using loops and bearing with the execution time?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","sql-server"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13104356,"title":"Display varbinary as a downloadable link","body":"<p>Fairly straightforward question, I have images stored in my database as varbinary and would like to provide a link to these images rather than displaying them on the website.

Here's an example of what I've got so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyUserSeeder : IEntitySeeder {\n    public void InitializeEntities(AssessmentSystemContext context, SqlConnection connection) {\n        context.MyUsers.Add(new MyUser { MyUserId = 106, ConceptPersonId = 520476, Salutation = \"Mrs\", Firstname = \"Novelette\", Surname = \"Aldred\", Email = null, LoginId = \"520476\", Password=\"28c923d21b68fdf129b46de949b9f7e0d03f6ced8e9404066f4f3a75e115147489c9f68195c2128e320ca9018cd711df\", IsEnabled = true, SpecialRequirements = null });\n        try {\n            connection.Open();\n            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(\"SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[MyUser] ON\", connection);\n            int retVal = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\n            context.SaveChanges();\n        }\n        finally {\n            connection.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So close and yet so far - because, although <code>cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()</code> works fine, when I then run <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, I'm informed that \"Explicit value must be specified for identity column in table 'MyUser' either when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to ON or when a replication user is inserting into a NOT FOR REPLICATION identity column.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, because MyUserId (which is the Identity column in the MyUser table) is the primary key, entity framework doesn't try to set it when I call <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, even though I gave the <code>MyUser</code> entity a value for the <code>MyUserId</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to force entity framework to try and insert even primary key values for an entity, then?  Or maybe a way to temporarily mark <code>MyUserId</code> as not being a primary key value, so EF tries to insert it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008-r2"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":1,"question_id":13101414,"title":"Identity column and using order by in query","body":"<p>I use SQL Server 2008 R2 and have a table with an <code>id</code> column as <code>identity(1,1)</code>.

I may have left out some important information -- I'm interacting with the database through an ODBC connection. In addition to CREATE statements, there seem to be other statements that don't work. For instance, I can't seem to use DECLARE in one statement to define a variable that will be used in another statement. As near as I can figure, I have to put everything into a single SELECT statement (although WITH also seems to work for declaring common tables). Unfortunately, all of the solutions suggested so far seem to require variable declarations outside the SELECT statement, and that isn't working.

So I return (4 - 99) = 103</p>\n\n<p>If there's a better way, I don't mind changing but I really like this query.</p>\n\n<p>If there's really no other way and I can't simulate a row number in access, i will use the pass through query.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you </p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","sql-server-2008","tsql","pivot"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":3,"question_id":13072744,"title":"SQL Server PIVOT with multiple X-axis columns","body":"<p>Take the following example data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Payroll Forname Surname Month   Year    Amount\n0000001 James   Bond    3       2011    144.00\n0000001 James   Bond    6       2012    672.00\n0000001 James   Bond    7       2012    240.00\n0000001 James   Bond    8       2012    1744.50\n0000002 Elvis   Presley 3       2011    1491.00\n0000002 Elvis   Presley 6       2012    189.00\n0000002 Elvis   Presley 7       2012    1816.50\n0000002 Elvis   Presley 8       2012    1383.00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How would i PIVOT this on the Year + Month (eg: 201210) but preserve Payroll, Forename &amp; Surname as seperate columns, for example, the above would become:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Payroll Forename    Surname 201103  201206  201207  201208\n0000001 James       Bond    144.00  672.00  240.00  1744.50\n0000002 Elvis       Presley 1491.00 189.00  1816.50 1383.00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm assuming that because the Year + Month names can change then i will need to employ dynamic SQL + PIVOT - i had a go but couldnt even get the code to parse, nevermind run - any help would be most appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: What i have so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    INSERT  INTO #tbl_RawDateBuffer\n            ( PayrollNumber ,\n              Surname ,\n              Forename ,\n              [Month] ,\n              [Year] ,\n              AmountPayable\n            )\n            SELECT  PayrollNumber ,\n                    Surname ,\n                    Forename ,\n                    [Month] ,\n                    [Year] ,\n                    AmountPayable\n            FROM    RawData\n            WHERE   [Max] &gt; 1500\n\n\nDECLARE @Columns AS NVARCHAR(MAX)\nDECLARE @StrSQL AS NVARCHAR(MAX) \n\nSET @Columns = STUFF((SELECT DISTINCT\n                                ',' + QUOTENAME(CONVERT(VARCHAR(4), c.[Year]) + RIGHT('00' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(2), c.[Month]), 2))\n                      FROM      #tbl_RawDateBuffer c\n    FOR              XML PATH('') ,\n                         TYPE \n            ).value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)'), 1, 1, '') \n\nSET @StrSQL = 'SELECT PayrollNumber, ' + @Columns + ' from \n            (\n                select PayrollNumber\n                    , CONVERT(VARCHAR(4), [Year]) + RIGHT(''00'' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(2), [Month]), 2) dt\n                from #tbl_RawDateBuffer\n           ) x\n            pivot \n            (\n                sum(AmountPayable)\n                for dt in (' + @Columns + ')\n            ) p '\n\n\nEXECUTE(@StrSQL)\n\nDROP TABLE #tbl_RawDateBuffer\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":13073105,"title":"Case statement with 'OR' statement","body":"<pre><code>SELECT   ProductNumber, Category =\n      CASE ProductLine\n         WHEN 'R' or 'r' THEN 'Road'\n         WHEN 'M' or 'm' THEN 'Mountain'\n         WHEN 'T' or 't' THEN 'Touring'\n         WHEN 'S' or 's' THEN 'Other sale items'\n         ELSE 'Not for sale'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My basic requirement is to use 'OR' with CASE (if possible) , Please suggest if i am doing anything wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008","tsql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13071566,"title":"Derived Tables vs. Correlated subquery in HAVING clause SQL Server 2008","body":"<p>In this example I've only got two tables with which I'm working.

<strong>MagazinePages</strong> based on above example I can create sub menus for  “About Us” &amp; Multimedia how can i design my database so that i can pull data from different table such as <strong>news</strong> by category (Politics, Culture...) &amp; Issue from <strong>Magazine</strong> Table (Issue 101, Issue 102, Issue 103....)</p>\n\n<p>I am planning to use ASP Menu control for this which may not be very flexible, since i will have over 100 issue of magazine how or which multi column menu i can use with asp.net </p>\n\n<p>My database may have many flows, I would appreciate help in this regard so that i can use this database for this CMS system . Please feel free to ask question if any regarding this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added</strong>:\nIf i need to pull all the menu name from <code>MagazinePages</code> Table then it is easy but i have been asked to have a menu structure as shown in the example. Problem with this is i can generate menus for <code>AboutUs</code> &amp; <code>Multimedia</code> from <code>MagazinePages</code> Table but i dont have any pages like Politics, Economic, ... Issue 101, 102, 103.. in this Table as that information is stored in different table like <code>News Category</code> in News Table &amp; Issue in <code>Magazine</code> table.  I would rather change my table design &amp; make it flexible to read menu information from separate table but i am not sure how</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schema Updated</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mvbwq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>News Table is not show in this Schema.</p>\n\n<p>What i have done is that i have created ps_Pages Table for CMS Pages like, Home, Aboutus, Contact, MediaCentre .....</p>\n\n<p>I store Pages related to Magazine (Which actually are article with different category or tags like culture, politics, sports, people ...) in <code>art_Article</code> table</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","sql","sql-server"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13067018,"title":"Comparing date range quarters sql server","body":"<p>I have a policies in a system</p>\n\n<pre><code>PolRef       Start            End\nPOL123     22/11/2012      23/12/2014\nPOL212     24/09/2012      23/10/2012\nPOL214     23/08/2012      29/09/2012\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am asking a user for a reporting date, the user enters 24/10/2012 this becomes <code>@StartDate</code></p>\n\n<p>From this I derive what the quarter is by the month:</p>\n\n<pre><code>set @currentMonth = Month(@StartDate)\n\nif @currentMonth = 1 or @currentMonth = 2 or @currentMonth = 3 begin set @startmonth = 1 set @endmonth = 3 end\n\nif @currentMonth = 4 or @currentMonth = 5 or @currentMonth = 6 begin set @startmonth = 4 set @endmonth = 6 end\n\nif @currentMonth = 7 or @currentMonth = 8 or @currentMonth = 9 begin set @startmonth = 7 set @endmonth = 9 end\n\nif @currentMonth = 10 or @currentMonth = 11 or @currentMonth = 12 begin set @startmonth = 10 set @endmonth = 12 end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then get a date range:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@quarterStartDate = CAST(CAST(YEAR(@StartDate) AS varchar) + '-' + CAST(@startMonth AS varchar) + '-' + '01') AS Date)\n\n@quarterEndDate = CAST(CAST(YEAR(@EcdDate) AS varchar) + '-' + CAST(@endMonth AS varchar) + '-' + '31') AS Date)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will give me 01-10-2012 and 31-12-2012.

I am trying to write a stored procedure that will import any of these CSV files, using a number of parameters to set things like file name, destination name etc.</p>\n\n<p>Simple so far. The problem comes because of the structure of this DB. Each data table has a number of (usually 5) columns that are of a set format, and then however many data columns you want. There are then a set of data validation tables that contain specific sets of values that these 5 columns can contain. So the problem is, is that when I do the import from CSV, I need to validate that each row that is imported meets the criteria in these validation tables, essentially that there is a row in the validation table that has data that matches the 5 columns in the imported data.</p>\n\n<p>If it does not, then it needs to write an error to the log and not import it, if it does then it should import it.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of what I mean:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Table (where the imported data will go)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>|datatype|country|currency| datacolumn1 | datacolumn|\n|1       | 2     |  GBP   | 10000       | 400       |\n|3       | 4     |  USD   | 10000       | 400       |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Validation table</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>|datatype|country|currency|\n|1       |2      |GBP     |\n|2       |3      |USD     |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the first line is valid, it has a matching record in the validation table for the first 3 columns, but the second is not and should be rejected.</p>\n\n<p>The added problem is that each table can reference a different validation table (although many reference the same one) so the columns that have to be checked often vary in amount and name.</p>\n\n<p>My first problem is really how to do a row by row check when importing from CSV, is there any way to do so without importing into a temporary table first?\nAfter that, what is the best way to check that the columns match, in a generic way despite that fact that the name and number of columns change depending on what table is being imported.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","sql-server-2008","sql-server-2008-r2","sql-management-studio"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":0,"question_id":13037863,"title":"Clarification as to why EXECUTE AS USER/LOGIN is not returning the expected results?","body":"<p>I am running the following query against a database:</p>\n\n<pre><code>execute as user = 'domain\\username'\nselect * from fn_my_permissions(null, 'DATABASE')\norder by subentity_name, permission_name\nrevert;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the following error gets thrown:</p>\n\n<p><code>Cannot execute as the database principal because the principal \"dev\\spadmin\" does not exist, this type of principal cannot be impersonated, or you do not have permission.</code></p>\n\n<p>The user is the dbo of the database, and when I open up the properties in management studio, I can see that it is associated with that login.

I work on a school project and there is quite complicated database containing energy consumption data. Those I need (<code>I</code> import, <code>E</code> export, reactive power <code>C</code> and <code>L</code>) are stored in one column as binary compressed so to get them out I have to use a stored procedure which calls some methods in custom assembly to decompress the column and restore the data.</p>\n\n<p>The stored procedure has 4 arguments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@identify int,\n@startTime datetime,\n@endTime datetime,\n@args nvarchar(60) -- \"Selector\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>selector</code> is rather special, it's an argument where you specify what you want in the result set, e.g. <code>'i'</code> for Import column only, <code>'i,e'</code> for Import and Export. They designed it like this because it's faster if you need just one column rather then all columns (because of the way the compressed data are stored).</p>\n\n<p>So, I've created an ADO.NET Entity Model called <code>EnergyConsumptionDBModel</code>, imported the stored procedure and created complex type <code>EnergyConsumptionResult</code> for the stored procedure return type as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class EnergyConsumptionResult\n{\n    public System.DateTime Time { get; set; }\n    public double I { get; set; }\n    public double E { get; set; }\n    public double L { get; set; }\n    public double C { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The column <code>Time</code> is always present in the result set, but the rest depends on the <code>@args</code> argument of the stored procedure. For example if I pick <code>'i,e,c,l'</code> as an argument, it will return columns <code>Time, I, E, C, L</code> and everything is just fine but if I pick for example <code>'i'</code> it returns <code>Time, I</code> which gives me an exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The data reader is incompatible with the specified 'EnergyConsumptionDBModel.EnergyConsumptionResult'.</em><br>\n  <em>A member of the type, 'E', does not have a corresponding column in the data reader with the same name.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the question is, is there some simple way to solve this? Some kind of dynamic result mapping on complex type or is it much more simple to tell my colleague who designed the stored procedure to make it return all columns whatever is in <code>@args</code> but leave the un-used columns empty which is a solution my project leader may not like.

This is known as <a href=\"http://www.sommarskog.se/query-plan-mysteries.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">parameter sniffing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem we have with our database is that SQL Server sometimes builds these plans based on parameters that point to a smaller tenant, which works fine for that tenant, but then when it reapplies the cached plan to a larger tenant it fails catastrophically (usually timing out, in fact). Typically we find out about this situation only when one of our larger tenants contacts us about experiencing time-out errors, then we have to get into the system and manually flush all the query plans to correct it.</p>\n\n<p>There is a query hint you can use to prevent SQL Server from caching query plans (<a href=\"http://www.benjaminnevarez.com/2010/06/how-optimize-for-unknown-works/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN</code></a>) but this results in some extra overhead since the query plan is being regenerated every time the query is called. An additional problem is that we're using Entity Framework which offers no ability to specify the <code>OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN</code> hint on queries.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is -- what is the best practice for multi-tenant databases with regard to parameter sniffing? Is there a way to disable parameter sniffing database-wide without having to specify it on every query? If so, is that even the best approach? Should I be partitioning the data in some other way?

Basically, I would want to calculate the average using the last point of every day except the last one, which would use a different point in time in the middle of the day.  If I was to do a moving average from day 1 to day 10, ending at noon of the 10th day (HourId 12), the data I would use for my calculation would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DayId HourId Value\n1     24     80\n2     24     90\n3     24     39\n4     24     60\n...   ...    ...\n9     24     10 \n10    12     30\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In SQL, I could retrieve a set like this pretty easily:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT \n    *\nFROM\n    [FactTable]\nWHERE\n    ((DayId BETWEEN 1 AND 9) AND (HourId = 24))\n    OR ((DayId = 10) AND (HourId = 12))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm pretty new to OLAP and MDX, so I've really been struggling with the right way to do this.  So far, the best I've been able to do is to perform a sub-select in my <code>FROM</code> clause, and essentially construct a tuple set of only the rows I want:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WITH\n    MEMBER [SMA 10 Value] AS\n    AVG (\n        ([Time].[DayId].Lag(9):[Time].[DayId], [Time].[HourId])\n        , [Value]\n    )\nSELECT\n    {\n      [Value]\n      , [SMA 10 Value]\n    } ON COLUMNS\n    , ([Time].[DayId], [Time].[HourId]) ON ROWS\nFROM\n(\n    SELECT\n        [Measures] ON COLUMNS\n        , {\n            ([Time].[DayId].[1]:[Time].[DayId].[9], [Time].[HourId].[24])\n            , ([Time].[DayId].[10], [Time].[HourId].[12])\n    } ON ROWS\n    FROM\n        [Cube]\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, it doesn't seem to quite work right for my calculations.  The moving average seems to be correct over the first 9 days, because their tuples all have the same hour ID, but when I get to the final day, instead of using the values from the previous 9 tuples, it performs the average over the previous 9 days with the 12 Hour ID.</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong here, is there a better way that I can filter my time dimension down to eliminate unwanted rows from my calculations?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","stored-procedures","timer","return"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":102,"score":5,"question_id":12996705,"title":"SQL Server stored procedure that returns processed records number","body":"<p>I have a Winforms application that executes a stored procedure which examines several rows (around 500k).

It was mostly with regard to reducing code repetition for transaction management, error handling, and security. But I have researched it since and cannot find it anywhere. Perhaps I don't know what it is called so I will explain.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I have a simple table (forget its relationships, just a single table). I have at least 5 possible operations I can do on it namely CRUD, with the R being read the details of one row, or read a list of rows for a given criteria. Again, let's not get into too much detail with complicated stored procedures and let's pretend, for this example, we want nothing but the following 5 operations to be performed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create (simple insert)</li>\n<li>Read (one for reading a single row)</li>\n<li>Read multiple (reading a list of rows, simple <code>select * from sometable where some condition</code>, nothing complicated), </li>\n<li>Update (simple update)</li>\n<li>Delete (again, simple delete). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this example, a simple table with 2 or 3 columns, and the most simple procedures you can come up with to do those operations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>My lecturer, when talking to us about transactions, advised us to take these simple procedures, and keep them separate as is normal. But then to write a master procedure which executes each of these. This means we have a master procedure into which we pass a character lets say 'C' for create and so on, and a series of conditions which decide which job to run. Of course, we should pass in the details needed from the master to the child proc which means we need to get them from the user as parameters. This master procedure is already beginning to sound complicated.</p>\n\n<p>His reasoning, do the transaction handling, validation, error handling, and security handling in the master procedure.

Now imagine another level which if you have several tables to operate on, will decide which sub master to call, and this MasterMaster for want of a better name must have external parameters for every field in every table. However, the validation, security, and transaction code would be moved up to that level instead.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, is that the way a professional would do it. And finally, I am using MVC with entity framework. Suppose I have a database like this (I have), and access is only allowed through this master stored procedure (it is). How do I call such a stored procedure from within EF and MVC. Even better, how would I bypass EF all together and get the data into my controller in a way my view will understand. I know how to do this with ASP.Net code behind. But not in MVC.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions. Please, feel free to tell me that this is completely crazy as it seems like a hell of a lot of work (what if you have 50 tables (I do). Imagine, 5 simple operations, across 50 tables = 250 child stored procedures + 50 Sub-Sub-Masters, + 5 Sub-Masters + 1 Master. I have my work cut out. Is there a tool that can do this or at least generate a template for me?</p>\n\n<p>So to summarise, My questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this overly complicated or is this the professional way to do this?</li>\n<li>What is the term used to describe this Master / child procedural relationship.</li>\n<li>Is there a tool that can automate this process.</li>\n<li>Is there a tool that can help me generate some kind of boilerplate template.</li>\n<li>How can I use this procedure with EF and MVC</li>\n<li>How can I bypass EF altogether and just find a way to call the procedure directly.</li>\n<li>Is there anything like the equivalent of classes, or even methods in T-SQL which can structure this much like a standard piece of code. Meaning that each child procedure is a method, each table has its properties, and the constructor will be the the initial (or altered) representation of the object.</li>\n<li>If 7 does exist, which would be more standard, the way I described (i.e.) splitting everything up, or the idea in 7.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With regard to this point 4 I am talking about something simple, like the one already in SQL Server where you right click a procedure and choose execute and it generates some simple code for testing your procedure, or like the one for making functions.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this and for any help you can offer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","tsql","vbscript","ssms","adodb"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":12979025,"title":"SSMS is fast than Provider=SQLNCLI.1","body":"<p>I am using SQL native client in VB script to execute a query.<br>\nConnection string is   </p>\n\n<pre><code>ConCI.Open(\"Provider=SQLNCLI.1;Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=False;Initial Catalog=\" &amp; CIDBName &amp; \";Data Source=\" &amp; CIServerName)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Query is   </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM statementheader WITH (nolock)\nWHERE statementdate &gt;=\n(\n    SELECT procdayend-1 \n    FROM\n    ARSystemAccounts\n) \nAND currentbalance &lt;= 0 \nAND dateoftotaldue IS NOT NULL\nAND systemstatus &lt;&gt; 14\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>SSMS takes 50 to 60 seconds to execute this query but VB script takes ages.<br>\nWhy is it so  and what should I do ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server",".net-3.5","scheduled-tasks"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":265,"score":1,"question_id":3135361,"title":"Scheduling tasks Advice? .Net, SQL Job?","body":"<p>I am creating a system where users can setup mailings to go out at specific times.

Each parallel bulk insert needs its own copy, with the same constraints as the main table to allow switching.</p>\n\n<p>So far I've hit several walls trying to get around this bottleneck:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I tried partitioning the working table using the same partition\nfunction. This doesn't work because you can't disable the indexes on\na partition basis to insert into one while rebuilding the index on\nanother. </li>\n<li>Creating a temporary table as the working table. This\ndoesn't work because, while you can use the same index names, you\ncan't easily dynamically create the constraints and can't switch\nthat in anyway. </li>\n<li>Have a fixed set of named working tables?

This is achieved pretty easily with a <code>CASE</code> statement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WITH MEMBER [C] AS\n    CASE\n        WHEN ISEMPTY([A]) THEN [B]\n        ELSE [A]\n    END\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works great, and running the following query displays the results exactly like I would expect them to be displayed, where <code>[C]</code> is <code>[B]</code> only when <code>[A]</code> is empty.</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\n    { [A]\n    , [B]\n    , [C]\n    } ON COLUMNS\n    , [Time].CHILDREN ON ROWS\nFROM    \n    [Cube]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However,  there are some cases where both <code>[A]</code> and <code>[B]</code> are empty, and I would like to filter them out of the result set.  Normally, I would be able to just wrap the <code>[Time]</code> dimension in <code>NONEMPTY</code> to achieve this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\n    { [A]\n    , [B]\n    , [C]\n    } ON COLUMNS\n    , NONEMPTY([Time].CHILDREN) ON ROWS\nFROM    \n    [Cube]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But when I try this with the above query, the results filter out all of the rows where <code>[A]</code> is empty, regardless of whether or not <code>[B]</code> is empty.  Rows where <code>[B]</code> is empty are not filtered out.</p>\n\n<p>I would expect that NONEMPTY would either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Filter out only rows where <code>[C]</code> is empty (<code>[A]</code> and <code>[B]</code> are empty) <strong>OR</strong></li>\n<li>Filter out all rows where <code>[A]</code> OR <code>[B]</code> is empty</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why is <code>NONEMPTY</code> only taking <code>[A]</code> in to account here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":12977598,"title":"limit select based on group","body":"<p>What I have is 2 tables.  table A looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>actID; jobnumber; actTypeID; completeDate\n1;    2000;       3;      2012-09-04\n2;    2000;       4;      2012-09-05\n3;    2001;       2;      2012-09-10\n4;    2001;       4;      2012-09-05\n5;    2001;       5;      2012-09-05\n6;    2002;       1;      2012-09-12\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Table B looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>actTypeID;  actType;  projStatus;\n1;     Pick;    Build;\n2;     Bid;     Estimate;\n3;     PMQC;    QC;\n4;     Equipment Test;    QC;\n5;     Assembly;    Build;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I need to do is include the <code>projStatus</code> and <code>actType</code> in this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT jobnumber,\n    max(completedate) completedate\nFROM tableA\nGROUP BY jobnumber\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>without increasing the number of records returned, ie get this set back:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jobnumber; actType; projStatus; completedate;\n2000;  EquipmentTest; QC;       2012-09-05;\n2001;  Bid;           Estimate; 2012-09-10;\n2002;  Pick;          Build;    2012-09-12;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm on SQL server 2005 right now, soon to be 2008.

Let's call them Orders and Items. Order has a Primary key of OrderId and Items has a Primary Key of ItemId. Items.OrderId  is the foreign key to identify the parent Order. An Order can have 1 to n Items.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to provide a very flexible \"query builder\" type interface to the user to allow the user to select what Items he want to see. The filter criteria can be based on fields from the Items table and/or from the parent Order table. If an Item meets the filter condition including and condition on the parent Order if one exists, the Item should be return in the query as well as the parent Order.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, I suppose, most people would construct a join between the Item table and the parent Order tables.  I would like to perform 2 separate queries instead. One to return all of the qualifying Items and the other to return all of the distinct parent Orders. The reason is two fold and you may or may not agree.</p>\n\n<p>The first reason is that I need to query all of the columns in the parent Order table and if I did a single query to join the Orders table to the Items table, I would be repoeating the Order information multiple times. Since there are typically a large number of items per Order, I'd like to avoid this because it would result in much more data being transfered to a fat client. Instead, as mentioned, I would like to return the two tables individually in a dataset and use the two tables within to populate a custom Order and child Items client objects. (I don't know enough about LINQ or Entity Framework yet. I build my objects by hand). The second reason I would like to return two tables instead of one is because I already have another procedure that returns all of the Items for a given OrderId along with the parent Order and I would like to use the same 2-table approach so that I could reuse the client code to populate my custom Order and Client objects from the 2 datatables returned.</p>\n\n<p>What I was hoping to do was this:</p>\n\n<p>Construct a dynamic SQL string on the Client which joins the orders table to the Items table and filters appropriate on each table as specified by the custom filter created on the Winform fat-client app. The SQL build on the client would have looked something like this:</p>\n\n<p>TempSQL = \"</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO #ItemsToQuery\n   OrderId, ItemsId\nFROM\n   Orders, Items \nWHERE\n   Orders.OrderID = Items.OrderId AND\n   /* Some unpredictable Order filters go here */\n  AND\n   /* Some unpredictable Items filters go here */\n\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I would call a stored procedure, </p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE GetItemsAndOrders(@tempSql as text)\n   Execute (@tempSQL) --to create the #ItemsToQuery table\n\nSELECT * FROM Items WHERE Items.ItemId IN (SELECT ItemId FROM #ItemsToQuery)\n\nSELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Orders.OrderId IN (SELECT DISTINCT OrderId FROM #ItemsToQuery)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that #ItemsToQuery table, since it was created by dynamic SQL, is inaccessible from the following 2 static SQLs and if I change the static SQLs to dynamic, no results are passed back to the fat client.</p>\n\n<p>3 around come to mind but I'm look for a better one:</p>\n\n<p>1) The first SQL could be performed by executing the dynamically constructed SQL from the client. The results could then be passed as a table to a modified version of the above stored procedure. I am familiar with passing table data as XML. If I did this, the stored proc could then insert the data into a temporary table using a static SQL that, because it was created by dynamic SQL, could then be queried without issue. (I could also investigate into passing the new Table type param instead of XML.) However, I would like to avoid passing up potentially large lists to a stored procedure.</p>\n\n<p>2) I could perform all the queries from the client. </p>\n\n<p>The first would be something like this:</p>\n\n<p>SELECT Items.* FROM Orders, Items WHERE Order.OrderId = Items.OrderId AND (dynamic filter)\nSELECT Orders.* FROM Orders, Items WHERE Order.OrderId = Items.OrderId AND (dynamic filter)</p>\n\n<p>This still provides me with the ability to reuse my client sided object-population code because the Orders and Items continue to be returned in two different tables.</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling to, that I might have some options using a Table data type within my stored proc, but that is also new to me and I would appreciate a little bit of spoon feeding on that one.</p>\n\n<p>If you even scanned this far in what I wrote, I am surprised, but if so, I woul dappreciate any of your thoughts on how to accomplish this best.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","tsql","full-text-search","temporary-tables"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":660,"score":0,"question_id":4847057,"title":"TSQL - Optimizing Full Text Search query with temp table","body":"<p>To make it short I have a full text search query that does a company search on a single table.
