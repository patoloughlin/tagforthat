I typed alot but I really need help so I figured I would try and provide as much info about the problem as I could right from the start.      </p>\n\n<p>Let's simplify it all and pretend these are the relevant names of everything and that the report gets basic employee information:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Parameters\n<ul>\n<li>facilityID: text in the format of a guid or uniqueidentifier, this is hidden and passed in so that the end user of the report can only view info for their own facility;  Single valued parameter, not blank not null, hidden, text</li>\n<li>startDate: start date range, let's say I want my report to include data starting Jan 1 this year; Single valued parameter, not blank not null, visible, datetime</li>\n<li>endDate:  end of the date range, let's say it's today/now; Single valued parameter, not blank not null, visible, datetime</li>\n<li><strong>viewOption</strong>:  three hard-coded values (label, value) (\"Current Employees\",1) and (\"Past Employees\",2) and (\"Employees that moved facilities\",3); Multi-valued Parameter (so select all is an option), not blank, not null, visible, text</li>\n<li>personID: based on the dataset getListOfNames where the label is the employee name and the value is their personID (guid/uniqueidentifier); Single select, not null, not blank, text and visible<br></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>My Data Sets \n<ul>\n<li>getListOfNames:  this gets a list of people that were at the company in the provided date range at the given facility and where their employee status is in the viewOption parameter value (so it can be just one number or up to three).  This is a stored procedure but I have set up it to handle the multi-valued parameter by passing it join(parameter, \"~\") and then separating it out in the stored proc.  This works on 5 other reports.  </li>\n<li>getReportInfoOnSelectedPerson: main body query; after the user selects the employee they want data on, this takes that personID and the date range and fills the main table. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem:<br>\nSSRS says viewOption doesn't exist.  But I see it, right there, in the Parameters folder on the left hand side.  I see it when I go to enter an expression under Parameters.  There is no squiggly red line under Parameters!viewOption.value.  But, when I try and put it as a value for a parameter used by the getListOfNames dataset, it errors.  If I put it in the getReportInfoOnSelectedPerson dataset and use it in the exact same way, SSRS is okay with that.  Wtf?  So... I have checked the rdl and everything is fine (where the actual parameter is declared, where it is used in the dataset reference, everything).  It's just this one dataset.  And I have a similar report that uses the same data set, same basic parameters and that report is fine.  I try setting the value of the dataset parameter to 1 or something and that is fine but when I try and set it to Parameter!viewOption.value it errors..... Now, above I said i normally pass the stored proc a Join on the paramater with a tilde ~ but I am trying to keep it simple and either get it to just work in general (either by passing it the first value of the multivalue viewOption parameter or turning that parameter into a single select and just passing the .value) but the join doesnt work either.  All of those things work for the other dataset, which is also a stored proc.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>This is my error:<br>\nAn error has occurred during report processing. (rsProcessingAborted)  The Value expression for the query parameter ‘@viewOption’ contains an error: The expression referenced a non-existing parameter in the report parameters collection. (rsRuntimeErrorInExpression)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Which is clearly saying my parameter doesn't exist but I can SEE it... everywhere.  And  if I assign one of the other datasets' parameter values to the viewOption parameter it works without an error.  I've checked the rdl.</p>\n\n<p>I've had this problem before and it was fixed by deleting both the parameter and dataset and creating them again (for safety I renamed both of them).  That didn't work this time.</p>\n\n<p>I am so frustrated.

The secondary databases follow a \"plugin\" approach. I use SQL Server.</p>\n\n<p>A simple installation of the application will just have the mainDB, while as an option one can activate more \"plug-ins\" and for every plug-in there will be a new database.</p>\n\n<p>Now why I made this choice is because I have to work with an exisiting legacy system and this is the smartest thing I could figure to implement the plugin system.</p>\n\n<p>MainDB and Plugins DB have exactly the same schema (basically Plugins DB have some \"special content\", some important data that one can use as a kind of template - think to a letter template for example - in the application). Plugin DBs are so used in readonly mode, they are \"repository of content\". The \"smart\" thing is that the main application can also be used by \"plugin writers\", they just write a DB inserting content, and by making a backup of the database they creaetd a potential plugin (this is why all DBs has the same schema).</p>\n\n<p>Those plugins DB are downloaded from internet as there is a content upgrade available, every time the full PlugIn DB is destroyed and a new one with the same name is creaetd. This is for simplicity and even because the size of this DBs is generally small.</p>\n\n<p>Now this works, anyway I would prefer to organize the DBs in a kind of Tree structure, so that I can force the PlugIn DBs to be \"sub-DBs\" of the main application DB.</p>\n\n<p>As a workaround I am thinking of using naming rules, like:</p>\n\n<p>ApplicationDB (for the main application DB)</p>\n\n<p>ApplicationDB_PlugIn_N (for the N-th plugin DB)</p>\n\n<p>When I search for plugin 1 I try to connect to ApplicationDB_PlugIn_1, if I don't find the DB i raise an error. This situation can happen for example if som DBA renamed ApplicationDB_Plugin_1.</p>\n\n<p>So since those Plugin DBs are really dependant on ApplicationDB only I was trying to \"do the subfolder trick\".</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone suggest a way to do this?

So I know the name of the plugins, so if I want to query all the GUNS from all plugins i will do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_1.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\nunion\nselect * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_2.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\nunion\nselect * from ApplicationDB_Plugin_3.dbo.weapons where weapon_type = 'gun'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so the \"trick\" is using the dbname to distinguish between plugins.

It just stops working randomly.  Then, if we restart the SQL Server, it will start working again.  I have thought of my server was really running out of memory but now, I just see the problem again.  SQL Server is using 300MB RAM only and my server has 16GB RAM.  This sounds impossible that it's because I am running out of memory.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I want to collect more information on this problem.  Any log that I can turn on and look at?

Now, I hope if I run the stored proc again in the original database, it should get the assembly loaded as it were.  Guess what.  No, it doesn't.  It still gives me the same error.  It looks like this database is completely stuck.  The only way to fix it is to reboot the SQL Server.  I am hoping there is a flag/lock somewhere in the system table holding up this.

For some reason it wraps double quotes ONLY around the data source and nothing else. However this may just be the debugger removing the outside quotes since it's stored in a <code>string</code> datatype. I also verified that SQL server is accessible without specifying the port and it is. Finally, I verified that the server is allowed to accept remote connections. Considering this instance of SQL Server is installed locally, using the default port, and on my development computer I couldn't imagine why I would be getting an error like this.</p>\n\n<p>Is this because the SqlConnectionStringBuilder is overriding my port with it's own port? Do I need to for some reason open up ports on my firewall? Knowing it's a fully local installation it shouldn't be encountering firewall problems.

But it also does not know what data was already sent to the central. Therefore it has to ask the central what is its the last available data.</p></li>\n<li><p>If I understand the <code>END CONVERSATION</code> correctly, the command causes sending only a kind of empty message <code>N'http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/EndDialog'</code>. Because of this, the central should probably send my type <code>ReplyMessage</code> with the answer back before the <code>END CONVERSATION</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Meanwhile, the satellite should probably do nothing to behave asychronously (i.e. waits after sending the <code>RequestMessage</code>). Once the <code>ReplyMessage</code> arrives, it activates a satellite procedure that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>receives the message and get the wanted information,</li>\n<li>receives the EndDialog message and ends the previous dialog at the satellite side, </li>\n<li>prepares the data to be sent to the central (the XML string form),</li>\n<li>opens the new dialog,</li>\n<li>sends the prepared data,</li>\n<li>and makes itself dormant until another <code>ReplyMessage</code> arrives.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The central should behave similarly. Once the <code>RequestMessage</code> arrives, it activates the central procedure that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>receives the request message, </li>\n<li>extracts the XML information and updates the central database,</li>\n<li>gets the info about the last available data for the satellite,</li>\n<li>forms and sends the <code>ReplyMessage</code>,</li>\n<li>ends the dialog at the central side.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So far, is my view correct?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now some details that I am not sure about:</strong> As I want to make it robust, working without a human touch, it should start on its own when the mechanism is installed. The communication should always be started by the satellite (the central may not know even if the satellite works or even exists).</p>\n\n<p>The satellite already uses a trigger fired by a raw data that is processed to build the records that are collected at the central. This way, the trigger could initiate somehow the first SSB request of the satellite to the central. But...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How the trigger can check that there is no pending communication between the satellite and the central? As the satellite is always the initiator, the question can also be formulated as... How the trigger can check whether the satellite waits for some <code>ReplyMessage</code>? Or, how to know that there is some open dialog between the satellite and the central?\n<ul>\n<li>If there is no conversation, the trigger forms the data record (stored in a local table), and then it could start the communication proces (see the point 1 above).</li>\n<li>If there is any conversation, the trigger only forms the record that is to be sent later, and nothing else is done. Data will be sent when the <code>ReplyMessage</code> is obtained by the activated procedure (see the point 3 above).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>On <em>making the satellite dormant</em> (see the last bullet of the point 3 above) I mean that there should probably be no other message in the message queue (nothing to be processed in the loop) and the activated procedure is to be naturally finished. But I am not sure if I think correctly here. Can you comment on that?</li>\n<li>If nothing is broken, and if the data is produced fast enough, the satellite and the central have always something to exchange. This way, the trigger should never try to start the communication.</li>\n<li>When there is nothing else to be sent to the central by the activated satellite procedure (actually, it is not active), or when the system is restarted somehow (no dialog exists yet), the trigger starts the communication process. But how could I do it? Should the trigger simply send the <code>RequestMessage</code> to the central? (This way the <code>ReplyMessage</code> would activate the satellite procedure and the procedure would continue until there is anything to process.)</li>\n<li>Say, the <code>RequestMessage</code> means <em>here is some data, process them, and reply what is the last</em> (or what next should be send or what next action is recommended from the central -- depends on the bussiness logic, probably not important here). Is it OK to send <em>empty XML</em> in the <code>RequestMessage</code> in the sense <em>I do not know what else you need -- tell me</em>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>First update</strong> -- based on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13198768/1346705\">the Remus Rusanu's answer below</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I have to agree that this would be <em>chatty</em> protocol. Moreover, the records are created as temperature samples from the real environment and the frequency of sampling is rather low. This means that the complicated protocol could be usefull only in the special case of restarting everything or so.</p>\n\n<p>But when the conversation should be left open <em>forever</em>, the unique identifier for the dialog handle or should be stored persistently in some configuration table, or it could even be hardwired to the code. The trigger will send the records on the fly immediately, and the central will simply not send the <code>ReplyMessage</code>. Is it correct? Can that kind of coversation be effectively considered a monolog?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second update</strong> to make this question reasonably short.</p>\n\n<p>See the continuation <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/13203389/1346705\">Service Broker: How should a trigger start infinitely opened dialog?</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","service-broker"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13203389,"title":"Service Broker: How should a trigger start infinitely opened dialog?","body":"<p>The question is a continuation of the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/13197781/1346705\">Service Broker: Designing the communication between two SQL servers</a> (to make the earlier reasonably short).</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the above question suggested the usage of a simpler scenario of sending the regularly generated data via <em>forever</em> opened dialog. A trigger, that is responsible for forming the data at the satellite SQL server and sending it do the central SQL server, will probably use the fixed unique identifier.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the conversation must be started at first. Say, the conversation handle is fixed. How can I detect the situation when the conversation was not open yet?</p>\n\n<p>If it is possible to detect the conversation was not started yet, I could combine the two approaches. The special request with empty-string message value could be send to the central, and the central would send back a reply only for that special request. The satellite activated procedure would then send the missing data to the central at once. </p>\n\n<p>Simply said, I have to solve the initial situation when quite a lot of data could be collected at the satellite machine. The satellite activated procedure could sent the data in chunks to give both sides a chance to do also something else than moving the data. Once the reply message from the central arrives in situation when there is nothing else to send, the activated procedure could set some persistent flag for the trigger to start sending the single records in a monolog way.

Then I followed the instructions on <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN to install the Session State Database using the aspnet_regsql tool</a>.</li>\n<li>In both of my Web Application's Web.config file, I've added the following under <code>&lt;System.Web&gt;</code>: </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"server=.\\sqlexpress;database=dbSessionTest;uid=myUsername;pwd=myPassword\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"20\" allowCustomSqlDatabase=\"true\"/&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Both sites function normally, but they don't seem to be <em>sharing</em> the session. For example, when I click my button to save my session variable from Site1, I'd expect to be able to read that value from Site2, but it doesn't work. Site2 will only return \"Site2\" and Site1 will only return \"Site1\". </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas on what I could be doing wrong? Am I wrong in thinking that I should be able to read a value set by Site1 from Site2?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can see that session data is getting stored in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table in SQL Management Studio, but each site can still only see the value which it wrote. Both sites are setting the session variable like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Session(\"LastSiteUsed\") = \"Site2\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And both sites are retrieving the value like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lblValue.Text = \"Value from Session: \" &amp; Session(\"LastSiteUsed\").ToString\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do I need to do this differently for accessing session variables stored in SQL Server?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've tried using the default database, ASPState, which is created by running this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aspnet_regsql.exe -S MyServerName -E -ssadd -sstype p\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then simplified each of my Web.config files like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"20\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But again, no luck. I want to be able to set a session variable from Site1 and then read the value from Site2, but it's not working. Again, I'm able to see entries showing up in the <code>ASPStateTempSessions</code> table so I know they're getting entered correctly. One thing I noticed is they have different session IDs? </p>\n\n<p>Is there something I need to be doing differently to ensure the same session ID is used between my sites when setting/reading the same session variable?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've followed the instructions from <strong><a href=\"http://www.stionasoftware.com/Blogs/post/2010/10/27/Sharing-NET-Session-across-multiple-applications.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a></strong> which modifies an SP and adds a column for grouping to the <code>ASPStateTempApplications</code> table. This <em>kind of</em> worked, but only if both of my sites were open in the same browser (using tabs). I need to be able to open Site1 in IE, save a value to my session variable, close the browser, open Site2 in Chrome, and read the value. From everything I've read with SQL Server Session State... this should be possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4 - SOLUTION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I followed the answer on <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2868316/sharing-sessions-across-applications-using-the-asp-net-session-state-service/3151315#3151315\">this article</a></strong> provided by @SilverNinja. I re-created the <code>ASPState</code> database via the command prompt (to undo my SP changes in Update #3) and then modified the <code>TempGetAppID</code> SP as per the answer from the link. I've also updated both of my Web.config files to match the answer from that article as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\"\n              sqlConnectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword;Application Name=CacheTest\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also included identical Machine Keys in both Web.config files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;machineKey validationKey=\"59C42C5AB0988049AB0555E3F2128061AE9B75E3A522F25B34A21A46B51F188A5C0C1C74F918DFB44C33406B6E874A54167DFA06AC3BE1C3FEE8506E710015DB\" decryptionKey=\"3C98C7E33D6BC8A8C4B7D966F42F2818D33AAB84A81C594AF8F4A533ADB23B97\" validation=\"SHA1\" decryption=\"AES\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I am able to (using IE) open up both of my sites, set a value from Site1, and read it from Site2 (and vice versa). When I check the table, only one SessionID exists (both sites are using the same session correctly). I was wrong in my thinking before that opening a new browser (for example, with Chrome), would use the same session - a new browser will start it's own session. On a load-balanced scenario though, this shouldn't cause any issues.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","vb.net","insert","sql-update"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":1,"question_id":13178360,"title":"SQL Server command in vb.net not working cause all in one sentence","body":"<p>This is propably a very easy question.</p>\n\n<p>But i cant fix it.\nI try an update if @ID = column id, else insert all.</p>\n\n<p>Only this one doesn't work if i put it all in one sentence</p>\n\n<pre><code>Cmd.CommandText = \"UPDATE Locatie SET (Longitude = @Longitude, Latitude = @Latitude, Timestamp = @Timestamp) WHERE ID=@ID IF @@ROWCOUNT=0 INSERT INTO Locatie VALUES (@ID, @Longitude, @Latitude, @Timestamp)\"\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","stored-procedures","insert","record","insert-update"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":13178962,"title":"How to insert some record in Sql?","body":"<p>i'm want insert some record in sql server. i try query but insert all record and value duplicate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>i need don't duplicate value and insert some record.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Table filesTA</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>runNo   cDate           cIn         cOut    \n00001   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:21:00.000 2012-10-09 20:34:00.000 \n00005   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:36:00.000 2012-10-09 17:04:00.000 \n00006   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:55:00.000 2012-10-09 20:34:00.000 \n00007   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:50:00.000 2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 \n00008   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:56:00.000 2012-10-09 20:35:00.000 \n00009   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:57:00.000 2012-10-09 20:32:00.000 \n00010   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:58:00.000 2012-10-09 19:03:00.000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>this code Stored Procedure</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT \n     em.empNo,\n     ISNULL(tf.cDate, '2012-10-09'),\n     tf.cIn,tf.cOut\nFROM \n     filesTA tf Full Outer join \n     Emp em On tf.runNo = em.empNo AND tf.cDate = '2012-10-09'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>result from code Stored Procedure (On Datagridview display)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>empNo   cDate           cIn         cOut\n00001   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:21:00.000 2012-10-09 20:34:00.000\n00002   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 NULL                    NULL\n00003   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 NULL                    NULL\n00004   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 NULL                    NULL\n00005   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:36:00.000 2012-10-09 17:04:00.000\n00006   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:55:00.000 2012-10-09 20:34:00.000\n00007   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:50:00.000 2012-10-09 00:00:00.000\n00008   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:56:00.000 2012-10-09 20:35:00.000\n00009   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:57:00.000 2012-10-09 20:32:00.000\n00010   2012-10-09 00:00:00.000 2012-10-09 07:58:00.000 2012-10-09 19:03:00.000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>result from code Stored Procedure. it's not insert to sql.

If I had the whole table in memory, is there a way to run counts against it without going back and forth to SQL Server? I'm hoping to cut out the overhead of the: network, I/O, locking, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The most complex where clause would be something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a=1 or b in (2,3) or c&lt;4 or d like '%5' or substring(e,2,1)='z'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it's not trivial and supporting as much as possible of T-SQL would be ideal, but I don't think DataTable's .Select() method supports this OR is it very fast. So given a table of data in memory, can I could rows using T-SQL syntax very fast (or in parallel)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","osx","microsoft","navicat"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13170242,"title":"Microsoft SQL Server Client for Mac OS X","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3452/sql-client-for-mac-os-x-that-works-with-ms-sql-server\">SQL Client for Mac OS X that works with MS SQL Server</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I am looking for a SQL Server client that has comfortable GUI and works with Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried Navicat, but it crashes all too frequently and has a great problem connecting to SQL Server when the latter is under load.Note: we are using SQL Server 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Any Recommendations?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","networking","jdbc","tcp","wireshark"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":0,"question_id":13169982,"title":"How to capture & analyze network traffic for jdbc mssql \"connection recv failed\" error","body":"<p>One of our customers has intermittent database connection problems.

Now we are getting Windows 2008 servers with SQL Server 2008 R2. </p>\n\n<p>There is a web application based on classic ASP (full of wtf's) that is using SQl Server as a storage. \nIn the new set-up ASP web-site is on Web-server, SQL Server 2008 is on another machine. All the servers are in the domain. \nI had a big trouble connecting that web-site to SQL Server. Got it done by using a domain user  as user to run the application pool. \nSo whenever I use that web-site within domain, I get everything working fine.</p>\n\n<p>The problem starts whenever I go to outside of the domain (from my home computer). The web-application is rejected the connection to the SQL Server. Application pool is not configured to use pass-through authentication, AppPool is using the same user as the web-site. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/seEKN.png\" alt=\"Application Pool configuration\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PE8aB.png\" alt=\"Process Monitor shows denied access to the named pipes when connecting from the outside of the domain\"></p>\n\n<p>I have used ProcMon (from sysinternals) to figure out what happens. And it shows that connection to the SQL Server (via named pipe) is just denied when request to the web-site comes from outside of the domain. </p>\n\n<p>I have used fiddler to compare the HTTP requests and both requests are the same, no domain authorisation or any information is passed to IIS from within of the domain. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The questions are: WHY this happens and how to make it stop??</strong></p>\n\n<p>Any ideas are appreciated. I'm stuck as never been before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Figured it out today. Firewall was forcing to use Named Pipes connection instead of TCP. And Named Pipes are just not the same as usual TCP connection. </p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008","tsql","pivot","pivot-without-aggregate"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":63,"score":-1,"question_id":13142554,"title":"X number of Rows into X number of Columns","body":"<p>I need your help again for the following.

For years, it has worked fine when the SQL Server was on Win2008 Standard 64-bit SP2 and SQL Server 2008 v10.0.4.  I recently moved the back-end SQL db to a newer server (Win2008 R2 Standard 64-bit and SQL v10.50.1600).  After the move, everything on the application worked just fine as expected, no issues.  However, we have a month-end process that generates relatively large reports (300-500 pages) which uncovered an issue that we don't normally see in our day-to-day processing.</p>\n\n<p>My report is based on a pass-through query.  The query runs almost instantaneously and produces 8000 rows.  I can preview the query and quickly navigate to the end of the RS to see the 8000'th row.  No problem.  If I pull up the report that's based on that query, I can see that there are 350 pages and I can navigate page-by-page through the report with no problem.  I can even type in a page number and jump to page 50, 100, 150, etc. with no problem. Note, there is no processing/code/logic happening on any fired events on the report - just displaying and formatting the data.  </p>\n\n<p>HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM OCCURS:  If I preview the report and try to jump to the last page from the first page, it'll sit and think for a while (38 seconds to be exact) and then throw <strong>Error #3151 ODBC Connection to [DNS Name] Failed.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>If I simply update the connect string on the pass-through query to point it back to the \"older\" SQL Server and run the same thing, it works just fine.

Once the result set are returned, PHP loop through the result set, row by row and display the rows as it flow through. </p>\n\n<p>What happens is that from time to time, the result page can take a extremely long to load,where no results set are displayed but the web browser loading bar/icon flashes. Some times it will just give a blank screen at the end of the load, which typically means the query connection has timed-out or some times it will return the result set. For example, under normal behaviour, a page will take approx 1-3s to load, while at odd times, it may take up to 20-30s.</p>\n\n<p>I have noticed that if I run queries in SQLSVR Mgmt Studio, queries that may take ~5s to return a result set may take approx ~15s to load on my web server. </p>\n\n<p>I know poor PHP coding can cause slow downs but the odd performance behaviour has me bit baffled, as Im sure my coding isnt that bad.</p>\n\n<p>So if people could offer some tips in how I can go about diagnosting or isolating the problem, or advise areas that I could look at, it will be great.

For some reasons, MS SQL doesn't allow me to use cascading update on the foreign key, so the database cannot be migrated so easily. </p>\n\n<p>What makes things worse is that the software has a lot of editing screens, that use DataSets, DataGridViews and binding in Windows Forms, so the editor works pretty much automagically. For example, editor for <code>PRODUCTS</code> is a simple windows form, and whenever user renames a product (changes its <code>NAME</code>), the changes are propagated through database (via cascading update) to <code>PRICE_LISTING</code> and <code>PRODUCT_ALTERNATIVES</code> tables. And also, if the app wants to show price listings, it does simple <code>SELECT * FROM PRICE_LISTING</code> that includes product names and price.</p>\n\n<p>One approach might be to add surrogate keys - <code>ID</code> identity columns to each table, then modify for example <code>PRICE_LISTING</code> table to (<code>PRODUCT_ID, price</code>) etc. But then, to show price, I'd have to define view that will </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT *,PRODUCT.NAME,PRODUCT.CATEGORY,PRODUCT.SHORTNAME FROM PRICE_LISTING join PRODUCT on ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then, the automatically generated DataSets etc. will have to be modified to select from view, update the view.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell and from the original author's perspective, we are breaking the program and making it more complicated. The only single thing that does not work when ported in a straightforward manner is the cascading update, but I see that the database design is very flawed and it will be a maintenance nightmare if not fixed.</p>\n\n<p>What to do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","sql-server","database","tsql"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":13117710,"title":"How to export all words from sql table or sql database","body":"<p>Let's say we have following table.</p>\n\n<pre>\nUserId | Message\n-------|-------------\n1      | Hi, have a nice day\n2      | Hi, I had a nice day\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>I need to have all { Hi,-have-a-nice-day-I-had } words separately.\nIs there any way to do that ?

Been banging my head against the wall for quite some time on this.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise is it a case of just using loops and bearing with the execution time?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","sql-server"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13104356,"title":"Display varbinary as a downloadable link","body":"<p>Fairly straightforward question, I have images stored in my database as varbinary and would like to provide a link to these images rather than displaying them on the website.

Here's an example of what I've got so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyUserSeeder : IEntitySeeder {\n    public void InitializeEntities(AssessmentSystemContext context, SqlConnection connection) {\n        context.MyUsers.Add(new MyUser { MyUserId = 106, ConceptPersonId = 520476, Salutation = \"Mrs\", Firstname = \"Novelette\", Surname = \"Aldred\", Email = null, LoginId = \"520476\", Password=\"28c923d21b68fdf129b46de949b9f7e0d03f6ced8e9404066f4f3a75e115147489c9f68195c2128e320ca9018cd711df\", IsEnabled = true, SpecialRequirements = null });\n        try {\n            connection.Open();\n            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(\"SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[MyUser] ON\", connection);\n            int retVal = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\n            context.SaveChanges();\n        }\n        finally {\n            connection.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So close and yet so far - because, although <code>cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()</code> works fine, when I then run <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, I'm informed that \"Explicit value must be specified for identity column in table 'MyUser' either when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to ON or when a replication user is inserting into a NOT FOR REPLICATION identity column.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, because MyUserId (which is the Identity column in the MyUser table) is the primary key, entity framework doesn't try to set it when I call <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, even though I gave the <code>MyUser</code> entity a value for the <code>MyUserId</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to force entity framework to try and insert even primary key values for an entity, then?  Or maybe a way to temporarily mark <code>MyUserId</code> as not being a primary key value, so EF tries to insert it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008-r2"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":1,"question_id":13101414,"title":"Identity column and using order by in query","body":"<p>I use SQL Server 2008 R2 and have a table with an <code>id</code> column as <code>identity(1,1)</code>.
