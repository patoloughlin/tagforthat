Basically, we have a list of English notations that represent operations in C. They're stored as a list when they're passed to our Prolog program. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add 4 to 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is </p>\n\n<pre><code>[add, 4, to, 3]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We need to write a function that takes that list an returns the equivalent. So if I called</p>\n\n<pre><code>english2C([add,4,to,3], C).\nC = 4+3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It would bind C to the result. So the data structure itself would be something like +(4(3)). We have a list of such English notation we have to translate, so it's a finite number. It's not like we have to account for all possibilities. There are also combinations, where they take two operations and combine them (with a comma in between)</p>\n\n<pre><code>english2C([add,3,to,5,',',then,subtract,7], C).\nC = 3+5-7\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm just somewhat confused as to how to start. I know I can take the very first element of the list and that will always be an operator (+,-,*, etc etc) and then I can just recursively go through the list looking for the operands. The problem there is for things that require order of operations, like \"add 3 to 5 then multiply by 4\", which should be represented as (3+5)*4 but if you just translate it directly you get 3+5*4.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and we have to see if we can get it to run backwards (give it a C statement (3+5) and translate back to english (add 3 to 5)). That part I don't really have an idea for at all.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: There's a large enough permutations of possible English notations that I can't just pattern match everything. I get the idea that what I need to do is match the first operator with it's corresponding arithmetic symbol then find the operands. For a combinational statement, that would be the first part (so I would have 3+5) and then there would be a comma followed by the next statement. By the way, the combinational statements can be as long as they want, so it's not just two statements and I'm done. </p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","list","index"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11,"score":0,"question_id":13279914,"title":"how do I make a list of my postings on Wordpress 3.4.2. and theme Twenty Ten","body":"<p>I've tried to find a solution to allow me to make an \"Index\" of postings I have published (349 posts, 27 pages, 28 categories and 50 tags). \nIs there a simple solution allowing me to display, as a page or post, an \"index\" of ALL posts, pages, etc. with WordPress?\nAn \"Index Page\" where readers and/or subscribers can click on a post/page and be taken to that particular posting.\nI've tried various plugins - (Index Press), (Table of Contents Plus) to mention just a couple but, unless I'm doing something wrong, nothing seems to work for me.   </p>\n"},{"tags":["python","string","list","combinations","vowel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":2,"question_id":13280357,"title":"Finding all combinations of vowel replacements","body":"<p>I am trying to find all possible combinations for all vowels in a word.

I checked the FAQ and I think this qualifies, since it is specific and related to programming.</p>\n\n<p>I'm implementing a complex data mining algorithm (FP-growth) in Java.  Some of the initial phases of the algorithm require me to scan a large database and keep a running count of each item type found.  This seems perfectly suited to a <code>Hashbag</code> interface.  I found one in Apache Commons which seems to work for me.</p>\n\n<p>So now, my HashBag is filled with [itemType, count] entries (pairs).  Later on in the algorithm, I'm required to do a lot of list-like operations on these pairs.  In some cases, I must sort the collection by itemType.  In others, I must sort by count.  This seems perfectly suited to a <code>List</code> interface.</p>\n\n<p>I'm left with the conclusion that I must convert my Hasbag to a List.  Yet it feels dirty somehow, like a waste of space and time.  Is there a smarter way to do this, or is it a common situation to have a programming problem where you must treat your collection differently at different times, and conversions are a necessary evil?</p>\n\n<p>One alternative is to make my own interface which is truly a list, but allows \"bag-style\" adds.  I'd have to keep the list sorted and perform binary searches with a custom comparator every time I wanted to add something.  Building that collection would probably take longer than building a Hashbag, but I'd save on the conversion step at the end.

As a result, you can retrieve the separate section of the output using \"$\" or indexation with square brackets. My question is how I can create an output in list form, without overtly showing that it is a list. As you know, when a list is printed on the screen, it typically has the sub-list name or index indicated, such as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>L1 = list(a=1:3, b=letters[1:3])\nL1\n\n$a\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$b\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, lm() output never shows the different sub-lists using \"$\" and sub-list names - although you can extract these sub-lists using \"$\" and sub-list names.</p>\n\n<p>A second question pertains to the fact that some functions' outputs include much more than what is actually printed on the screen (e.g., lm(), again).

Here is my code with explanations:`</p>\n\n<pre><code>   public static void deleteItemsFromProduct(long nomer) { \\\\ long nomer - id of deleted position in List A \n\n        // getting cursor\n        cursor_child = DataSourceChild.queryAllinChild();\n\n        if (cursor_child != null) {\n\n            // defining string array for all items that have id marks matched to nomer \n            par = new String[]{String.valueOf(nomer)};\n\n            // deleting string array \n            db_child.delete(DBHelperChild.TABLE_ITEMS_AND_PRICES, DBHelperChild.COLUMN_NOMER + \"=?\", par);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>// untill this point everything works and clear for understanding </p>\n\n<pre><code>// put current nomer into setter \nProd.setProdId(nomer);\n\n// define it for each item in the the next set of items\ncv_child = new ContentValues();\ncv_child.put(DBHelperChild.COLUMN_NOMER, Prod.getProdId());\n\n\n// defining next string array \npar = new String[]{String.valueOf(nomer+1)};\n\n// update items with next id mark \nint updCount = db_child.update(DBHelperChild.TABLE_ITEMS_AND_PRICES, cv_child, DBHelperChild.COLUMN_NOMER + \"=?\", par);\n\nLog.d(LOG_TAG, \"updated rows count = \" + updCount);\n\n            if (cursor_child.moveToFirst()) {\n\n                Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"--- Left in the table for items and prices: ---\");\n\n                do {\n\n                    Log.d(LOG_TAG,\n                            \"item id = \" + cursor_child.getInt(item_and_price_idColIndex)\n                            + \", item name = \" + cursor_child.getString(item_ColIndex)\n                            + \", item price = \" + cursor_child.getInt(price_ColIndex)\n                            + \", product nomer = \" + cursor_child.getInt(nomer_ColIndex));\n\n                } while (cursor_child.moveToNext());\n            } else {\n            }\n\n        } else {\n            Log.d(LOG_TAG, \"Cursor is null\");\n            // close cursor\n            cursor_child.close();\n\n        }\n    }`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the Log of what I am doing because it is hard to describe in words especially for the new guy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>`10:16:11.109   113 com.android.inputmethod.latin   DEBUG   dalvikvm    GC_EXTERNAL_ALLOC freed 74K, 49% free 2904K/5639K, external 2317K/2503K, paused 91ms\n10:16:14.880    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       Item and Price rows inserted, id = 434\n10:16:14.900    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 431, item name = 0, item price = 0, product nomer = 0\n10:16:14.900    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 432, item name = 1, item price = 1, product nomer = 1\n10:16:14.909    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 433, item name = 2, item price = 2, product nomer = 2\n10:16:14.920    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 434, item name = 3, item price = 3, product nomer = 3\n10:16:16.470    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       ChildActivity: onPause()\n10:16:16.529    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       MainActivity: onResume()\n10:16:16.600    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       Product id = 165, name = х, image = /mnt/sdcard/download/sliced-bread-icon.png\n10:16:16.619    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       Product id = 166, name = м, image = /mnt/sdcard/download/meat-icon.png\n10:16:16.640    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       Product id = 167, name = н, image = /mnt/sdcard/download/Basket-icon.png\n10:16:16.659    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       Product id = 168, name = х, image = /mnt/sdcard/download/sliced-bread-icon.png\n10:16:17.229    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       ChildActivity: onDestroy()\n10:16:24.230    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       --- Delete from table for products: ---\n10:16:24.230    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       deleted row id = 166, name = м, image = /mnt/sdcard/download/meat-icon.png\n10:16:24.491    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       updated rows count = 1\n10:16:24.504    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       --- Left in the table for items and prices: ---\n10:16:24.520    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 431, item name = 0, item price = 0, product nomer = 0\n10:16:24.520    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 433, item name = 2, item price = 2, product nomer = 1\n10:16:24.530    2493    example.CustomAdapter   DEBUG       item id = 434, item name = 3, item price = 3, product nomer = 3\n10:16:24.700    61  system_process  WARN    InputManagerService Window already focused, ignoring focus gain of: com.android.internal.view.IInputMethodClient$Stub$Proxy@407873b0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>`\nFrom the LOG could be seen that when I delete Product id = 166 that stands in the List with id 1 (product nomer 1), item id = 432 with product nomer 1 is also deleted. Next item id = 433 gets deleted nomer 1 and replaces it but item id = 434 still stays as nomer 3 but not 2. How to change my code in a proper way to solve this problem. This is the final thing to do in my firts application.

This may\n  be due to a corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in\n  linkListTesting.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded.

An example implementation follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>W3iCurrencyListener callback = new W3iCurrencyListener() {\n              @Override\n              onRedeem(List&lt;Balance&gt; balances) {\n\n                     //Take possession of the balances returned here.             \n\n              }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The collection of Balance objects may be for different currency types, if your application supports multiple currencies. \nIf the call to redeemCurrency() succeeds, you will receive a collection of balances.  If not, the onRedeem() callback will not fire.  This method will not return currencies unless a user has converted an offer by downloading and installing an application, or completing another action for non-app offers.</p>\n\n<p>But i don't know how to implement this to my app, i have setted up the offerwall, it show and the user can complete offers, but i need to read the postback, giving the value of offer in point to user, can someone help me?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","string","list","dictionary","int"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2847,"score":6,"question_id":5316720,"title":"Python: How to convert a list of dictionaries' values into int/float from string?","body":"<p>I have a list of dictionaries as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list = [ { 'a':'1' , 'b':'2' , 'c':'3' }, { 'd':'4' , 'e':'5' , 'f':'6' } ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I convert the values of each dictionary inside the list to int/float?</p>\n\n<p>So it becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list = [ { 'a':1 , 'b':2 , 'c':3 }, { 'd':4 , 'e':5 , 'f':6 } ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","string","list","integer","find"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":12556825,"title":"Append two integers to list when seperated by '..'

They have been very helpful.\nI've actually run into this situation more than once, and I'd like to give a second example that is unrelated to inheritance.  This is actually a real-world example, and though I've decided my current project is small scale enough to be safe with using vectors based on your answers,  it's a concept that I imagine I'll use on a much larger scale at some point.</p>\n\n<p>In creating an engine for my current Android game project, I found it necessary to create an Imagepoint object that is basically a set of XY coordinates that are used to track significant parts of a sprite image.  Say you have a bone character made up of several bitmaps, it's useful to know where the neck attaches to the torso, the forearm to the bicep, etc.  This xy offset data is used later to calculate the position for various purposes, such as where to position other sprites by using trigonometric functions to find the xy offset given the current angle.</p>\n\n<p>Most sprite objects will need only one image point.  The bicep needs one for the forearm, the forearm needs one for the hand, the neck needs one for the head, etc.  The torsos in my current character models are the exception, and they need several for the shoulders, the legs, the neck, and any removable decorative sprites. </p>\n\n<p>The sprite is the object that contains the imagepoint vectors, there will be no inherited classes, because each : torso, leg, etc is simply an instance of the sprite class, which is strictly a graphical object, containing a pointer to the bitmap, these imagepoints, and assorted position/orientation data, and will not be used for any specialized purposes. If I were to use this concept on a large scale game with massive numbers of instances, where most would require only a single imagepoint, with a few objects requiring several or none, and where there would be no special cases meriting the use of inheritance.

How can I do this in Flex 3.5 and Actionscript and have a button that when clicked, display a list of the checked items??</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","dictionary"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":1,"question_id":13046313,"title":"python assigning a list to a dictionary returns empty list","body":"<p>I have an issue whereby my list frameChain is being reflected as empty (<code>[]</code>). <code>frameChain</code> is actually a list such as: <code>['C Level', 'Medium Term']</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>jsonOut[x]= {'TEXT' : node.attrib['TEXT'],\n             'ID': node.attrib['ID'],\n             'Sessions' : frameChain,}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tried this outside of the function I defined and it seemed to work just fine.

Rather than storing the count and total in the struct, and then computing the average upon output, I'd like to store the count and average in the struct, thus discarding my quantity value after the average has been recalculated.  My struct looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct mystruct \n{\n    string item;\n    long avg;\n    short count;\n} data;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These structs are stored in a list, with an iterator, <code>it</code>, that allows me to move through the list.

Start at an arbitrary node (the first node will do) and \nadd all of its links onto a list.  \n\n2. Add the smallest link (which doesn't duplicate an existing path) \nin the MST, to the    Minimum Spanning Tree.  \nRemove this link from the list.  \n\n3.

The problem is I don't really understand the implementation.

Every game tick, the System calls a specified method over all of its Components. Components are e.g. Physics, Terrain, Draw, Characters, Sound, ...

I can do this by using the built in-predict append(List, NumberOfSteps, List2) and then passing List2 down through the recursion and printing it at the end, but List and List2 aren't unified there and the actual answer that Prolog gives me is List = [] ; true</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling I might be approaching the problem the wrong way but I'm stuck!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":0,"question_id":12893091,"title":"flatten list in python","body":"<p>I want to flatten the list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>exampleArray = [[[151.68694121866872]], \n                [[101.59534468349297]], \n                [[72.16055999176308]]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[151.68694121866872, 101.59534468349297, 72.16055999176308]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right now I am doing this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>resultArray= list(chain.from_iterable(list(chain.from_iterable(exampleArray))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though it works I wanted to know if there's a better way.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","parsing","configparser"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12894094,"title":"How can I get the values of every item in a section?","body":"<p>I have a configuration file with one section, and multiple items with different values.

The values \"Ford\" (for make), \"2012\" (for year), and \"12\" (for the newStock field) are hard-coded into the function \"Main\", and are sent down to the \"updateStockOfCar\" function, which is the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int updateStockOfCar(Record *head, char *make, int year, int newStock)\n{\n        if(head == NULL)\n        {\n            printf(\"The list is empty\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        Record * matching = malloc(sizeof(Record));\n        matching-&gt;make = make;\n        matching-&gt;year = year;\n\n        //If the first record is the one we want to modify, then do so\n        if(strcmp(head-&gt;make, matching-&gt;make) == 0)\n        {\n            if(head-&gt;year == matching-&gt;year)\n            {\n                head-&gt;stock = newStock;\n                return 1;\n            }\n\n            Record* previous = head;\n            Record* current = head-&gt;next;\n\n                //Loop through the list, looking for the record to update\n            while(current != NULL)\n            {\n                if(strcmp(current-&gt;make, matching-&gt;make) == 0 &amp;&amp; current-&gt;year  == matching-&gt;year)\n                {\n                    current-&gt;stock = newStock;\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    previous = current;\n                    current = current -&gt; next;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, this function takes in the head node of the list (where we start our search for the correct node to update), make &amp; year (for the node we're targeting to modify the stock of), and newStock (the value we're going to use to replace the standard \"stock\" field in the targeted node). </p>\n\n<p>Our first case is if head is NULL, in which case, we say that the list is empty and return an unsuccessful \"0\" back to the calling variable in \"Main\".  </p>\n\n<p>Our second case is if the strcmp between the make fields in head in matching are the same, and the year fields in head and matching are the same, then we update head's stock field to newStock and return a successful \"1\" back to funciton \"Main\". In essence, if the head node is the right node to modify, we do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our third case is if the head node is NOT the correct node to modify. On the condition that current (defined as the head to start with) is not NULL, we compare the current node's make and year fields to the targeted node we want to change.

But if you consider a tougher set of words, like Java and work, the output is supposed to be in 6 steps. </p>\n\n<pre><code>['java', 'lava', 'lave', 'wave', 'wove', 'wore', 'work']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my mistake is that I didn't realize you could get to the target word, by using letters that don't exist in the target word or original word. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my Original Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import string\ndef changeling(word,target,steps):\n    alpha=string.ascii_lowercase\n    x=word##word and target has been changed to keep the coding readable.\n    z=target\n    if steps==0 and word!= target:##if the target can't be reached, return nothing.\n        return []\n    if x==z:##if target has been reached.\n        return [z]\n\n\n    if len(word)!=len(target):##if the word and target word aren't the same length print error.\n        print \"error\"\n        return None\n    i=1\n    if lookup\n    if lookup(z[0]+x[1:]) is True and z[0]+x[1:]!=x :##check every letter that could be from z, in variations of, and check if they're in the dictionary.\n        word=z[0]+x[1:]\n    while i!=len(x):\n        if lookup(x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]) and x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]!=x:\n            word=x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]\n\n        i+=1\n    if lookup(x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(word)-1]) and x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(x)-1]!=x :##same applies here.\n        word=x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(word)-1]\n\n\n    y =  changeling(word,target,steps-1)\n    if y :\n      return [x] + y##used to concatenate the first word to the final list, and if the list goes past the amount of steps.\n    else:\n      return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's my current code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import string\ndef changeling(word,target,steps):\n    alpha=string.ascii_lowercase\n    x=word##word and target has been changed to keep the coding readable.\n    z=target\n    if steps==0 and word!= target:##if the target can't be reached, return nothing.\n        return []\n    if x==z:##if target has been reached.\n        return [z]\n    holderlist=[]\n\n\n    if len(word)!=len(target):##if the word and target word aren't the same length print error.\n        print \"error\"\n        return None\n    i=1\n    for items in alpha:\n\n        i=1\n        while i!=len(x):\n            if lookup(x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]) is True and x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]!=x:\n                word =x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]\n                holderlist.append(word)\n\n            i+=1\n        if lookup(x[:len(x)-1]+items) is True and x[:len(x)-1]+items!=x:\n            word=x[:len(x)-1]+items\n            holderlist.append(word)\n\n    y =  changeling(word,target,steps-1)\n    if y :\n      return [x] + y##used to concatenate the first word to the final list, and if the/\n   list goes past the amount of steps.\n    else:\n      return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The differences between the two is that the first checks every variation of find with the letters from lose. Meaning: lind, fond, fisd, and fine. Then, if it finds a working word with the lookup function, it calls changeling on that newfound word.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to my new program, which checks every variation of find with every single letter in the alphabet. </p>\n\n<p>I can't seem to get this code to work. I've tested it by simply printing what the results are of find: </p>\n\n<pre><code>for items in alpha:\n\n        i=1\n        while i!=len(x):\n             print (x[:i-1]+items+x[i:])\n\n             i+=1\n        print (x[:len(x)-1]+items)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This gives:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aind\nfand\nfiad\nfina\nbind\nfbnd\nfibd\nfinb\ncind\nfcnd\nficd\nfinc\ndind\nfdnd\nfidd\nfind\neind\nfend\nfied\nfine\nfind\nffnd\nfifd\nfinf\ngind\nfgnd\nfigd\nfing\nhind\nfhnd\nfihd\nfinh\niind\nfind\nfiid\nfini\njind\nfjnd\nfijd\nfinj\nkind\nfknd\nfikd\nfink\nlind\nflnd\nfild\nfinl\nmind\nfmnd\nfimd\nfinm\nnind\nfnnd\nfind\nfinn\noind\nfond\nfiod\nfino\npind\nfpnd\nfipd\nfinp\nqind\nfqnd\nfiqd\nfinq\nrind\nfrnd\nfird\nfinr\nsind\nfsnd\nfisd\nfins\ntind\nftnd\nfitd\nfint\nuind\nfund\nfiud\nfinu\nvind\nfvnd\nfivd\nfinv\nwind\nfwnd\nfiwd\nfinw\nxind\nfxnd\nfixd\nfinx\nyind\nfynd\nfiyd\nfiny\nzind\nfznd\nfizd\nfinz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is perfect! Notice that each letter in the alphabet goes through my word at least once. Now, what my program does is use a helper function to determine if that word is in a dictionary that I've been given.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this, instead of like my first program, I now receive multiple words that are legal, except when I do word=foundword it means I'm replacing the previous word  each time. Which is why I'm trying holderlist.append(word).</p>\n\n<p>I think my problem is that I need changeling to run through each word in holderlist, and I'm not sure how to do that.

There's more to the assignment, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, and for the assignment to be considered correct, the linked list must be ordered as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Chevrolet 2012 25\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2012 15\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2013 20\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>from the a text file that has the data ordered the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Ford 2012 15\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2012 20\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Chevrolet 2012 25\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the alphabetical order of the \"make\" field takes precedence, then, the model year is arranged from oldest to newest.</p>\n\n<p>However, the program produces this as the final list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Chevrolet 2012 25\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2012 20\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2012 15\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I sat down with a grad student and tried to work out all of this yesterday, but we just couldn't figure out why it was kicking the Ford nodes down to the end of the list. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the code.

Another our or so, I might've been able to make that work too, but since it already feels like I'm on the wrong road since I can't fix the original 'card in deck/hand/etc' etc, I came here looking for some answers/tips.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and I greatly appreciate any help you can give :)</p>\n\n<p>--------------------- EDIT 1 <em>*</em>></p>\n\n<p>This is my current code:\n<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/g77Y4Tjr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/g77Y4Tjr</a></p>\n\n<p>--------------------- EDIT 2 <em>*</em>></p>\n\n<p>I've tried every single <strong>cmp</strong> advised here, and I still can't get it to find a card with 'in'.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Card(0, 5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Card(0, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Card(3, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand = Hand('Baris')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(a)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(b)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(c)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Card(3, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hand)\nHand Baris contains\n5 of Clubs\n Ace of Clubs\n  Ace of Spades\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d in hand.cards\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also tried the card.py @DSM has used successfully, and I get errors there too, like at the sort function it says it cant compare the two card objects.<br>\nSo I was wondering, maybe it is a problem with Python 3.2, or maybe the syntax has changed somewhere?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","split","sequence","playing-cards"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":2,"question_id":10730350,"title":"Splitting and appending lists in a card game","body":"<p>I am attempting to generate a potential card 'plays' list from a predetermined hand of straights (in this game a straight is defined as 3+ cards - e.g. <code>[3,4,5]</code>).

So far, the data.frames are identical in dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some data to play around with.</p>\n\n<pre><code>sample.list &lt;- list(data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)),\n        data.frame(x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(1:100, 10), capt = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's what I've come up with with the good ol' for loop.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#solution 1\nmy.list &lt;- vector(\"list\", nrow(sample.list[[1]]))\nfor (i in 1:nrow(sample.list[[1]])) {\n    for (j in 1:length(sample.list)) {\n        my.list[[i]] &lt;- rbind(my.list[[i]], sample.list[[j]][i, ])\n    }\n}\n\n#solution 2 (so far my favorite)\nsample.list2 &lt;- do.call(\"rbind\", sample.list)\nmy.list2 &lt;- vector(\"list\", nrow(sample.list[[1]]))\n\nfor (i in 1:nrow(sample.list[[1]])) {\n    my.list2[[i]] &lt;- sample.list2[seq(from = i, to = nrow(sample.list2), by = nrow(sample.list[[1]])), ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can this be improved using vectorization without much brainhurt?
