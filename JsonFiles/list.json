Basically, we have a list of English notations that represent operations in C. They're stored as a list when they're passed to our Prolog program. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add 4 to 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is </p>\n\n<pre><code>[add, 4, to, 3]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We need to write a function that takes that list an returns the equivalent. So if I called</p>\n\n<pre><code>english2C([add,4,to,3], C).\nC = 4+3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It would bind C to the result. So the data structure itself would be something like +(4(3)). We have a list of such English notation we have to translate, so it's a finite number. It's not like we have to account for all possibilities.

I know I can take the very first element of the list and that will always be an operator (+,-,*, etc etc) and then I can just recursively go through the list looking for the operands. The problem there is for things that require order of operations, like \"add 3 to 5 then multiply by 4\", which should be represented as (3+5)*4 but if you just translate it directly you get 3+5*4.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and we have to see if we can get it to run backwards (give it a C statement (3+5) and translate back to english (add 3 to 5)). That part I don't really have an idea for at all.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: There's a large enough permutations of possible English notations that I can't just pattern match everything. I get the idea that what I need to do is match the first operator with it's corresponding arithmetic symbol then find the operands. For a combinational statement, that would be the first part (so I would have 3+5) and then there would be a comma followed by the next statement. By the way, the combinational statements can be as long as they want, so it's not just two statements and I'm done. </p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","list","index"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13279914,"title":"how do I make a list of my postings on Wordpress 3.4.2. and theme Twenty Ten","body":"<p>I've tried to find a solution to allow me to make an \"Index\" of postings I have published (349 posts, 27 pages, 28 categories and 50 tags). \nIs there a simple solution allowing me to display, as a page or post, an \"index\" of ALL posts, pages, etc. with WordPress?\nAn \"Index Page\" where readers and/or subscribers can click on a post/page and be taken to that particular posting.\nI've tried various plugins - (Index Press), (Table of Contents Plus) to mention just a couple but, unless I'm doing something wrong, nothing seems to work for me.   </p>\n"},{"tags":["python","string","list","combinations","vowel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":2,"question_id":13280357,"title":"Finding all combinations of vowel replacements","body":"<p>I am trying to find all possible combinations for all vowels in a word.

I have ten threads, 5 are readers, 5 are writers.<br>\nI used smart pointers to simplify memory management and allow the same object to be contained in multiple lists. \nThe writers are constantly removing and re-inserting objects into their respective list while the readers are periodically iterating through the list.\nIt all seems to work as expected but when calling the list erase member function it is having to find the entry to delete when I already have it.<br>\nIs the erase method smart enough to know the entry to be erased without having to search for it again or is it optimized to eliminate the search when the list element is known? If it does the search, then is there a straightforward way to extend it so a unique lock can be applied only around the actual removal from the list and not also while finding the list element?\nHere is the code I linked with boost 1.51 library and tested with vs2008.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  //******************************************************************************\n  // INCLUDE FILES\n  //******************************************************************************\n  #include &lt;boost/thread.hpp&gt;\n  #include &lt;boost/date_time.hpp&gt;\n  #include &lt;boost/thread/locks.hpp&gt;

I checked the FAQ and I think this qualifies, since it is specific and related to programming.</p>\n\n<p>I'm implementing a complex data mining algorithm (FP-growth) in Java.  Some of the initial phases of the algorithm require me to scan a large database and keep a running count of each item type found.  This seems perfectly suited to a <code>Hashbag</code> interface.  I found one in Apache Commons which seems to work for me.</p>\n\n<p>So now, my HashBag is filled with [itemType, count] entries (pairs).  Later on in the algorithm, I'm required to do a lot of list-like operations on these pairs.  In some cases, I must sort the collection by itemType.  In others, I must sort by count.  This seems perfectly suited to a <code>List</code> interface.</p>\n\n<p>I'm left with the conclusion that I must convert my Hasbag to a List.  Yet it feels dirty somehow, like a waste of space and time.  Is there a smarter way to do this, or is it a common situation to have a programming problem where you must treat your collection differently at different times, and conversions are a necessary evil?</p>\n\n<p>One alternative is to make my own interface which is truly a list, but allows \"bag-style\" adds.  I'd have to keep the list sorted and perform binary searches with a custom comparator every time I wanted to add something.  Building that collection would probably take longer than building a Hashbag, but I'd save on the conversion step at the end.

As a result, you can retrieve the separate section of the output using \"$\" or indexation with square brackets. My question is how I can create an output in list form, without overtly showing that it is a list. As you know, when a list is printed on the screen, it typically has the sub-list name or index indicated, such as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>L1 = list(a=1:3, b=letters[1:3])\nL1\n\n$a\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$b\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, lm() output never shows the different sub-lists using \"$\" and sub-list names - although you can extract these sub-lists using \"$\" and sub-list names.</p>\n\n<p>A second question pertains to the fact that some functions' outputs include much more than what is actually printed on the screen (e.g., lm(), again).

Does the function print something and output something else (using invisible()) separately like below?</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo = function(x){\n   result = list(data=x, test.result=t.test(x))\n   print(result[[2]])\n   invisible(result)\n}\nfoo(1:10)$data\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["list","sass","scss","multiple-background"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13186890,"title":"How do I make a multiple-backgrounds mixin in scss?","body":"<p>Goal: an scss (I'm using v3.2.1) mixin <code>preload</code> used like this (for any number of args > 0):</p>\n\n<pre><code>@include preload(url(\"a.png\"), url(\"b.png\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which outputs the css:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.preload { background-image: url(\"a.png\"), url(\"b.png\"); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Including that comma between them. <del>Some failed attempts, which all produce the sought output <em>minus the comma</em>:</del> <strong>Edit:</strong> It of course turns out I had faulty calls to the mixin, not bugs in the implementation - all three work just fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@mixin preload($img_urls...) {\n  .preload { background-image: $img_urls; }\n}\n\n@mixin preload($img_urls...) {\n  .preload { background-image: join($img_urls, (), comma); }\n}\n\n@mixin preload($img_urls...) {\n  $bgs: nth($img_urls, 1);\n  @for $n from 2 through length($img_urls) {\n    $bgs: $bgs, nth($img_urls, $n); \n  }\n  .preload { background-image: $bgs; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","function","arguments","main"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":0,"question_id":13188134,"title":"how do I get a function to take two arguments?","body":"<p>new to python. so i have this function, and I don't know how to get it to take two arguments and return it in another list with their positions.\nin the main program i want it to call x  to search for in the list, and print the meassage where it occurs. \nam i going about this the right way?\nthis what I came up with.\nwould really appreciate the help\nthanks in advance.</p>\n\n<pre><code>def find_multiple():\n    arg1 = input(\" L: \" )\n    arg2 = input(\" x: \")\n\n    return L\n\ndef main():\n    L = [4, 10, 4, 2, 9, 5, 4 ]\n    x = int(input(\"Enter an element to search for in the list: \"))\n    if (len(L_indexes) == 0):\n        print(x, \" does not occur in L.\")\n        L =[]\n        results = L    \n\nprint(\"enter an element to search for in the list: \" )\nif(len(L) == 0):\n    print(\"element does not occur in the list\")\nelse:\n    print(\"the number of occurrences in L: \", x)\n\nmain()\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","file","list","text"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":1,"question_id":13187130,"title":"Parsing a text file into strings (JAVA)","body":"<p>I am trying to write a coded that reads in a text file into an array list.

But I can have more sometimes</p>\n\n<p>I am btw talking about a function something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public List&lt;MyObject&gt; getMyObjectList() {\n    if (this.myObjects== null) {\n        myObjects = new ArrayList&lt;MyObject&gt;(myObjectsMap.values());\n    }\n    return myObjects;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I could of course do the return like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public List&lt;MyObject&gt; getMyObjectList() {\n        if (this.myObjects== null) {\n            myObjects = new ArrayList&lt;MyObject&gt;(myObjectsMap.values());\n        }\n        return Collections.unmodifiableList(myObjects );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this will break, eventually at several places in different projects / applications.\nIt would imho be the cleanest to return unmodifiable, add javadoc - and fix everything which breaks. But :-D this is work. I'd probably have to test roughly 10 applications.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand I could just return a new list, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public List&lt;MyObject&gt; getMyObjectList() {\n    return new ArrayList&lt;MyObject&gt;(myObjectsMap.values());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is no to little work - but what about the performance issues with this? Other than that - if someone is deleting stuff from the list I returned, it will silently break the application.</p>\n\n<p>So:\nWhat is the performance issue? Is it an issue?</p>\n\n<p>What would you do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","linq","list","mono","accumulate"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":2,"question_id":13123041,"title":"Mono and Linq Aggregate method.

An example implementation follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>W3iCurrencyListener callback = new W3iCurrencyListener() {\n              @Override\n              onRedeem(List&lt;Balance&gt; balances) {\n\n                     //Take possession of the balances returned here.             \n\n              }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The collection of Balance objects may be for different currency types, if your application supports multiple currencies. \nIf the call to redeemCurrency() succeeds, you will receive a collection of balances.  If not, the onRedeem() callback will not fire.  This method will not return currencies unless a user has converted an offer by downloading and installing an application, or completing another action for non-app offers.</p>\n\n<p>But i don't know how to implement this to my app, i have setted up the offerwall, it show and the user can complete offers, but i need to read the postback, giving the value of offer in point to user, can someone help me?</p>\n"}]}

They have been very helpful.\nI've actually run into this situation more than once, and I'd like to give a second example that is unrelated to inheritance.  This is actually a real-world example, and though I've decided my current project is small scale enough to be safe with using vectors based on your answers,  it's a concept that I imagine I'll use on a much larger scale at some point.</p>\n\n<p>In creating an engine for my current Android game project, I found it necessary to create an Imagepoint object that is basically a set of XY coordinates that are used to track significant parts of a sprite image.  Say you have a bone character made up of several bitmaps, it's useful to know where the neck attaches to the torso, the forearm to the bicep, etc.  This xy offset data is used later to calculate the position for various purposes, such as where to position other sprites by using trigonometric functions to find the xy offset given the current angle.</p>\n\n<p>Most sprite objects will need only one image point.  The bicep needs one for the forearm, the forearm needs one for the hand, the neck needs one for the head, etc.  The torsos in my current character models are the exception, and they need several for the shoulders, the legs, the neck, and any removable decorative sprites. </p>\n\n<p>The sprite is the object that contains the imagepoint vectors, there will be no inherited classes, because each : torso, leg, etc is simply an instance of the sprite class, which is strictly a graphical object, containing a pointer to the bitmap, these imagepoints, and assorted position/orientation data, and will not be used for any specialized purposes. If I were to use this concept on a large scale game with massive numbers of instances, where most would require only a single imagepoint, with a few objects requiring several or none, and where there would be no special cases meriting the use of inheritance.

How can I do this in Flex 3.5 and Actionscript and have a button that when clicked, display a list of the checked items??</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","dictionary"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":1,"question_id":13046313,"title":"python assigning a list to a dictionary returns empty list","body":"<p>I have an issue whereby my list frameChain is being reflected as empty (<code>[]</code>). <code>frameChain</code> is actually a list such as: <code>['C Level', 'Medium Term']</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>jsonOut[x]= {'TEXT' : node.attrib['TEXT'],\n             'ID': node.attrib['ID'],\n             'Sessions' : frameChain,}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tried this outside of the function I defined and it seemed to work just fine.

Rather than storing the count and total in the struct, and then computing the average upon output, I'd like to store the count and average in the struct, thus discarding my quantity value after the average has been recalculated.  My struct looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct mystruct \n{\n    string item;\n    long avg;\n    short count;\n} data;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These structs are stored in a list, with an iterator, <code>it</code>, that allows me to move through the list.

Start at an arbitrary node (the first node will do) and \nadd all of its links onto a list.  \n\n2.

Every game tick, the System calls a specified method over all of its Components. Components are e.g. Physics, Terrain, Draw, Characters, Sound, ...

I can do this by using the built in-predict append(List, NumberOfSteps, List2) and then passing List2 down through the recursion and printing it at the end, but List and List2 aren't unified there and the actual answer that Prolog gives me is List = [] ; true</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling I might be approaching the problem the wrong way but I'm stuck!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":0,"question_id":12893091,"title":"flatten list in python","body":"<p>I want to flatten the list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>exampleArray = [[[151.68694121866872]], \n                [[101.59534468349297]], \n                [[72.16055999176308]]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[151.68694121866872, 101.59534468349297, 72.16055999176308]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right now I am doing this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>resultArray= list(chain.from_iterable(list(chain.from_iterable(exampleArray))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though it works I wanted to know if there's a better way.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","parsing","configparser"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12894094,"title":"How can I get the values of every item in a section?","body":"<p>I have a configuration file with one section, and multiple items with different values.

The values \"Ford\" (for make), \"2012\" (for year), and \"12\" (for the newStock field) are hard-coded into the function \"Main\", and are sent down to the \"updateStockOfCar\" function, which is the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int updateStockOfCar(Record *head, char *make, int year, int newStock)\n{\n        if(head == NULL)\n        {\n            printf(\"The list is empty\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        Record * matching = malloc(sizeof(Record));\n        matching-&gt;make = make;\n        matching-&gt;year = year;\n\n        //If the first record is the one we want to modify, then do so\n        if(strcmp(head-&gt;make, matching-&gt;make) == 0)\n        {\n            if(head-&gt;year == matching-&gt;year)\n            {\n                head-&gt;stock = newStock;\n                return 1;\n            }\n\n            Record* previous = head;\n            Record* current = head-&gt;next;\n\n                //Loop through the list, looking for the record to update\n            while(current != NULL)\n            {\n                if(strcmp(current-&gt;make, matching-&gt;make) == 0 &amp;&amp; current-&gt;year  == matching-&gt;year)\n                {\n                    current-&gt;stock = newStock;\n                    return 1;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    previous = current;\n                    current = current -&gt; next;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, this function takes in the head node of the list (where we start our search for the correct node to update), make &amp; year (for the node we're targeting to modify the stock of), and newStock (the value we're going to use to replace the standard \"stock\" field in the targeted node). </p>\n\n<p>Our first case is if head is NULL, in which case, we say that the list is empty and return an unsuccessful \"0\" back to the calling variable in \"Main\".  </p>\n\n<p>Our second case is if the strcmp between the make fields in head in matching are the same, and the year fields in head and matching are the same, then we update head's stock field to newStock and return a successful \"1\" back to funciton \"Main\". In essence, if the head node is the right node to modify, we do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our third case is if the head node is NOT the correct node to modify. On the condition that current (defined as the head to start with) is not NULL, we compare the current node's make and year fields to the targeted node we want to change.

But if you consider a tougher set of words, like Java and work, the output is supposed to be in 6 steps. </p>\n\n<pre><code>['java', 'lava', 'lave', 'wave', 'wove', 'wore', 'work']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my mistake is that I didn't realize you could get to the target word, by using letters that don't exist in the target word or original word. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my Original Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import string\ndef changeling(word,target,steps):\n    alpha=string.ascii_lowercase\n    x=word##word and target has been changed to keep the coding readable.\n    z=target\n    if steps==0 and word!= target:##if the target can't be reached, return nothing.\n        return []\n    if x==z:##if target has been reached.\n        return [z]\n\n\n    if len(word)!=len(target):##if the word and target word aren't the same length print error.\n        print \"error\"\n        return None\n    i=1\n    if lookup\n    if lookup(z[0]+x[1:]) is True and z[0]+x[1:]!=x :##check every letter that could be from z, in variations of, and check if they're in the dictionary.\n        word=z[0]+x[1:]\n    while i!=len(x):\n        if lookup(x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]) and x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]!=x:\n            word=x[:i-1]+z[i-1]+x[i:]\n\n        i+=1\n    if lookup(x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(word)-1]) and x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(x)-1]!=x :##same applies here.\n        word=x[:len(x)-1]+z[len(word)-1]\n\n\n    y =  changeling(word,target,steps-1)\n    if y :\n      return [x] + y##used to concatenate the first word to the final list, and if the list goes past the amount of steps.\n    else:\n      return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's my current code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import string\ndef changeling(word,target,steps):\n    alpha=string.ascii_lowercase\n    x=word##word and target has been changed to keep the coding readable.\n    z=target\n    if steps==0 and word!= target:##if the target can't be reached, return nothing.\n        return []\n    if x==z:##if target has been reached.\n        return [z]\n    holderlist=[]\n\n\n    if len(word)!=len(target):##if the word and target word aren't the same length print error.\n        print \"error\"\n        return None\n    i=1\n    for items in alpha:\n\n        i=1\n        while i!=len(x):\n            if lookup(x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]) is True and x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]!=x:\n                word =x[:i-1]+items+x[i:]\n                holderlist.append(word)\n\n            i+=1\n        if lookup(x[:len(x)-1]+items) is True and x[:len(x)-1]+items!=x:\n            word=x[:len(x)-1]+items\n            holderlist.append(word)\n\n    y =  changeling(word,target,steps-1)\n    if y :\n      return [x] + y##used to concatenate the first word to the final list, and if the/\n   list goes past the amount of steps.\n    else:\n      return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The differences between the two is that the first checks every variation of find with the letters from lose. Meaning: lind, fond, fisd, and fine. Then, if it finds a working word with the lookup function, it calls changeling on that newfound word.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to my new program, which checks every variation of find with every single letter in the alphabet. </p>\n\n<p>I can't seem to get this code to work. I've tested it by simply printing what the results are of find: </p>\n\n<pre><code>for items in alpha:\n\n        i=1\n        while i!=len(x):\n             print (x[:i-1]+items+x[i:])\n\n             i+=1\n        print (x[:len(x)-1]+items)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This gives:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aind\nfand\nfiad\nfina\nbind\nfbnd\nfibd\nfinb\ncind\nfcnd\nficd\nfinc\ndind\nfdnd\nfidd\nfind\neind\nfend\nfied\nfine\nfind\nffnd\nfifd\nfinf\ngind\nfgnd\nfigd\nfing\nhind\nfhnd\nfihd\nfinh\niind\nfind\nfiid\nfini\njind\nfjnd\nfijd\nfinj\nkind\nfknd\nfikd\nfink\nlind\nflnd\nfild\nfinl\nmind\nfmnd\nfimd\nfinm\nnind\nfnnd\nfind\nfinn\noind\nfond\nfiod\nfino\npind\nfpnd\nfipd\nfinp\nqind\nfqnd\nfiqd\nfinq\nrind\nfrnd\nfird\nfinr\nsind\nfsnd\nfisd\nfins\ntind\nftnd\nfitd\nfint\nuind\nfund\nfiud\nfinu\nvind\nfvnd\nfivd\nfinv\nwind\nfwnd\nfiwd\nfinw\nxind\nfxnd\nfixd\nfinx\nyind\nfynd\nfiyd\nfiny\nzind\nfznd\nfizd\nfinz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is perfect! Notice that each letter in the alphabet goes through my word at least once. Now, what my program does is use a helper function to determine if that word is in a dictionary that I've been given.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this, instead of like my first program, I now receive multiple words that are legal, except when I do word=foundword it means I'm replacing the previous word  each time. Which is why I'm trying holderlist.append(word).</p>\n\n<p>I think my problem is that I need changeling to run through each word in holderlist, and I'm not sure how to do that.

There's more to the assignment, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, and for the assignment to be considered correct, the linked list must be ordered as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Chevrolet 2012 25\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2012 15\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2013 20\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>from the a text file that has the data ordered the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Ford 2012 15\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2012 20\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Chevrolet 2012 25\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the alphabetical order of the \"make\" field takes precedence, then, the model year is arranged from oldest to newest.</p>\n\n<p>However, the program produces this as the final list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Chevrolet 2012 25\n    Chevrolet 2013 10\n    Honda 2011 9\n    Honda 2012 3\n    Honda 2013 12\n    Toyota 2009 2\n    Toyota 2011 7\n    Toyota 2012 20\n    Ford 2010 5\n    Ford 2011 3\n    Ford 2012 15\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I sat down with a grad student and tried to work out all of this yesterday, but we just couldn't figure out why it was kicking the Ford nodes down to the end of the list. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the code.

Another our or so, I might've been able to make that work too, but since it already feels like I'm on the wrong road since I can't fix the original 'card in deck/hand/etc' etc, I came here looking for some answers/tips.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and I greatly appreciate any help you can give :)</p>\n\n<p>--------------------- EDIT 1 <em>*</em>></p>\n\n<p>This is my current code:\n<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/g77Y4Tjr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/g77Y4Tjr</a></p>\n\n<p>--------------------- EDIT 2 <em>*</em>></p>\n\n<p>I've tried every single <strong>cmp</strong> advised here, and I still can't get it to find a card with 'in'.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Card(0, 5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Card(0, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Card(3, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand = Hand('Baris')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(a)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(b)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add(c)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Card(3, 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hand)\nHand Baris contains\n5 of Clubs\n Ace of Clubs\n  Ace of Spades\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d in hand.cards\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also tried the card.py @DSM has used successfully, and I get errors there too, like at the sort function it says it cant compare the two card objects.<br>\nSo I was wondering, maybe it is a problem with Python 3.2, or maybe the syntax has changed somewhere?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","split","sequence","playing-cards"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":2,"question_id":10730350,"title":"Splitting and appending lists in a card game","body":"<p>I am attempting to generate a potential card 'plays' list from a predetermined hand of straights (in this game a straight is defined as 3+ cards - e.g. <code>[3,4,5]</code>).

We can implement a lazy sort that returns a stream representing the sorted list. Each time the stream is accessed to get the head of the sorted list, the smallest element is found in the list.

Help.</p>\n\n<h1>My main program:</h1>\n\n<pre><code>include &lt;iostream&gt;\ninclude \"doublyLinkedList.h\"\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid displayBackward(DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *ptr);\nvoid displayForward(DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *ptr);\n\nint main()\n{\n   DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *ptr, *head, *tail;\n\n   ptr = new DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt;;\n\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"Testing Insert\\n\";\n   ptr-&gt;insert(4);\n   ptr-&gt;insert(2);\n   ptr-&gt;insert(3);\n   ptr-&gt;insert(1);\n\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n\\nTesting displayForward\\n\";\n   head = ptr-&gt;getNext();\n   displayForward(head);\n\n\n   tail = ptr;\n   while (tail-&gt;getNext() != NULL)\n      tail = tail-&gt;getNext();\n\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n\\nTesting displayBackward\\n\";\n   displayBackward(tail);\n\n   /*\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n\\nRemoving value 2\\n\";\n   ptr-&gt;remove(2);\n   ptr-&gt;display();\n\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n\\nRemoving value 1\\n\";\n   ptr-&gt;remove(1);\n   ptr-&gt;display();\n   */\n\n   delete ptr;\n\n   system( \"pause\" );\n   return 0;\n}\n\n\nvoid displayBackward(DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *ptr) {\n   DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *tmp;\n\n   tmp = ptr;\n   while (tmp != NULL)\n   {\n      cout &lt;&lt; tmp-&gt;getData() &lt;&lt; endl;\n      tmp = tmp-&gt;getPrevious();\n   }\n}\n\nvoid displayForward(DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *ptr)\n{\n   DoublyLinkedList&lt;int&gt; *tmp;\n\n   tmp = ptr;\n   while (tmp != NULL)\n   {\n      cout &lt;&lt; tmp-&gt;getData() &lt;&lt; endl;\n      tmp = tmp-&gt;getNext();\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>My DoublyLinkedList.h and functions:</h1>\n\n<pre><code>ifndef DOUBLY_LINKED_LIST_H\ndefine DOUBLY_LINKED_LIST_H\n\ninclude &lt;iostream&gt;\ninclude &lt;fstream&gt;\n\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nclass DoublyLinkedList\n{\n   private:\n      T                   mData;\n      DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; *mPrevious;\n      DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; *mNext;\n\n   public:\n      DoublyLinkedList();\n      DoublyLinkedList(T data);\n      ~DoublyLinkedList();\n\n      T                   getData();\n      DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; *getNext();\n      DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; *getPrevious();\n\n      void setData(T data);\n\n      void display();\n      void insert(T data);\n      bool isExist(T searchKey);\n      void remove(T searchKey);\n\n      bool operator&lt;(T rhs);\n      friend bool operator&lt;(T lhs, DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; rhs);\n\n      bool operator&gt;(T rhs);\n      friend bool operator&gt;(T lhs, DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; rhs);\n\n      bool operator==(T rhs);\n      friend bool operator==(T lhs, DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; rhs);\n\n      bool operator!=(T rhs);\n      friend bool operator!=(T lhs, DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; rhs);\n\n      friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;outputStream, DoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; obj);\n};\n\n\n/********** Constructors **********/\n\n/*      Pre:  None\n *     Post:  The next and previous pointers are initialized to NULL\n *  Purpose:  Default constructor\n******************************************************************************/\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nDoublyLinkedList&lt;T&gt;::DoublyLinkedList()\n{\n    //There is nothing before or after this node yet.

Actually, write two functions called \"odd\" and \"even\". odd(L) returns a list of the 1st,3rd,5th... items in L. even(L) returns a list of the 2nd,4th,6th... items in L. And each function calls the other. These two functions are based on a simple observation. L.next is like L, but with the first item missing. If we take away the first item, item N+1 becomes item N. So the 2nd,3rd,4th elements of L are the 1st,2nd,3rd elements of L.next. Now if N+1 is odd, N is even, while if N+1 is even N is odd. So the odd members of L.next are even members of L, and the even members of L.next are odd members of L. Then we can compute odd(L) as follows. If L is null return null. Otherwise return a list whose first item is L.item, while its tail is even(L.next). To compute even(L): If L is null return null. Otherwise return odd(L.next). Your main function should read a list of positive integers from the command line, with -1 terminating the list. It should form a linked list containing these integers, compute the list of odd members, and print them.</p>\n\n<p>my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class linkedlist\n{\npublic static void main(String[] args) \n{\n\n  List odd = new ArrayList();\n  List even = new ArrayList();\n  odd(L, odd, even);\n}\nvoid odd(L curNode, ArrayList oddList, ArrayList evenList) \n{\n\n   if (curNode == null) return;\n\n\n   oddList.append(curNode.val);\n   even(curNode, oddList, evenList);\n}\n\nvoid even(L curNode, ArrayList oddList, ArrayList evenList) \n{\n   if (curNode == null || curNode.next == null) return;\n\n\n   evenList.append(curNode.n ext.val);\n   odd(curNode.next.next, oddList, evenList);\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["list","collections","hashset"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12679964,"title":"Whats the most effective way to store a chemical formula?","body":"<p>I currently have have a HashSet of <code>NElement</code> objects.

Then, once I am done, clear the values of the variables in the array vars so that it is in its original form {x,y,z} (and not something like {x,1,3} where y=1 and z=3). I want to do this by referring to the positional elements of vars (I aim not to know that x, y and z are the actual variables).</p>\n\n<p>The reason why: I am trying to write a program that can have any number of variables and ODEs as defined by the user. Since the number of variables and the actual letters used for them are unknown, it is necessary to perform manipulations with the array itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attempt:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>A fixed number of variables is easy. For the arbitrary case, I have tried modules and blocks, but with no success. Consider the following code: </p>\n\n<p><code>Clear[x,y,z,vars,svars]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>vars={x,y,z}</code></p>\n\n<p><code>svars=Map[ToString,vars]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Module[{vars=vars,svars=svars},</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Symbol[svars[[1]]]//Evaluate=1</code></p>\n\n<p><code>]</code></p>\n\n<p>then vars={1,y,z} and not {x,y,z} after running this. I have done functional programming with lists, atoms etc. Thus is makes sense to me that vars is changed afterwards, because I have changed x and not vars. However, I cannot get \"x\" in the list of variables to remain local. Of course I could put in \"x\" itself, but that is particular to this specific case. I would prefer to put something like: </p>\n\n<p><code>Clear[x,y,z,vars,svars]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>vars={x,y,z}</code></p>\n\n<p><code>svars=Map[ToString,vars]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Module[{vars=vars,svars=svars, vars[[1]]},</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Symbol[svars[[1]]]//Evaluate=1</code></p>\n\n<p><code>]</code></p>\n\n<p>which of course doesn't work because vars[[1]] is not a symbol or an assignment to a symbol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other possibilities:</strong> \nI found a function </p>\n\n<p><code>assignToName[name_String, value_] :=</code>\n<code>ToExpression[name, InputForm, Function[var, var = value, HoldAll]]</code></p>\n\n<p>which looked promising. Basically name_String is the name of the variable and value is its new value.

Thanks for any and all help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I failed to mention, that the purpose of the function utilizing these steps is to fine the MAX of _pumpOneSpm &amp; _pumpTwoSpm.  Not the max of each, but the max between them.  Thus initially I was adding them into a single list and just calling spmOne.Max().  But with two LINQ queries like above, I'm running an if statement to compare the two maxes, and then return the greater of the two.

The lists need not have any common elements at all, and one or both may be empty.  [<em>Clarification: You may assume no repetitions of elements.</em>]</p>\n\n<p>The problem is to produce a sort of \"diff\" of the lists, which may be viewed as new list of ordered pairs <code>(x,y)</code> where <code>x</code> is from <code>L</code> and <code>y</code> is from <code>R</code>, with the following properties:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If <code>x</code> appears in both lists, then <code>(x,x)</code> appears in the result.</li>\n<li>If <code>x</code> appears in <code>L</code>, but not in <code>R</code>, then <code>(x,NULL)</code> appears in the result.</li>\n<li>If <code>y</code> appears in <code>R</code>, but not in <code>L</code>, then <code>(NULL,y)</code> appears in the result.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>and finally</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The result list has \"the same\" ordering as each of the input lists: it shares, roughly speaking, the same ordering property as above with each of the lists individually (see example).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Examples</h1>\n\n<pre><code>L = (d)\nR = (a,b,c)\nResult = ((NULL,d), (a,NULL), (b,NULL), (c,NULL))\n\nL = (a,b,c,d,e)  \nR = (b,q,c,d,g,e)\nResult = ((a,NULL), (b,b), (NULL,q), (c,c), (d,d), (NULL,g), (e,e))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any good algorithms to solve this?

Generally, the input is a string, consisting of g groups of repeated letters, each group k_n letters long. </p>\n\n<p>My intuition is that this is a recursive algorithm, but the exact structure of it has been difficult to understand. </p>\n"},{"tags":["python","list","variables","import"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":4,"question_id":12374798,"title":"Importing a 3-D list variable from a text file in Python","body":"<p>I need to know if I can easily assign a variable within my script from a declaration in a text file.

I will certainly add methods later on but for now I have what I need.</p>\n\n<p>So my first question to you is: Is it a correct code: <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/0BCbyNqJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/0BCbyNqJ</a>\nDoes that class look clean enough to you?</p>\n\n<p>And my second question is about these exceptions I am throwing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Oldest item added to the list\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic T First\n{\n    get\n    {\n        if (_head &lt; 0)\n            throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(\"The list is empty\");\n\n        if (_firstRoundDone)\n            return _array[(_head + 1) % _max];\n        else\n            return _array[0];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Before anything is added to my list, I would like calls to <code>First</code>, <code>Last</code> and <code>Count</code>to return null. I think that would make more sense. But I don't know how to do so since the return types are int or T, for which I don't want to add a constraint like <code>where T:Nullable</code>.\nAs I don't see any solution I wonder if the Exception is not, afterall, the most elegant way. Or should I implement methods like <code>GetFirst(out T first)</code> or even <code>TryGetFirst(out T)</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","list","stored-procedures"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":12294381,"title":"How to create an sp returning a list of boolean?","body":"<p>I would like to build a stored procedure which can return the value 0 or 1 depending if the day of today is in the list of date.

This keyboard has volume buttons that require a driver to function. This driver has not been updated since 2006, and I suspect it as the source of a recent spat of recurring kernel panics I've been experiencing under Mac OS X 10.6.1. So, out it goes; but I want my volume keys back!</p>\n\n<p>Using the wonderful <a href=\"http://controllermate.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">ControllerMate</a>, I can program these keys to do anything, including run an applescript script. So, I'm trying to implement that functionality.</p>\n\n<p>The set volume command (part of Standard Additions) allows you to set the volume to any value between 0 and 100. The Apple keyboard volume keys allow a total of 17 volume settings to be selected (including 0). I figure the simplest way to duplicate this behavior is to keep a list of allowed volume settings and grab the next largest (or smallest) one out of that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>It doesn't work. The following script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>set volumesList to {0, 6, 12, 18, 25, 31, 37, 43, 50, 56, 62, 68, 75, 81, 87, 93, 100}\nset sysVolume to get volume settings\n\nrepeat with curVolume in volumesList\n    if (curVolume &gt; (output volume of sysVolume)) then\n    \tset volume output volume (contents of curVolume)\n    \texit repeat\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nget volume settings\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...only works if the system volume level happens to be less than 43. The system seems to interpret \"50\" as \"49\"; that's as high as the volume will go with my script. If the volume <em>starts</em> higher than 50, my script has no effect. The kicker? If the \"exit repeat\" statement is removed, the system volume gets set to 100 - just as you'd expect.</p>\n\n<p>(Good grief, AppleScript is <em>weird</em> sometimes.)</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>\n\n<p>It would be super awesome to get this to display the volume overlay as well.
