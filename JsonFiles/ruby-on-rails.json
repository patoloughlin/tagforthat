I don't want to have to create fixtures manually for things like sample data that would take a long time.</p>\n\n<p>When we deploy I want to be able to just run</p>\n\n<pre><code>rake db:migrate\nrake db:fixtures:load\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And be off to the races.</p>\n\n<p>What is the best/preferred method for doing this in rails?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>So it seems there is no standard way to do an opposite rake task of db:fixtures:load.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to use migrations, because I want a standard way of doing this for all my projects, and I don't like the idea of putting any more than maybe the admin account in a migration. Second, I've been rethinking the idea of using the fixtures. I've decided on using yaml_db because it uses rake tasks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>rake db:data:dump\nrake db:data:load\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The data will wind up in a YAML file without distrupting test fixtures (which could be different, now that I think about this more carefully). Also, if a major distribution tool like Heroku is using it, I don't have to worry about support/longevity issues. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose this is closest to \"standard\" that I will find.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all the great responses.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby-on-rails-3","solr","sunspot"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13280386,"title":"friendly SEO urls with sunspot and rails 3","body":"<p>How can create SEO friendly url using using sunspot?</p>\n\n<p>I want to convert a search from this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://localhost:3000/restaurant?utf8=&amp;search=newyork\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://localhost:3000/restaurant/newyork\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby-on-rails-3","twitter-bootstrap","radio-button"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11,"score":0,"question_id":13281194,"title":"Radio Button Selection Sticking After Search","body":"<p>This question is similar to my last question, but instead of a select box I would like to implement it on two radio buttons.

In the <a href=\"http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a>, at the 10th chapter, the author has 2 controllers in one view. I build a similar app in which I also have 2 controllers in one view, however, when I render a method, which belongs to the second controller, from the first I have problems with the params. (in the tutorial the author does not use any parameters in the action of the other controller)</p>\n\n<p>More specifically I have 2 controllers: UsersController and MicropostsController. Also, in the show.html.haml page of Users, I use both controllers: UsersController for showing user's microposts and MicropostsController in order to allow the user to create a new micropost.</p>\n\n<p>Inside MicropostsController:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def create\n  @micropost = current_user.microposts.build(params[:micropost])\n  if @micropost.save\n    flash[:success] = \"Micropost created!\"\n    redirect_to user_path(current_user)\n  else\n    #render text: renderActionInOtherController(UsersController,:show, {:id =&gt; 1})\n    @user = User.find(current_user)\n    @microposts = @user.microposts.paginate(page: params[:page])\n    render 'users/show'\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Inside UsersController</p>\n\n<pre><code>def show\n  @user = User.find(params[:id])\n  @microposts = @user.microposts.paginate(page: params[:page])\n  @micropost = current_user.microposts.build if signed_in?\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the app/views/users/show.html.haml</p>\n\n<pre><code>- provide(:title, @user.name)\n.users_page\n  .row\n    %aside.span4\n      - if !signed_in?\n        %section\n          %h1\n            = gravatar_for @user\n            = @user.name\n      - else\n        %section\n          = render 'shared/user_info'\n        %section\n          = render 'shared/micropost_form'\n\n    .span8\n      - if @user.microposts.any?\n        %h3 Microposts (#{@user.microposts.count})\n        %ol.microposts\n          = render @microposts\n        = will_paginate @microposts\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So basically my question summarizes as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1)Is it a good practice to have multiple controllers in 1 view? I have found contradicting answers in the net. (actually, I am not even sure if this code remains RESTful)</p>\n\n<p>2) If 1 is yes (or at least it is not a bad practice) could I implement the same thing in a more efficient way? Because the way I see it, every time I render action from another controller, I have to redefine the variables.</p>\n\n<p>3) I found a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6051776/rails-3-render-action-from-another-controller\">similar</a> topic in stackoverflow in which one proposes to use this method (which I don't get what it does exactly since I am new in RoR).</p>\n\n<pre><code>def renderActionInOtherController(controller,action,params)\n  controller.class_eval{\n    def params=(params); @params = params end\n    def params; @params end\n  }\n  c = controller.new\n  c.request = @_request\n  c.response = @_response\n  c.params = params\n  c.send(action)\n  c.response.body\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I use this version of create action inside MicropostsController, </p>\n\n<pre><code>def create\n  @micropost = current_user.microposts.build(params[:micropost])\n  if @micropost.save\n    flash[:success] = \"Micropost created!\"\n    redirect_to user_path(current_user)\n  else\n    render text: renderActionInOtherController(UsersController,:show, {:id =&gt; 1})\n    #@user = User.find(current_user)\n    #@microposts = @user.microposts.paginate(page: params[:page])\n    #render 'users/show'\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when I hit post button I get totally nothing in the browser. Moreover, when I try to view tha users/1 page I get the following error(!!):</p>\n\n<pre><code>undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help will be really valuable!

ActiveRecord automatically generates a transaction when for example <code>:create</code> or <code>:destroy</code> are called on an ActiveRecord based object. In our RSpec suite we're using Machinist factories to create our test data for every test. Now in case we're testing functionality that creates it's own transaction, we face the problem, that the begin-commit cycle of our <code>Factory.make!</code> call inside a test not only quits the inner transaction (opened by <code>:create</code>) but also quits the transaction that was opened inside the tested code. In result the rollback triggered by db_cleaner can not roll back anything, and we still have our test data inside our database after a test ran. </p>\n\n<p>I think somebody must have faced this problem already.

The problem comes in with the rails helpers, like <code>image_tag</code> in the above example. The view example correctly displays an image in a div, and the code example displays the relevant HTML. In this case, the relevant HTML includes an anchor tag - the results of the <code>image_tag</code> method, not the call itself.</p>\n\n<p>I would prefer the code examples to display the helper methods, rather that their results. I am able to make this work by specifying the example code in a file, and either rendering or reading the file. I would prefer to make this work by specifying the code in a variable, as above, but I can't seem to get an ERB delimiter to work inside of a string inside of an erb block. Even the simplest case of <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> doesn't work at all. I've tried playing with the syntax (<code>&lt;%% %%&gt;</code> and <code>% %</code> for example), using details from the <a href=\"http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, without much success.</p>\n\n<p>The only information I could find on the matter is <a href=\"http://markmail.org/message/gpz5bpqvbclogo7a\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, using <code>&lt;%= \"&lt;\" + \"%=\" %&gt; link_to &lt;%= image.css_tag.humanize %&gt; &lt;%= \"%\" + \"&gt;\" %&gt; %&gt;</code>, which does not work in this use case (if at all).</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a way to specify a string that contains a ERB end-delimiter (<code>%&gt;</code>) in an ERB string, or am I stuck using the slightly clunkier file-read method? Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I would like to end up with is a working version of this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%# Idealized code - does not work %&gt;\n&lt;% code = &lt;&lt;PLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;% image_tag 'image.png' %&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;  \nPLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that <code>&lt;%= raw code %&gt;</code> would (continue to) output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"/images/image.png\" alt=\"Image\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And <code>&lt;%= content_tag :pre, code, class: \"prettyprint linenums\" %&gt;</code> would output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;% image_tag 'image.png' %&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;  \n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of what it currently does when using a variable, which is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/image.png\" alt=\"Image\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want users to be able to copy the code example and paste it into a new view, without having to translate HTML back into the helpers that produce them. I think what I basically need is an alternative ERB delimiter, in the same way that <code>'</code> and <code>\"</code> (or even <code>%q{}</code>) vary for strings. It seems that even though the final ERB delimiter is occurring inside of a string, it is being actually processed as the end of the block. The simplest case of <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> demonstrates somewhat what I want to accomplish. In a generator, you might use <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> (or something similar), to tell it not to process as ERB right then and there. This all works fine when reading from a file, or even in a pure rb file (like a helper), but it makes the most sense to put it in the view, in this case, as it is intended to be easily manipulated by our designers.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","ruby-on-rails","frontend","shopify"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":112,"score":1,"question_id":11936268,"title":"How to develop rails app for shopify with ScriptTags","body":"<p>I have a shopify app deployed in Heroku, developed in Rails. \nI need call a javascript function from any shopify store's frontend.\nI've read this article ( <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/technology/3033852-shopify-api-update-scripttags-javascript-insertion\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.shopify.com/technology/3033852-shopify-api-update-scripttags-javascript-insertion</a> ), but I don't understand it... </p>\n\n<p>Where do I have to put this code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP POST http://their-shop.myshopify.com/admin/scripttags\n\n  &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n  &lt;script-tag&gt;\n    &lt;src&gt;http://example.com/your-awesome-script.js&lt;/src&gt;\n    &lt;event&gt;onload&lt;/event&gt;\n  &lt;/script-tag&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What should be the src tag (for my deployed rails app),\nand where should I put the javascript call function? </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13264208,"title":"group by in active records","body":"<p>I have one instance variable with two records. </p>\n\n<pre><code>           id   item_with_detail_id  quantity\n\n           100       205                3\n\n\n           101       205                5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, i want the result as follows using Active record group_by .</p>\n\n<pre><code>           100       205                8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i tried with </p>\n\n<pre><code>@bill_details=@bill_details.group_by{|bd| bd.item_with_detail_id}.values.map(&amp;:first)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but its not working.

Thus, modifying all the specified account balances. </p>\n\n<p>Below is the steps I took in going about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> In transaction model (transaction.rb model) define process method </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Transaction &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n    def proc (transaction) \n        # Code processes transactions\n        @account = Account.find(transaction.from_account)\n        @account.balance = @account.balance - transaction.amount\n        @account.update_attributes(params[:account]) #update the new balance\nend\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Then create a method in transaction controller call execute</p>\n\n<pre><code>def execute\n      @transaction = Transaction.find(params[:id])\n    proc (@transaction)\n    @transaction.destroy\n\n      respond_to do |format|\n      format.html { redirect_to transactions_url }\n      format.json { head :no_content }\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Then define the a link to display on the transaction page (shown below):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;% @transactions.each do |transaction| %&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= transaction.from_account %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= transaction.amount %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= transaction.to_account %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Execute', transaction, confirm: 'Are you sure?', method: :execute %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', transaction %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_transaction_path(transaction) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Destroy', transaction, confirm: 'Are you sure?', method: :delete %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= transaction.id%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4) But when I click the Execute link I get the routing error:\n[POST] \"/transactions/6\"</p>\n\n<p>Currently my routes(routes.rb) are setup as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>resources :transactions do\n       member do\n       post :execute\n       end\n   end\n\n  resources :accounts\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I setup the routes so that it may process my method?\nThanks in advance </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","omniauth"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13210062,"title":"Enabling users to enter their email when they login with Twitter (OmniAuth)","body":"<p>I'm using <a href=\"https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\">omniauth-twitter</a> and I have everything set up:</p>\n\n<p><strong>user.rb:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>  def self.create_with_omniauth(auth)\n    create! do |user|\n      user.provider = auth[\"provider\"]\n      user.uid = auth[\"uid\"]\n      user.name = auth[\"info\"][\"name\"]\n      user.email = auth[\"info\"][\"email\"]\n      # To pass password validation\n      user.password = user.password_confirmation = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(n=6) \n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>sessions_controller.rb:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code> def create\n    user = User.find_by_email(params[:session][:email].downcase)\n    if user &amp;&amp; user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])\n      sign_in user\n      redirect_back_or user\n    else\n      flash.now[:error] = 'Invalid email/password combination'\n      render 'new'\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that you can't retrieve an email address from Twitter, so the login fails because of my validation rules:</p>\n\n<p><strong>user.rb:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code> before_save { |user| user.email = email.downcase }\n  before_save :create_remember_token\n\n  validates :name, presence: true, length: { maximum: 50 }\n  VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\\A[\\w+\\-.]+@[a-z\\d\\-.]+\\.[a-z]+\\z/i\n  validates :email, presence:   true,\n                    format:     { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX },\n                    uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }\n  validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6 }\n  validates :password_confirmation, presence: true \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to enable users to enter an email so they can login without failing the validation (only with Twitter, since I have Facebook and Google login too).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestion?

There is to be a dropdown menu to select what timezone you want times to be displayed for. Once you have selected the timezone, that selection needs to now persist so during that session, any time values for that user that is displayed is in that timezone.</p>\n\n<p>I already have a nice function that my date formatting goes through in a helper module for the ApplicationController where I can apply the timezone and it is automatically applied to all dates displayed. However, a problem I am having is that while I need this data to be sent via POST, I also need to not be reliant on some kind of backend storage to make the select persist. The nature of the site I am doing this for is more or less just a frontend for multiple services so it has no databases of its own. It just makes service calls and displays the data received. This becomes a problem because most of the examples I've seen of session usage compares the session values to model values extended from ActiveRecord. On this site, ActiveRecord isn't even used.</p>\n\n<p>I realize the two things might be irrelevant, but it makes the learning process a bit harder when all the example code compares cookie data to model data when I effectively had no persistent model. Also I still don't quite understand the \"Rails Magic\" that determines what gets forwarded through in the params hash.</p>\n\n<p>So is there a simple way to have a dropdown selection that just stores the selection in a cookie and future renders for that user can be based on that cookie information without comparing the cookie data to some persistent model data?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: A commenter asked if there is a reason why AJAX can't be used. The answer is that there is no reason other than that I have never used AJAX before, so I would probably need some explanation to make it work. I thought AJAX was just a way to make queries without leaving the page, but the page needs to reload anyways after a selection is made, and more importantly it should re-render the same page that it was on previously with the new settings.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","json","sinatra","rabl"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12593535,"title":"RABL renders ActiveRecord timestamps or datetimes as numbers instead of strings","body":"<p>I'm currently in the process of switching from ActiveRecord's <code>as_json</code> to RABL for API generation.</p>\n\n<p><code>as_json</code> has been rendering timestamps in my models as strings of the format <code>2012-09-16T22:14:11+00:00</code>.

While this deployment model worked fine for Rails2 (with frozen gems, etc.), it breaks in many painful ways for Rails3 with Bundler.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I'm seeing gem dependency errors for gems in :test and :development groups even when deploying to :production.  I found the following SO post helpful at first:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4438601/bundler-incorrectly-trying-to-install-development-and-test-group-gems-in-pro\">bundler incorrectly trying to install &quot;development&quot; and &quot;test&quot; group gems in production</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So I executed <code>bundle install --without test development</code> on my local and then tried to manually copy .bundle/config from my directory to the network dir, but that didn't work. Bundler still tried to load the excluded gems.</p>\n\n<p>This is painful for us because we don't have admin privileges to install gems on these servers (i.e. we aren't allowed to ever run <code>bundle install</code> in any form).  Likewise, the admins do not want to be bothered with deploying our apps every 5 mins since this is an internal prototyping site and not an external production site.  They also don't want to run <code>bundle install</code> because they want tight control of which gems are deployed across all applications -- for example, some apps are still Rails2 based and don't use Bundler yet, so they may break if the wrong gem is installed.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to use Bundler in a passive/rsync way, or should we just redesign our environment to let developers run <code>bundle install</code> via capistrano or some such?</p>\n\n<p>Help?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1/18/2012: After investigating the reason for the :test and :development group errors some more, I <a href=\"http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#bundler_support\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovered</a> that Phusion Passenger actually executes <code>Bundle.setup()</code> before the Rails app gets a chance to in <code>boot.rb</code>.  Without any arguments, <code>setup()</code> checks all gem dependencies, which means if it doesn't find a gem on the server, it will blow up in Passenger before it even gets a chance to load Rails.</p>\n\n<p>This particular 'bug' can only happen if you deploy via rsync or copy instead of running <code>bundle install --without test:development</code> on the target server.  The majority of Rails3 apps are deployed with Capistrano, which does this step for you, and as such never encounter this particular edge case.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm afraid the only way to get 'groups' to work correctly in your gem file is to use <code>bundle install</code> as intended.

I get this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I remove the .name attribute, it just returns a pointer to the Chore object.</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling this has something to do with passing the User.all object to the view and then iterating over that. Just accessing a specific User object (e.g. User.find(1)) in the console, and then accessing user.chore.name works fine.</p>\n\n<pre><code>1.9.3-p194 :045 &gt; user = User.find(4)\n  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\" WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = ?

So, in this case, I get a pointer to the Chore object but no access to any of its attributes.</p>\n\n<p>I could certainly just add Chore as another column in my user table, but I may add to that model in the future + I just want to figure out how the has_one association works anyway. </p>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","ruby-on-rails-3.1","ruby-on-rails-3.2"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":12969435,"title":"Ruby delete_if multiple values - only first value being deleted","body":"<pre><code>words.delete_if do |x|\n  x == (\"a\"||\"for\"||\"to\"||\"and\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>words</code> is an array with many words.

Here is a link to the few files in question where I assume my problem lies:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/0fe5cf9093b21f4f632f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/0fe5cf9093b21f4f632f</a></p>\n\n<p>I apologize if the code is really bad/adds a few things that don't need to exist as I'm still trying to get used to how everything works as I go along. I want to have comments for each post that is made on my website -- and the logic I have is that users have many comments, and I suppose that the posts have many comments through the users. I do have that relationship added (though it doesn't seem to be doing anything in particular), and I feel as if all of my table references are correct (though I haven't added anything to users as I'm using devise and didn't feel like I needed to add anything as the post is a separate object itself).</p>\n\n<p>As of right now, I can show all of the comments in general, as in I am able to create and save them. I was also saving, at the very least, the user_id variable, so it can understand which account is making the comment. I'm not really sure where/when I should be passing in the post_id, so that's the biggest issue. Any way I've tried to do it in the posts_controller (since in theory I should be able to edit that attribute when the post page is loaded), I get an \"undefined method 'post_id'\" or \"no post_id column\" error, indicating that it doesn't exist, even though as far as I understand, I've defined it. The fact that the user_id is able to be saved, as mentioned before, further confuses me.</p>\n\n<p>If I show the attributes on a comment created in my show view, I get the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{\"id\"=>1, \"content\"=>\"text here\", \"posted\"=>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00, >\"user_id\"=>1, \"created_at\"=>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00, \"updated_at\"=>Sat, 03 Nov >2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no \"post_id\", although I did add it into the migration table for comments. Trying to pass the @post.id in the posts controller (to a show method's instance of a comment, as it would be available beneath a post) gives a mass assignment error.

The legacy application looks for a cookie that has a value containing a specific string of characters.  Unfortunately, the characters in the legacy cookie often contain slashes.  The problem I have is that when the Rails application writes the cookie it first does URL-encoding which causes the legacy app to break because the cookie values is incorrect.  </p>\n\n<p>I had this working in Rails 1.13.5 by editing the file <code>cookie_performance_fix.rb</code> (Path: <code>./actionpack-1.13.5/lib/action_controller/cgi_ext/cookie_performance_fix.rb</code>)<br />\nIn order to get this to work I changed the code as shown:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>def to_s\n  buf = \"\"\n  buf &lt;&lt; @name &lt;&lt; '='\n\n  if @value.kind_of?(String)\n    rails code. \n        #buf &lt;&lt; CGI::escape(@value)\n         buf &lt;&lt; @value\n  else\n        #buf &lt;&lt; @value.collect{|v| CGI::escape(v) }.join(\"&amp;\")\n  \tbuf &lt;&lt; @value.collect{|v| (v) }.join(\"&amp;\")\n\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This actually worked fine until I decided to upgrade Rails to version 2.3.2<br />\nIn Rails 2.3.2 the <code>cookie_performance_fix.rb</code> file no longer exists.

The cookie keeps getting URL-encoded in the new Rails 2.3.2.  I know that turning off URL-encoding is not the best idea, but I don't have much choice until the legacy application is retired.  I unfortunately do not have access to the legacy code to add support for URL-unencoding the cookie so I have to make sure the legacy cookie is written with the correct sequence including the slashes.  If anyone can tell me how to turn off URL-encoding in Rails 2.3.2 it would be greatly appreciated.<br />\nThanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","json","rabl"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13210433,"title":"Understanding APIs","body":"<p>I was reading through the RABL git <a href=\"https://github.com/nesquena/rabl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/nesquena/rabl</a> and I quickly came across this line.

It still sits there and runs the tests when there are changes, but I wondered if anyone knew why this would be, especially as, to my knowledge, I've set this project up exactly the same as my other projects (the Gemfiles are exactly the same).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, all the output messages are coming out with a timestamp and INFO preceding them.

To re-create, we followed the following steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Visit the users job applications index</li>\n<li>Click a button to the manage job posting page</li>\n<li>Click on a tab (using bettertabs gem)</li>\n<li>Click the browser's back button</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The previous steps would display:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function() {\n\n  $(\".job_applications\").html(\"&lt;li class=\\\"job_posting_application\\\"&gt;\\n\n    ...\n    ...\n    ...\n    ...\n  );\n\n}).call(this);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In some hit-or-miss cases, you wouldn't need to click on a tab prior to going back to the previous page, yet it would still render the raw javascript. At the end of the day, it seems the last rendered template is being cached, which is normal and expected on the browser's part, but leads into what I believe to be a larger problem.</p>\n\n<p>The Rails Guides state in the section on <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html\"><strong>Layouts and Rendering</strong></a>, specifically regarding MIME type of the template:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>By default, Rails will serve the results of a rendering operation with the MIME content-type of text/html (or application/json if you use the :json option, or application/xml for the :xml option.).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the Rails defaults, our controller's index action is expected to render our <code>index.html.slim</code> template. However, when making a non-remote call to that page (e.g., directly navigating to the page in the browser) while tailing the server logs, we notice that it actually renders <code>index.js.coffee</code>. Below is our controller action, and notice we are not explicitly responding to html or js formats, as we probably should considering the overlying features in this page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def index\n  @company_id, @division_id, @job_posting_id = params[:company_id], params[:division_id], params[:job_posting_id]\n\n  # API requests are made here to instantiate @job_posting, et al.,\n  # but are not shown for brevity\n\n  authorize! :manage, @job_posting\n\n  @survey = @job_posting.survey\n  @job_applications = @job_posting.job_applications(sort_column, sort_direction)\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Given this setup, however, <code>index.html.slim</code> <em>should</em> be rendered based on Rails defaults. When adding a <code>respond_to</code> block, it seems the caching is still in effect and the controller could care less about the presence of a <code>respond_to</code> block:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def index\n  ...\n  ...\n  respond_to do |format|\n    format.html\n    format.js\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even when explicitly, and albeit smelly, telling each format to render a different template, it seems the <code>js.coffee</code> template takes precedence over the <code>html.slim</code> template:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def index\n  ...\n  ...\n  respond_to do |format|\n    format.html { render template: \"users/job_posting_applications/index\" }\n    format.js { render template: \"users/job_posting_applications/ajax\" }\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above case, directly navigating to the page in the browser (in other words, not making a remote Ajax call), the server log would render <code>ajax.js.coffee</code>, even though the Rails default is html unless otherwise specified.</p>\n\n<p>All this being said, here are some other findings:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Started GET \"/users/companies/1/divisions/18/job_postings/349421/applications\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-10-03 19:55:26 -0400\nProcessing by Users::JobPostingApplicationsController#index as JSON\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(<strong><em>you can reference the entire request shown above <a href=\"http://pastie.org/4905407\">in this pastie</a></em></strong>)</p>\n\n<p>Why it's processing as JSON is beyond me, considering we are not serving any JSON on this request, and have no specifications in routing for a default format of <code>:json</code> for this route.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, when debugging the value of <code>request.format</code> within this action, it returns <code>application/json</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another scenario that presented is within another controller (<code>users/company_admin_metrics#index</code>) that contains only an <code>index.html.slim</code> template.  When navigating to this page, the server log shows that it rendered <code>users/company_admin_metrics/index.html.slim</code> within <code>layouts/users</code>. When I create a blank js.coffee template:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ touch app/views/users/company_admin_metrics/index.js.coffee\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and directly navigate to that index page, the server log shows that it rendered <code>users/company_admin_metrics/index.js.coffee</code>, which further exposes a potential issue somewhere regarding template rendering precedence.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone encountered a similar issue that may provide a potential fix for this?</p>\n\n<h2>Our stack</h2>\n\n<p>Below is a minute list of the basic players into this particular question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rails 3.2.6</li>\n<li>Coffee-Rails 3.2.1</li>\n<li>Bettertabs 1.2.6</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This request depends on requests to our job posting API through a client gem that parses JSON and returns a Ruby object, but these are not coupled with this particular app in such a way that would conflict and cause <em>this</em> app to have a content-type of <code>application/json</code> for such a request as described above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":1,"question_id":13207058,"title":"Theoretical: method_missing","body":"<p>i just start to learn rails and i can not understand that:</p>\n\n<p>In my Post controller i do not have method show (not described), but i put in my contrller that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  def method_missing(name, *args)\n    redirect_to posts_path\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i think if controller not find action show - he will call method_missing and after that redirect to 'index' method\nbut rails tries render view show.html.erb </p>\n\n<p>Why method missing does not catching? how i can use method_missing </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","pagination","rails-routing","kaminari"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":1,"question_id":13043825,"title":"Validate page number when using Kaminari","body":"<p>I am using Kaminari to handle pagination.

When a client issues a PUT request with the body:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"name\":\"updated product set\",\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything is great. In the background Rails will take that body, then transform it into:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"name\":\"updated product set\",\n  ...\n  \"model_name\" =&gt; { ... }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the hash \"model_name\" points to contains the attribute values it can automatically figure out from the input. All is well.</p>\n\n<p>When I try the same exact request from the testing environment, all is not well. If I create a hash that is exactly the same PUT body hash as above, but in rspec:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@update_json = {\n  \"id\":1,\n  \"name\":\"updated product set\",\n  ...\n}\nheader \"Accept\",\"application/json\"\nheader \"Content-type\",\"application/json\"\nput :update, @update_json\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Things do not work out at all.

For example, you can't get the system to respond with a 404 since Rails throws an Exception that would normally be caught by Rails network stack and turned into a 404 but which isn't with Rspec.

Warning: the following is not a question, rather explanation of what I came up with. My question is — do you have a better way to do this? Is there some common technique for this that I'm not familiar with? Seems like this is a trivial problem.</p>\n\n<p>So you have Task model. You can create tasks, complete them, destroy them. Then you have recurring tasks. It's just like regular task, but it has a recurrence rule attached to it. However, tasks can recur indefinitely — you can go a year ahead in the schedule, and you should see the task show up.</p>\n\n<p>So when a user creates a recurring task, you don't want to build thousands of tasks for hundred years into the future, and save them to database, right? So I started thinking — how do you create them?</p>\n\n<p>One way would be to create them as you view your schedule. So, when the user is moving a month ahead, any recurring tasks will be created. Of course that means that you can't simply work with database records of tasks any longer. Every SELECT operation on tasks you ever do has to be in the context of a particular date range, in order to trigger recurring tasks in that date range to persist. This is a maintenance and performance burden, but doable.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, but how about the original task? Every recurrent task gets associated with the recurrence rule that created it, and every recurrence rule needs to know the original task that started the recurrence. The latter is important, because you need to clone the original task into new dates as the user browses their schedule. I guess doable too.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens if the original task is updated? It means that now as we browse the schedule, we will be creating recurring tasks cloned off of the modified task. That's undesirable. All the implicitly persisted recurring tasks should show up the way the original task looked like when recurrence was added. So we need to store a copy of the original task separately, and clone from that, in order for recurrence to work.</p>\n\n<p>However, when the user navigates the tasks in the schedule, how do we know if at a particular point a new recurrence task needs to be created? We ask recurrence rule: \"hey, should I persist a task for this day?\" and it says yes or no. If there is already a task for this recurrence for this day, we don't create one. All nice, except a user shall also be able to simply delete one of the recurring tasks that has been automatically persisted. In that case following our logic, the system will re-create the task that has been deleted. Not good. So it means we need to keep storing the task, but mark it as deleted task for this recurrence. Meh.</p>\n\n<p>As I said in the beginning, I want to know if somebody else tackled this problem and can provide architectural advice here. Does it have to be this messy? Is there anything more elegant I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since this question is hard to answer perfectly, I will approve the most helpful insight into design/architecture, which has the best helpfulness/trade-offs ratio for this type of problem. It does not have to encompass all the details.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","railstutorial.org"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":3,"question_id":13204965,"title":"Rspec expected link_to not finding anything","body":"<p>![enter image description here][1]I have been reading up on the RoR tutorial book by Michael Hartl and I'm stuck with 7 fails on Rspec.

Firstly, here's the code for application controller to retrieve the current cart:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  private\n  def current_cart \n    Checkout::Cart.find(session[:cart_id])\n  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound \n    cart = Checkout::Cart.create \n    session[:cart_id] = cart.id\n    cart\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the code for my line item controller</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>class Checkout::LineItemsController &lt; ApplicationController</p>\n  \n  <p># POST /checkout/line_items   # POST /checkout/line_items.json   def\n  create</p>\n\n<pre><code>@cart = current_cart\nproduct = Catalog::Product.find(params[:product_id])\napparel_event_log.info (product.to_json)\n\n\n@checkout_line_item = @cart.line_items.find_or_initialize_by_sku_id(product.part_number)\nnew_quantity = @checkout_line_item.quantity || 0\n@checkout_line_item.quantity = new_quantity+1\n@checkout_line_item.line_item_description = product.name\n@checkout_line_item.image = product.primary_image\n\nrespond_to do |format|\n  if @checkout_line_item.save\n    format.html { redirect_to @checkout_line_item.cart, notice: 'Line item was successfully created.' }\n    format.json { render json: @checkout_line_item, status: :created, location: @checkout_line_item }\n  else\n    format.html { render action: \"new\" }\n    format.json { render json: @checkout_line_item.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }\n  end\nend   end\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p># DELETE /checkout/line_items/1   # DELETE\n  /checkout/line_items/1.json   def destroy\n      Checkout::LineItem.delete(params[:id])</p>\n\n<pre><code>respond_to do |format|\n  format.html { redirect_to current_cart, notice: 'Line item removed.' }\n  format.json { head :no_content }\nend   end end\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and also the code for the line items model</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Checkout::LineItem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  before_save :default_values\n\n  attr_accessible :customer_update_date, :inventory_status, :line_item_color, :line_item_description, :line_item_size, :line_item_tagline, :line_item_total, :image, :quantity, :sku_id, :style_id, :tax, :tax_code, :timestamps, :unit_price, :cart, :product\n  belongs_to :cart\n  belongs_to :product, :class_name =&gt; 'Catalog::Product'\n  has_one :image, :class_name =&gt; 'Assets::Medium'\n\n  def default_values\n     Rails.logger.debug { \"Entering default values\" }\n     self.quantity ||= 0\n   end\n\nend\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","validation","email"],"answer_count":10,"favorite_count":21,"up_vote_count":47,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17830,"score":47,"question_id":1156601,"title":"What's the state of the art in email validation for Rails?","body":"<p>What are you using to validate users' email addresses, and why?</p>\n\n<p>I had been using <a href=\"http://github.com/Empact/validates%5Femail%5Fveracity%5Fof/tree/master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>validates_email_veracity_of</code></a> which actually queries the MX servers.

I need to create separate tables for each of these projects. But you don't know how many project there'll be. And I need to dynamically create these tables in my code. How to achieve that in my code? Do I use ActiveRecord to achieve that or any other methods?</p>\n\n<p>Codes like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list = maintain_a_dir_list()\n\nDir.entries( dir ).each { |e|\n  if e is not in list\n    create_a_table_after_e_name\n  end\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Here's I will explain why I want to create such tables :</strong></p>\n\n<p>The directory name and its sub folder name I methioned above is unreal. So let's told this story all over again. </p>\n\n<p>I am a load tester. I do load test for one of our company's projects. Let's say the project's name is <code>Project_A</code>. <code>Project_A</code> has many versions, like 1.0, 2.0 and so on. So in every release I'll do many rounds of load test to ensure the product's quality.</p>\n\n<p>So the relationship between project, verson and loadtest report is simple : project contains many versions. And each version contains many loadtest reports which executed in different days. </p>\n\n<p>The information in loadtest report is as following :</p>\n\n<p>transaction name | min time | average response time | max time</p>\n\n<p>transaction_01 | 1.0s | 2.0s | 3.0s </p>\n\n<p>transaction_02 | 0.5s | 1.5s | 4.0s</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>To store the reports information in database, I create a table named <code>transactions_table</code>. The table is like this :</p>\n\n<p>report_name | transaction_name | min | average | max </p>\n\n<p>20121001_100users_4hours | transaction_01 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0</p>\n\n<p>20121001_100users_4hours | transaction_02 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>20121002_100users_2hours | transaction_01 | 1.5 | 2.1 | 2.5</p>\n\n<p>20121002_100users_2hours | transaction_02 | 1.1 | 2.1 | 2.7</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Then I want to get the version information involved. So I create another table named <code>reports_table</code>. The table is like this :</p>\n\n<p>version | report_name</p>\n\n<p>project_a_1.0 | 20121001_100users_4hours</p>\n\n<p>project_a_1.0 | 20121002_100users_2hours</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>project_a_2.0 | 20121101_50users_1hours</p>\n\n<p>project_a_2.0 | 20121102_50users_2hours</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>And ofcourse there's more than one project in my company. There'll be <code>Project_B</code>, <code>Project_C</code> and <code>D</code>... So again comes the version table consist of the Project name and its versions.</p>\n\n<p>It's the first time I design the relationship of DB tables. So I don't know whether the way i organize table is right. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I simply think I can put all the transaction data--no matter which project or version it belongs--in <code>transactions_table</code>. Then I realize the report name from different projects or versions may be the same. Then it cannot seperate <code>transactions_table</code> using <code>select * from transactions_table where report_name = \"xxxx\"</code>. And the <code>transactions_table</code>'s size will increase more rapidly than the other two tables. </p>\n\n<p>So that's why I am considering to store the reports in different projects to different table.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby-on-rails-3","forms","amazon-s3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":190,"score":0,"question_id":11725002,"title":"Rails 3: How to configure Zencoder to work with Amazon S3?","body":"<p>I'm following this tutorial to integrate Zencoder in my Rails 3 app: <a href=\"http://www.nickdesteffen.com/blog/video-encoding-with-uploadify-carrierwave-and-zencoder\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nickdesteffen.com/blog/video-encoding-with-uploadify-carrierwave-and-zencoder</a></p>\n\n<p>The tutorial uses Rackspace for storage, but I'd like to adapt the code so that I can use Amazon S3 for storage instead.

After this, we could remove the useless SQL query.</p>\n\n<p>As this seems very simple, and useful, I'm wondering why popular Authentication plugins such as the Devise gem (for Rails or Sinatra) don't seems to work this way.</p>\n\n<p>Is they a best way to do so?

Probably also things like em dashes and the elipses character.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if there's routine I can run on the incoming data to overcome this problem.</p>\n\n<p>It's OK if the quotes get turned into straight quotes, elipses get turned into three periods, etc.</p>\n\n<p>It could even be a utility that runs on the system level that I could call from my app with </p>\n\n<pre><code>processed_data = `system_command #{params[:incoming_data]}`\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":13184406,"title":"Can 'rake db:seed' tell you which record it is choking on?","body":"<p>When seeding data, I sometimes get an error like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Owner(#70279918514200) expected, got String(#70279913263500)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would it be possible for Rake to tell me what record it is choking on?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>This has a little more info on what I'm looking for:</p>\n\n<p>I have a flat file which indicates the data I need.

I've seen the parameter passed different ways in different documentation.  It sometimes gets passed as a symbol, sometimes as an instance variable, and sometimes as a local variable. </p>\n\n<p>I'm confused about how the different parameter styles get expanded to return urls.  I know that following REST conventions should create a url constructed of a controller and action but am unsure when Rails needs a specific parameter style to construct that url.  Please help me understand the use cases for passing the ActiveRecord object as a symbol, an instance variable, or a local variable.  Are there different requirements based on the method call?  Or are there underlying differences in url construction?  </p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<p>From the API docs:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>link_to \"Profile\", @profile  \nredirect_to post  \n&lt;%= url_for(@workshop) %&gt;  \n&lt;%= form_for :person do |f| %&gt; (this is described as the “generic #form_for”)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the Ruby on Rails Guides:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%= link_to 'New book', new_book_path %&gt;  \nredirect_to(@book)  \nform_for(@article)  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the Rails 3 Way:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>'link_to' \"Help\", help_widgets_path, :popup =&gt; 1  \nredirect_to post  \nurl_for(timesheets_path)  \nform_for offer do |f|  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: Upon further research, it seems that form_for is able to accept a local variable in the case where the calling view template passes a :locals hash as a parameter.  The keys are the locals that can be used in the partial and the values are the instance variables from the template. Is that the correct understanding?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ubuntu","deployment","capistrano"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13130918,"title":"Сapistrano: cannot access `~/releases/' : No such file or directory","body":"<p>After I did <code>bundle update</code> both on my local machine and server, I am not able to deploy anymore.

If there is not a gem version configuration that meets the recommended dependencies, is there a least-bad approach to pursue?</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","resources"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":284,"score":3,"question_id":4439425,"title":"In Ruby on Rails, what does \"resource\" mean?","body":"<p>I see the word <code>resource</code> in many different places like: <strong>Resource Routing</strong>, <strong>Resourceful Controller</strong>, and <strong>resources: photos</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>What does <code>resource</code> actually mean?</p>\n\n<p>One more question: What does <strong>RESTful route</strong> mean?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","caching","acts-as-taggable-on"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":571,"score":2,"question_id":3946783,"title":"How to cache tags with acts_as_taggable_on?","body":"<p>I have model with tag context:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_taggable_on :categories\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm trying to initialize tags caching:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class AddCachedCategoryListToProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    add_column :products,  :cached_category_list, :string\n    Product.reset_column_information\n    products = Product.all\n    products.each { |p| p.save_cached_tag_list }\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But <code>cached_category_list</code> does not initializing.
