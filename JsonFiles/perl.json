What is important here is the number after \"Sample\" and the letter+number after \"<em>Name</em>\" - the rest is disposable. If i get rid of the non-important parts, the filename reduces to the same pattern as the \"clean\" filenames (2E01.txt, 2E02.txt, ..., 12E01.txt). I've managed to rename the files with the following expression (came up with this one myself, don't know if is very elegant but works fine):</p>\n\n<pre><code>rename -v 's/Sample([0-9]+)_Name_([A-Z][0-9]+).*/$1$2\\.txt/' *.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the second part, is adding a leading zero for filenames with just one digit, such as 1E01.txt turns into 01E01.txt.

The keys in the \"English\" index are mostly ASCII but occasionally contain Unicode (UTF-8) characters. The keys in the \"Chinese\" index are all UTF-8 (Simplified Chinese).

For the most part this Just Works™. With the Chinese characters, I had some trouble where the C# System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture could vary depending on the user-specified locale (for example, on a \"zh-CN\" device set up for a Chinese user), but I got past that by locking the CurrentCulture to \"en-GB\" (same as my build machine) for the duration of the search.</p>\n\n<p>So for a while it seemed that Perl's sort() and C#'s String.Compare() would play nicely together.</p>\n\n<p>However, recently my data source was updated so I rebuilt the indexes. Now in some cases the lookup against the English index fails (Chinese still works).

It is because perl is generating the output file in unix format which has a control ^M character at the end of each line. so to convert the unix format file to linux format file, i need to use a command call \"unix2dos\" which is not available in windows. I can download the utility and put in system32 but my admin doesnt allow it, he wants me to do everything in Perl. There are many of scripts that fail and the issue is same. This is a Production Issue we had been facing from past 8-9 months. This error came out while we were migrating and testing all the scripts from old server to a new one due to Company’s Hardware Recycle Policy.

I am referring to code published directly in this book in the Section titled \"Adding Our First Tests\".</p>\n\n<p>For some background, in this chapter, a sample <code>Animal</code> class is created in a module with the same name.  This class has a simple <code>speak</code> method which looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sub speak {\n    my $class = shift;\n    print \"a $class goes \", $class-&gt;sound, \"!\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>sound</code> method is a simple string returned for an particular Animal, so for example, a Horse's <code>sound</code> method will be simply <code>sub sound { \"neigh\" }</code> and it's <code>speak</code> method should output the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A Horse goes neigh!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem I'm running into is the following:  in the testing code I've created at ./Animal/t/Animal.t , I am instructed to use bare blocks and <code>Test::More::is</code> to test that the <code>speak</code> method is working.  The code looks like this in the test file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[test code snip]\n{\n    package Foofle;\n    use parent qw(Animal);\n\n    sub sound { 'foof' }\n    is( Foofle-&gt;speak, \n        \"A Foofle goes foof!\\n\", \n        \"An Animal subclass does the right thing\"\n    );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The test fails.  I ran all the Build commands, but when running \"Build test\", I get this failure for the Animal test:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Undefined subroutine &amp;Foofle::is called at t/Animal.t line 28.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I try to explicitly use <code>Test::More::is</code> instead of just plain <code>is</code>, the test still fails with the following message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#   Failed test 'An Animal subclass does the right thing'\n#   at t/Animal.t line 28.\n#          got: '1'\n#     expected: 'A Foofle goes foof!\n# '\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My methods appear to be defined exactly as I explained.  I think the first error is a scope issue because of the bare blocks, but not 100% sure.  The second error I am unsure about, because if I were to create a <code>Foofle</code> class as a child of <code>Animal</code> and called <code>speak</code> on it, I would not get a 1 response, but rather the expected output.</p>\n\n<p>Would someone be able to help out on what I may be doing wrong?

So far i tried something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>my $x = ' some text I-LXIII iv more ';\n\nif (  $x =~  s/\\b(\n                    (\n                        (XC|XL|L?X{0,3}) # first group 10-90\n                    |\n                        (IX|IV|V?I{0,3}) # second group 1-9\n                    )+\n            )\n        \\b/&gt;$1&lt;/xgi ) { # mark every occurrence\n    say $x;\n}\n\n__END__\n &gt;&lt;some&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;text&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;&gt;I&lt;&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;&gt;LXIII&lt;&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;&gt;iv&lt;&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;more&gt;&lt; \n desired output:\n  some text &gt;I&lt;-&gt;LXIII&lt; &gt;iv&lt; more \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, this one captures word boundaries by themself too, because all groups are optional. How to get it done? How to make one of those 2 groups mandatory while there is no possible to tell which one is mandatory? Other approaches to catch romans are welcome too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","executable","www-mechanize"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":12965208,"title":"www::mechanize perl, executable","body":"<p>I read a question you asked about 5months ago on stackoverflow.com more precisly here it is:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10634444/using-wwwmechanize-to-navigate-forms-on-amazon-site\">Using WWW::Mechanize to navigate forms on Amazon site</a></p>\n\n<p>I am creating a script that enters a site and enters my credentials, to finally save the sites source code so I can parse the information.</p>\n\n<p>I have a problem, my script works totally fine when used as a .pl script or on eclipse.

In one of them, you have a hard-coded hash of last names to first names. The user inputs a last name and you output the first name -- relatively straightforward. The code is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nmy %first_name = (\n    Doe =&gt; 'John',\n    Johnson =&gt; 'Bob',\n    Pitt =&gt; 'Brad',\n);\n\nprint \"What is your last name?\\n\";\nchomp (my $last_name = &lt;STDIN&gt;);\nprint \"Your first name is $first_name{$last_name}.\\n\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, something strange happens. The <strong>\"What is your last name?\\n\"</strong> line is not displayed until I input something to the program (and press Enter), after which, the following is printed:</p>\n\n<pre><code>What is your last name?\nYour first name is .\nUse of uninitialized value within %first_name in concatenation (.) or string at     test.pl line 14, &lt;STDIN&gt; line 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I understand the notion of buffered output and all that, and, if I add <code>$| = 1</code> at the beginning of my program, it works. However, my expectation would be that even without that line, even though <code>print</code> statement strings might not print immediately, my input string will still be placed in the <code>$last_name</code> variable, which it is not. So, I have two questions regarding this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why is this happening? Is it an OS thing (I'm running on Windows)?</li>\n<li>Why is it that adding a <code>\\n</code> does not flush the output (as various sources say it does)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If I replace the last line that accesses the <code>%first_name</code> hash with a simple printing of the <code>$last_name</code> variable, then, even though the output is still \"delayed\", the variable has the correct value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note #2</strong>: Alternatively, if the code after printing the last name is replaced with this,</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (exists $first_name{$last_name}){ \n   print \"Your first name is $first_name{$last_name}.\\n\";\n}\n\nelse{\n    print \"Last name is not in hash.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then <code>$last_name</code> does get assigned the correct value from <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code>. I am not sure what to make of this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","ssl","amazon-web-services","lwp","amazon-ses"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3081,"score":1,"question_id":5639803,"title":"AWS SES certificate verify failed","body":"<p>I have set up SES successfully on one AWS instance.

It is not getting called at the point where we would have thought the object goes out of scope. And while we considered that maybe there was a dangling reference to it somewhere, it isn't being called at script exit, either. We've littered the class and the script with debugging <code>print</code> statements, and even made an explicit call to it in an <code>END</code> block just to verify that we hadn't somehow put it in the wrong namespace.

The installation is on our department server's local drive, which is also shared to the network.  All department users run Perl on their own PCs by pointing to this network-installed Perl.  This has worked for years, and isn't causing a problem, but it's a piece of info needed to understand the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The server in question is also our \"cron\" (Scheduled Task) server, handling a variety of automation tasks.  Suddenly last week, system calls in Perl scripts (on the server) started failing (details below).  At first, I suspected a corrupt Perl installation, but all of the client PCs can still run the same Perl scripts without any issues, leading me to think it's a server issue.  I've rebooted the server twice, and the problem is persistent, thus I need help!</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of the various way that system calls are failing, boiled down to Perl one-liners:</p>\n\n<pre><code>% perl -e \"system('dir')\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That should print a \"dir\" listing, but instead it opens a sub-shell.  If I type \"exit\", I can exit the sub-shell, and I'm back in the original shell (confirmed by examining the shell history using the UP arrow key).</p>\n\n<pre><code>% perl -e \"print `dir`\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This actually hangs.  Nothing happens at all.  If I Ctrl-C to kill the process, I get the message \"Terminating on signal SIGINT(2)\" and the DOS prompt comes back.  But, any future commands in the DOS prompt (even just hitting ENTER) cause the error \"The process tried to write to a nonexistent pipe.\".  You have to exit the DOS prompt as it's effectively useless.</p>\n\n<p>Last example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>% perl -e \"system('Z:/Scripts/rebuild.pl')\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>'ebuild.pl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, Perl switches the forward-slashes (/) to DOS/Windows back-slashes (), which it has done just fine for years.  But, Perl is interpreting the \"\\r\" at the beginning of the \"rebuild.pl\" filename as a carriage-return (I think) and looking for the remaining \"ebuild.pl\".

I am currently working with the VMWare SDK for Perl and I am stuck on my uploading function. What I would like to do, is generate a unique identifier for each VMDKs (e.g. hard-disks I add to a VM). Basically, the user provides that the hard-disk should have as a parameter of the script.</p>\n\n<p>However, we have a problem if the user choses a name which is already taken. I thought about many solutions, like adding a timestamp (which would be unique), but I would like something more elegant. So, let us consider :</p>\n\n<p><strong>@vmdks</strong> : List all the hard-disks which are already on the VM</p>\n\n<p><strong>$filename</strong> : Name that the user wants to give to the VMDK, once it is on the VM</p>\n\n<p><strong>$target</strong> : Name that the hard-disk will ACTUALLY have.</p>\n\n<p>I would like something like filename-00X, where X is the occurence. So for example, if someone tries to add a hard-disk called \"FOO\", while one already exists, it will be renamed into \"FOO-001\". Note that the user can only enter a disk name with Alphanumerical characters, so he cannot name a hard-disk \"FOO-001\", which avoids conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>So since I do not know Perl very much, I decided to write it in pseudo-code, hope you do not mind : </p>\n\n<pre><code>IF $filename IS IN @vmdks\n   # So here we have a conflict\n\n   IF $filename-X IS IN @vmdks  \n      # X should be a 3-digit number, like 001, 002, 666, etc.\n      INDEX := X\n      INDEX++\n      $target = $filename-INDEX\n   ELSE\n      $target = $filename-001\n   ENDIF\nELSE\n   $target = $filename \nENDIF\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I guess I can easily do the first condition by something like : </p>\n\n<pre><code>if(grep{$_ eq $filename} @vmdks) ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the second one...

Here's exactly what our teacher assigned:</p>\n\n<p>\"You should write a script (you may name you script whatever you deem appropriate) that accepts 3 filenames as arguments.  The first filename corresponds to the program source code written in C++.  The second filename corresponds to an input file that is to be used by the C++ program listed as the first filename.  The third filename corresponds to a text file that contains the expected, correct output for the program in question.  A directory path may be provided with any of the filenames.</p>\n\n<p>If the program doesn’t require an input file, the second parameter on the command line should be the filename \"/dev/null\".</p>\n\n<p>All of the files - the program source, the input file, and expected output file - should be copied to a scratch test directory before any of them are used by the script so that there is little chance that the originals will be modified by the test procedure.  If the scratch directory doesn’t exist, your script should create one as a subdirectory of the current working directory.</p>\n\n<p>Your script should then compile and link the scratch copy of the source using the GNU g++ compiler.  The script should then run the program – saving the output to a temporary file stored in the scratch test directory.</p>\n\n<p>After running the program, your script should then use the UNIX command diff to compare the actual output generated in the previous step with the expected output file and report either that the output conforms to specifications or report any differences as reported by the diff program.</p>\n\n<p>After completion, your script should remove all of the temporary copies and scratch files.  Do not remove the original program, the original input file, the original expected output file, or the scratch directory itself.\"</p>\n\n<p>I have this so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\nuse strict;\n\nmy ($line, $program, $input, $output);\n\nprint \"Give the program, input, and standart output for testing. \";\n\n$line = &lt;&gt;;\nchomp $line;\n\n($program, $input, $output) = split/\\s+/, $line; # split/\\s+/ is to separate spaces from the input\n\nmy($o_test) = $output + \"_test\";\n\nprint \"$program \";\nprint \"$input \";\nprint \"$output \";\n\nsystem(\"mkdir test_scratch\") == 0\nor die \"failed to create test_scratch. exiting....\"\n\nsystem(\"cp $program, /test_scratch/\"); # error\nsystem(\"cp $input, /test_scratch/\");\nsystem(\"cp $output, /test_scratch/\");\n\nsystem(\"cd test_scratch\");\n\nsystem(\"g++ $program\");\nsystem(\"chmod +x a.out\");\n\nsystem(\"./a.out &lt; $input &gt; $o_test\");\n\nmy($DIFF) = system(\"diff $output $o_test\") # error\n\nif[ $DIFF != \"\"]\n    print (\"Output conforms to specifications.\"); # error\nthen\n    print (\"$DIFF\");\nsystem(\"cd ..\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm getting errors at the # in code.

Typically if I ever needed to do that I'd append the <code>DEFAULT</code>s to the string directly and use sprintf and <code>$dbh-&gt;quote()</code> only for the non <code>DEFAULT</code> values.</p>\n\n<h1>UPDATE:</h1>\n\n<p>Worked out the misunderstanding in a quick chat. User <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/589924/ikegami\">ikegami</a> suggested that instead of building the query string myself without placeholders, that I just intermingle VALUES and placeholders such as: </p>\n\n<p><code>$queryString .= '(DEFAULT,?,?),(DEFAULT,DEFAULT,DEFAULT)';</code> </p>\n\n<p>Some of the reasoning behind my first asking of this question on SO was because I was somewhat against this intermingling due to my thought that it made the code less readable, though after being assured that sql 'DEFAULT' couldn't be in a placeholder bind value, this was the method I had begun implementing. </p>\n\n<p>Using placeholders where possible does seem to be the more accepted method of building queries, and if you want an SQL <code>DEFAULT</code> you just need to include it in the same query building as the placeholders. This does not apply to <code>NULL</code> values, as those CAN be inserted with placeholders and a bind value of <code>undef</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Update 2:</h3>\n\n<p>The reasoning I asked about performance, the 'acceptance' of building your own query with quote() vs building with placeholders, and why I've gone with a solution that involves using all columns for the SQL <code>INSERT INTO tblname (cols)</code> is because I have roughly 2-4 million rows a day going into a terrible db server, and my code is running on an equally terrible server. With my requirements of needing <code>DEFAULT</code> sql values, and these terrible performance constraints, I've chosen a solution for now. </p>\n\n<p>For future devs who stumble upon this - take a look at @emazep's solution of using SQL::Abstract, or if for some reason you need to build your own, you might consider either using @Schwern's subroutine solution or possibly incorporating some of @ikegami's answer into it as these are all great answers as to the 'Current state of affairs' regarding the usage of DBI and building dynamic queries.</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","hash","reference"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":1,"question_id":12754414,"title":"Perl modifying hash in subroutine - global symbol requires explicit package name","body":"<p>Having some trouble adding some keys to a hash, i.e. modifying in a subroutine.

To save a bit of time, I work on each photo in its own thread, and use a semaphore to limit the number of threads working simultaneously. Originally I allowed every thread to run at once, but the script would quickly allocate 3.5 GB for all the photos (I only have 2GB available), and the script would run 5x slower than normal because of all the swapping to disk.</p>\n\n<p>The working, semaphore version code looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>use threads;\nuse Thread::Semaphore;\nuse Image::Magick;\n\nmy $s = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new(4);\nforeach ( @photos ) {\n    threads-&gt;create( \\&amp;launch_thread, $s );\n}\nforeach my $thr ( reverse threads-&gt;list() ) {\n    $thr-&gt;join();\n}\n\nsub launch_thread {\n    my $s = shift;\n    $s-&gt;down();\n    my $image = Image::Magick-&gt;new();\n\n    # do memory-heavy work here\n\n    $s-&gt;up();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This quickly allocates 500MB, and runs quite nicely without ever requiring more. (The threads are joined in reverse order to make a point.) </p>\n\n<p>I wondered if there might be overhead from launching 80 threads simultaneously and blocking most of them, so I altered my script to block the main thread:</p>\n\n<pre><code>my $s = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new(4);\nforeach ( @photos ) {\n    $s-&gt;down();\n    threads-&gt;create( \\&amp;launch_thread, $s );\n}\nforeach my $thr ( threads-&gt;list() ) {\n    $thr-&gt;join();\n}\n\nsub launch_thread {\n    my $s = shift;\n    my $image = Image::Magick-&gt;new();\n\n    # do memory-heavy work here\n\n    $s-&gt;up();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This version starts fine, but gradually accumulates the 3.5GB of space the original version used. It's faster than running all threads at once, but still quite a bit slower than blocking threads.</p>\n\n<p>My first guess was that the memory used by a thread isn't freed until join() is called on it, and as it's the main thread that blocks, no threads are freed until they've all been allocated. However, in the first, working version, the threads pass the guard in a more-or-less random order, but join in reverse order. If my guess is correct, then, many more than the four running threads should be waiting to be join()ed at any time, and this version should be slower as well.</p>\n\n<p>So why are these two versions so different?</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","openid","google-openid","dancer"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":4,"question_id":12609076,"title":"How do I properly implement Net::OpenID::Consumer for Google logins and request the user's email?","body":"<p>I've been able to use Net::OpenID::Consumer with success, but when I started requesting the user's email address Google now prompts the user to authorize the sharing of their email address.

You could also manipulate the screen byte data, and you wouldn't have to hand off program control to any event handler. This ridiculously rudimentary functionality seems to be missing today from every language and every library.</p>\n\n<p>So I wrote a small library to do this in C using the XWindows API: HGR(x,y) puts up an XWindow, HCOLOR(i) sets the color, and HPLOT(i,j) plots a point, plus you extract the window's bitmap and can modify it and display the modified thing. This was not straightforward and I don't want to go through it again.</p>\n\n<p>I am using Perl for some things now, and I need such a tool for Perl, something where you can call a subroutine that preferrably returns without spawning a new thread, having output a window, where you can add graphical stuff to the window, and query the events when your program feels like it. This is the functionality of 1980s BASIC, so it shouldn't be hard. But the tools I saw didn't do it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GD: As far as I could see, this makes graphics files, not graphics windows. It seems you need to pipe it to another program.</li>\n<li>Gtk2: I have to fork out a separate thread to catch the events, otherwise it won't display the window. I don't want to fork anything, and I mostly don't care about any events, not unless I specifically ask to see the stuff piled up in the queue later.</li>\n<li>Qt: Here you are also expected to hand off control to the event handler, no handing off, no display. In the C++ version, I could get Qt to display and draw without a handoff.</li>\n<li>PerlTk: Again with the stupid handoff.</li>\n<li>OpenGL: Here, I don't know how to catch XWindows events, like a keypress, when I feel like looking at what happened.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to put up an XWindow from a running app, without forking out a GUI app process, where you can draw primitive things in the window like points and lines, and where you can query your windows' events on your own schedule?

I've already (so-as) chewed the basic documentation, and my first Moose and roles are already working, but I'm miles away from understanding how Moose actually works.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1: Is it absolutely necessary to understand how Moose works to write \"pretty good\" programs?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I don't quite understand the old object system. Something I vaguely remember reading is that it's actually a reference to a data structure, but I never explored deeper. It was sufficient for me to know how and when I needed to use <code>bless</code>, <code>autoload</code> etc. and things simply worked. Maybe some of my old modules can be written more effectively. But for me, they work and work well.</p>\n\n<p>Is this similar to Moose? Or does someone writing \"enough-good\" programs with Moose need to understand how it works \"inside\"?</p>\n\n<p>The question arises for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<p>In the METACPAN are dozens of modules that help write Moose objects even more easier and simpler.</p>\n\n<p>Examples at random:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::StrictConstructor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::StrictConstructor</a> (ok, easy to understand)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::HasDefaults\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::HasDefaults</a> (ok, easy)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/Method::Signatures::Simple\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/Method::Signatures::Simple</a> (bump! haven't idea what are the signatures, and this Module is the \"easy\" one.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AlwaysCoerce\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AlwaysCoerce</a> /hmm.... :(/</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::LazyRequire\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::LazyRequire</a> /hmm... :(/</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AbstractMethod\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AbstractMethod</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AttributeShortcuts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AttributeShortcuts</a> (Shorthand for common attribute options - so probably it is a helper - but, is it really useful to learn?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and many-many more (don't want cite here another 10-20 modules)</p>\n\n<p>And now the main question:</p>\n\n<p>Are there any good books with the instructions, examples and recommendations (good practices) for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>what</strong> from the above listed <strong>modules are recommended to use routinely from the start</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The above modules were surely not developed only because the author just hasn't what to do. Certainly they are useful and helpful. But learning (read: trying to understand) tens of many different modules (especially those who play with Moose internals) is an extremely long process. On the other hand, if they are not used, my programs will be unnecessarily complicated, and I will be dealing with things already resolved.</p>\n\n<p>Moose should be (and probably is) a revolutionary system. Only I'm starting getting lost.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just found <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/module/Reindeer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reindeer</a>. Probably this module is a partial answer to the question:\n<strong>what modules are useful to use from the start (or most of time)</strong></p>\n\n<p>PS: I'm not sure than this question is ok for SO. If not, please move it to somewhere or close it. I asked it here because the SO-perl community is a really helpful place, and I don't know how to continue to learn Moose.</p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","file-download","www-mechanize","lwp"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":90,"score":0,"question_id":12473800,"title":"Downloading several files froma website with Perl","body":"<p>I began to mess around with the Web in Perl.

Since there aren't any specific details I think that the above code works to at least correctly answer the question.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I wonder how small a program could possibly written for this? I can understand if no one wants to post code because they think I will use it for the assignment, but I am more or less looking for suggestions and techniques that could help me write the shortest program possible.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I am quite sure by shortest he is referring to actual code length. He did mention that scripting languages were the way to go so I doubt he is considering something like the overhead involved with an interpreter. This also means that he does not care which language is used.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for looking!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions! I had been reading questions here for quite a while, hopefully in the future I can contribute more. Also, some of the suggestions I trimmed my Perl code down to 55 bytes.

I also played around with <code>use parent qw(-norequire Object)</code>, <code>Module::Find</code> and some other <code>@INC</code> modifications in various combinations, to make it short: It didn't work.

Our task is to create an mp3 sharing site that allows users to create accounts, log in, share mp3's.  Statistics must be shown of current users, mp3's available, etc. All actions must be written to a log file.  Our code must be secure.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I have implemented each of these actions separately as their own CGI scripts.  For instance, I have a script that draws the login form, the registration form, a script that allows for mp3 uploads, and another that does the mp3 serving.  I've also created a module that posts relevant information to a log file whenever I call an instance of it.  However, each script is individual, with the exception of the Login screen, which draws a form and then posts to a login.cgi.  The account generation works the same.  But, for the most part, each acts on its own.</p>\n\n<p>My question:\n  How do I link this together so that no action is allowed unless the user is logged in?  I assume that I should use the login script (the one that receives the post action) to drive everything, but how do I do it?  I'm really at a loss here.  I would like to have a user log in, a homepage is drawn with options (add mp3, listen mp3, show staistics, etc.)  Is it best that I draw some sort of form and with actions set to the different scripts?  How do I handle the return from these scripts?  Would cookies help in some way?</p>\n\n<p>Other relevant information:\n  I've done most of my work so far in CGI.pm using the ovid tutorial found on this site and Lincoln Stein's book.</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","perl"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3293,"score":7,"question_id":386325,"title":"Where can I find a collection regular expression exercises for Perl?","body":"<p>I learned a lot of Perl RegEx syntax rules, but probably the only way to actually be able to write them is to do a bunch of 'RegEx' related exercises.</p>\n\n<p>I looked over the other \"Learn RegEx\" threads on StackOverflow, but haven't found anything similar.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any collection of such exercises?

File locking, progress monitoring and result propagation happen in an Oracle database which all (sub-)processes access at various times using an application-specific module which encapsulates DBI.</p>\n\n<p>This worked well at first, but now with higher volumes of input data, the number of database sessions (one per child, and they can be very short-lived) constantly being opened and closed is becoming an issue. I now want to centralise database access so that there are only one or few fixed database sessions which handle all database access for all the (sub-)processes. The presence of the database abstraction module should make the changes easy because the function calls in the worker instances can stay the same. My problem is that I cannot think of a suitable way to enhance said module in order to establish communication between all the processes and the database connector(s).</p>\n\n<p>I thought of message queueing, but couldn't come up with a way of connecting a large herd of requestors with one or few database connectors in a way so that bidirectional communication is possible (for collecting the query result).<br />\nAn asynchronous approach could help here in that all requests are written to the same queue and the database connector servicing the request will \"call back\" to submit the result. But my mind fails me in generating an image clear enough so that I can paint into code.<br />\nThreading instead of forking might have given me an easier start, but this would now require massive changes to the code base that I'm not prepared to do to a live system.  </p>\n\n<p>The more I think of it, the more the base idea looks like a pre-forked web server to me only that it doesn't serve web pages but database queries.

Is that any way to find the full path of the file by using perl? </p>\n"},{"tags":["perl","networking","network-programming","workaround"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":120,"score":4,"question_id":12277256,"title":"Perl workaround for EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)?","body":"<p>I just discovered a network failure which had caused an \"EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)\" infinite loop within <code>LWP::UserAgent</code> (regardless of which module is used).
