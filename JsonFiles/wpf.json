I am trying to create an editable datagrid in a WPF app using a subset gathered from a LINQ query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpEvents = from d in ThisData.Events.Local\n                   where d.StartDate.Value.Date &lt;= DateTime.Now.Date &amp;&amp;\n                   (d.EndDate.HasValue == false || d.EndDate.Value.Date &gt;= DateTime.Now.Date)\n                   select d;\nRangeEventGrid.ItemsSource = LookUpEvents;\nRangeEventGrid.Items.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This query works, and the datagrid is populated however I am unable to edit the datagrid, when trying to this exception is thrown:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"'EditItem' is not allowed for this view.\"\n   at System.Windows.Controls.ItemCollection.System.ComponentModel.IEditableCollectionView.EditItem(Object item)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.EditRowItem(Object rowItem)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When loading the full dataset using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ThisData.Events.Load();\nFullEventGrid.ItemsSource = ThisData.Events.Local;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works fine and the data is editable. The XAML used is identical (I have also tried swapping the bound datagrids and the full result remains editable and the query throws the exception still) and the only difference between these is the query. When I try to change the query I end up with a new exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The specified type member 'Date' is not supported in LINQ to Entities. Only initializers, entity members, and entity navigation properties are supported.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The query used for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpEvents = from d in ThisData.Events\n                   where d.StartDate.Value.Date &lt;= DateTime.Now.Date &amp;&amp;\n                   (d.EndDate.HasValue == false || d.EndDate.Value.Date &gt;= DateTime.Now.Date)\n                   select d;\nLookUpEvents.Load(); //Exception thrown here.\nRangeEventGrid.ItemsSource = LookUpEvents;\nRangeEventGrid.Items.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The really weird thing about that exception (weird to me at least) is that I use DateTime comparison in other queries that do not throw any exceptions, for example this query in another place works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpSessions = from d in ThisData.Sessions\n                     where d.EndTime.Hour &gt;= (DateTime.Now.Hour - 1) &amp;&amp; d.StartTime.Hour &lt;= (DateTime.Now.Hour + 2)\n                     &amp;&amp; d.Event.IsActive == true\n                     orderby d.StartTime.Hour, d.StartTime.Minute\n                     select d;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it not possible to bind a LINQ query result to a DataGrid to be editable? That seems like it'd be a huge oversight if that's the case. I feel like it's much more likely I'm just missing something basic since LINQ, WPF and EF are all brand new to me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","xaml","exception","gis"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12,"score":1,"question_id":13298482,"title":"Gerneral Transform InvalidOperation Exception was unhandled by user code","body":"<p>I have ran into a problem that I am completely clueless about.

To implement the the MVVM pattern I have a logic layer of classes which encapsulate the data tree. Therefore the logic also is arranged in a tree.

Therefore one way would be cloning. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach would be to implement the complete data backend to be immutable.

Therefore we defined classes like \"chassis, sequence, card, channel, step\".

Of course each class has some more properties but those are easy to handle. My Problem now is that List is a mutable object. I can call List.Add() and it changed. Ok there is a ReadOnlyList but I'm not sure if it implements the immutability the right way. Right as in copy by value not reference and not just blocking to write to it by blocking the set methods. \nThe next problem is that the amount of sequences and step can vary. For this reason I need an atomic exchange of list elements. \nAt the moment I don't have any more code as I'm still thinking if this way would help me and if it is possible at all to implement it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","listbox"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":269,"score":1,"question_id":11363203,"title":"How to get a dynamic ListBox ItemTemplate to stretch horizontally the full width of the ListBox?","body":"<p>I have a normal listbox with a custom template to show the items.

Everything works fine on my local machine but when deployed I get an odd hang after the first call + 15 seconds that I can't figure out.</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought it was my Client as the Server's trace wasn't showing any faults. Then I found someone else's service with basicHttpBinding hosted online @ <a href=\"http://www.dimmiunapassword.com/wcf/PwdService.svc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dimmiunapassword.com/wcf/PwdService.svc</a> that works fine. I can make a request, wait 20 seconds, make another and its successful.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it may be a problem with something I am doing in my service then, so I created a new basic service that returns a modified string... it's actually the New Project Template with nothing changed. That way I knew it was nothing with my more complex service returning larger amounts of data (although it works fine on my localhost). Unfortunately I'm having the same issue. I can make the first call fine and subsequent calls within 15 seconds go through fine, but if I wait 20 seconds- the Client will Timeout on the 1 minute default mark.</p>\n\n<p>After the Client times out, I can recall the service and the call goes through fine but exhibits the same 15 second behavior. If I wait long enough after the first call, say 10 minutes, another call will go through fine as well, almost like a Timeout is being triggered on the server and then resets to work again. On the flip-side, if the Client times out at the 1 minute default, it's almost like that resets the server as well.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried closing the service after each call. I've tried wrapping the channel and closing/disposing. I've tried a Using statement to close. Nothing worked. I think I've tried nearly every configuration for Concurrency, Instancing, Throttling, Sessioning, Timeouts, and Size limits with no luck. I've also traced the client and server, the client shows a timeout fault and the server shows nothing but the last successful request. The only thing I can notice is the \"Thread ID\" in the Clients trace changes and every time, it fails throwing a Timeout fault @ 1 minute (default). I can request 10+ calls within 15 seconds of the first call and they all process on the same \"Thread ID\" in the trace... as soon as it hits 15 seconds, the Thread ID changes and that's when the Client just hangs until the Timeout.</p>\n\n<p>I am stumped.

It talks about WCF becoming slow after the threads idle for 15 seconds but in my case it flat times out. In the Trace Logs I noticed the Thread ID changing after 15 seconds and that sounds exactly like this Threadpool issue though. I'm going to give this a try and see if it works tonight or tomorrow. I'll report back.</p>\n\n<h1>Edit #2</h1>\n\n<p>Edit #1 did not help so to further test\\debug, I managed to host the same WCF Service on a different Server/Domain than Godaddy and the WCF Service worked as it should. No problems at all. \nI'm in the process of trying to solve this through Godaddy now, it really seems like something on their end. I'll update the thread with anything new once I find out.</p>\n\n<h1>Edit #3</h1>\n\n<p>After about 2 weeks of trying to debug myself and another week waiting for GoDaddy to understand what my problem was <em>(I finally directed them to this StackOverflow page)</em>, the WCF Service is finally working correctly. Turns out, it was something with GoDaddy's server. I'm not exactly sure what was causing the issue but they migrated me to another server and whala, works perfect. Hopefully this saves someone time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","dependency-properties"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13258936,"title":"Custom DependencyProperty with custom datatype","body":"<p>I want to create a custom DependencyProperty for a usercontrol</p>\n\n<pre><code> public Table Grids\n    {\n        get { return (Table)GetValue(GridsProperty); }\n        set { SetValue(GridsProperty, value); }\n    }\n\n    // Using a DependencyProperty as the backing store for Grids.

At the moment I have something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public sealed class MyPath : Shape\n{\n    // This class has a Data property of type Geometry just like the normal Path class\n\n    protected override Geometry DefiningGeometry\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            Geometry data = Data;\n\n            if (data == null)\n            {\n                data = Geometry.Empty;\n            }\n\n            return data;\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnRender(DrawingContext drawingContext)\n    {\n        Transform tr = RenderedGeometry.Transform;\n        Geometry geomToDraw = RenderedGeometry.Clone();\n        geomToDraw.Transform = new MatrixTransform(tr.Value * tr.Value);\n        Matrix trInv = tr.Value; trInv.Invert();\n        drawingContext.PushTransform(new MatrixTransform(trInv));\n        drawingContext.DrawGeometry(Brushes.Transparent, new Pen() { Brush = Brushes.Black, Thickness = 1 }, geomToDraw);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As is clearly evident, I am quite new to this and the above code is probably completely messed up. I was trying to transfer the matrix to the geometry without changing the final resulting geometry transform, hence the tr.Value*tr.Value and trInv. But it does not work as I want it to. I know this transfer transform technique works in theory because I tried it out with constant transforms (testing to set Geometry.Transform to scale x with 4 and pushing a transform to scale x with 0.25 worked fine but the resulting shape drawing did not seem to apply stretch=fill, which I rely upon). So there must be something that I am missing with the render transforms.</p>\n\n<p>The test scenario that is not working is this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I apply a render scale transform with scaleX=4 and scaleY=1 in xaml.</li>\n<li>The built-in Path class scales the entire drawing so that strokes 4 times wider in the x direction than in the y direction.</li>\n<li>I want MyPath to scale the geometry only, not the strokes. &lt;- THIS IS NOT WORKING!\n<ul>\n<li>What happens is: The geometry gets scaled correctly, the strokes get scaled by 4 in the x direction and by slightly less than 4 in the y direction. What is wrong? I have a feeling that I should not be working solely with RenderedGeometry.Transform but what should I use instead? I need to incorporate the render transform and the stretch=fill on the shape. My render transforms hierarchy may contain a mix of scales, rotations and translations so the solution must be general enough to handle any transform, not just axis-aligned scaling.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: I know it is bad to create the geometry in OnRender but I want to get it working before spending time cleaning it up.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I read this post:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724139/invariant-stroke-thickness-of-path-regardless-of-the-scale\">Invariant stroke thickness of Path regardless of the scale</a></p>\n\n<p>The problem as stated before is that I do have to take render transforms into consideration and I am not sure of how to adapt that solution to work with them.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","c#-4.0","xamdatagrid"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13256056,"title":"How to add a tooltip to the XamDataGrid record programmatically","body":"<p>I already know how to set the tooltip for a XamDataGrid using a style, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Style TargetType={x:Type ig:DataRecordCellArea&gt;...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, for a specific reason (don't have time to explain it all), I really need to invoke the tooltip programmatically, preferably hooked to a <code>MouseOver</code> event. </p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate it if someone could illustrate the way.

I want to visualise a continuous data stream (maximum 1000 values per second but could be reduced). This data stream should be visualised as a chart - being more precise it's a visualisation of an ECG among other things. \nMy first idea was using polyline and bind it to a point collection. The problem here is that nothing is shown on the UI. Perhaps it's a wrong aproach for this task. Better ideas are welcomed. Here ist my code so far. First the View:\n<pre><code> \n<code>&lt;Canvas&gt;</code>\n  <code>&lt;Polyline Points=\"{Binding Points}\" Stroke=\"Red\" StrokeThickness=\"2\" /&gt;</code>\n<code>&lt;/Canvas&gt;</code>\n</pre></code></p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicity I use the code-behind even though I use the MVVM-pattern. That's also the reason why I want to use the binding and not just the name of the polyline and add the values.\n<pre><code>\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n   private short[] data = new short[]{ 10,30,50,70,90,110,130,150,170,190,210 };\n   private short[] data1 = new short[] { 15,14,16,13,17,12,18,11,19,10,24 };</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public MainWindow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.Length; i++)\n        {\n            Points.Add(new Point(data[i], data1[i]));\n        }\n    }\n\n    private PointCollection _points = new PointCollection();\n    public PointCollection Points\n    {\n        get { return _points; }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}\n</pre></code>\nI know that is no good coding style but for first tests its enough for me.

Each of these Container objects in turn has a DataItem (or a derivate) in a list. In a typical scenario a user will have 15-20 Container objects with 1000-5000 DataItems each. Then there are some DataMatcher objects that can be used for different types of searches. These work mostly fine (since I have several hundered unit tests on them), but in order to make my WPF application feel snappy and responsive, I decided that I should use the ThreadPool for this task. Thus I have a DataItemCommandRunner which runs on a Container object, and basically performs each delegate in a list it takes as a parameter on each DataItem in turn; I use the ThreadPool to queue up one thread for each Container, so that the search in theory should be as efficient as possible on multicore computers etc.</p>\n\n<p>This is basically done in a DataItemUpdater class that looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DataItemUpdater\n{\n    private Container ch;\n    private IEnumerable&lt;DataItemCommand&gt; cmds;\n\n    public DataItemUpdater(Container container, IEnumerable&lt;DataItemCommand&gt; commandList)\n    {\n        ch = container;\n        cmds = commandList;\n    }\n\n    public void RunCommandsOnContainer(object useless)\n    {\n        Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.AboveNormal;\n        foreach (DataItem di in ch.ItemList)\n        {\n            foreach (var cmd in cmds)\n            {\n                cmd(sh);\n            }\n        }\n        //Console.WriteLine(\"Done running for {0}\", ch.DisplayName);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(The useless object parameter for RunCommandsOnContainer is because I am experimenting with this with and without using threads, and one of them requires some parameter. Also, setting the priority to AboveNormal is just an experiment as well.)</p>\n\n<p>This works fine for all but one scenario - when I use the AllWordsMatcher object type that will look for DataItem objects containing all words being searched for (as opposed to any words, exact phrase or regular expression for instance).</p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty simple somestring.Contains(eachWord) based object, backed by unit tests. But herein lies some hairy strangeness.</p>\n\n<p>When the RunCommandsOnContainer runs using ThreadPool threads, it will return insane results. Say I have a string like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var someString = \"123123123 - just some numbers\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I run this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var res = someString.Contains(\"data\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When it runs, this will actually return true quite a lot - I have debugging information that shows it returning true for empty strings and other strings that simply do not contain the data. Also, it will some times return false even when the string actually contains the data being looked for.</p>\n\n<p>The kicker in all this? Why do I suspect the ThreadPool and not my own code?</p>\n\n<p>When I run the RunCommandsOnContainer() command for each Container in my main thread (i.e. locking the UI and everything), it works 100% correctly - every time!

The second service has methods to add new orders, edit orders and read them from database, and this service has a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The class Customer has a list of Suppliers (the suppliers from which the customer buys), the class Supplier has a list of Customers (the customers that buy from that supplier). The class order has a Customer, a Supplier and a list of Itens (and the itens are added to the database together with the order).</p>\n\n<p>The method for adding an order works fine, however, once an order has been added, the method to list the orders throws the TargetInvocationException. I searched a lot on the internet and the best answer I've found is that it's possibly a \"Ciclyc Reference\".</p>\n\n<p>The method to list the orders is inside the repository class and is simply:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public IQueryable&lt;Order&gt; ListOrders()\n{\n    return Context.Set&lt;Order&gt;().Include(x =&gt; x.Customer).Include(x =&gt; x.Supplier);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where Context is the entity framework context. I tried to remove the includes and load the customer and supplier separately, but the result was the same exception.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone please help me ? If I need to post more information just tell me. And sorry if this matter is trivial, I'm new to WPF and WCF so I'm still a little confused.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Exception below</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An error occurred while receiving the HTTP response to\n  <a href=\"http://SomeService.com/OrdersService.svc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://SomeService.com/OrdersService.svc</a>.

I want to persist the state of the IsExpanded property (and potentially other settings relating to the display of the group header). Normally you just have a class with the properties on it and bind to this. However, the data context for the group is CollectionViewGroup. Now this class isn't very helpful as it only gives you the Name property and the items in the group (which is fine if you just want a heading and maybe display some sort of metric based on the number of items in the group or their contents but not if you just want to store custom data about the state of the group header UI). What I'd like to do is to derive from this class and add other properties to my derived class and bind to that instead. But there doesn't seem to be any easy way to do this. All the details of group generation seem to be hidden away in internal classes which is very frustrating. Has anyone gone down the route of implementing ICollectionView themselves (and therefore all the other related classes as well presumably)? It seems like a massive job to replicate everything in ListCollectionView just to be able to create a custom CollectionViewGroup class and bind to that instead!

The main assumption in MVVM is that all the layers (View, ViewModel and Model) have to be independent. </p>\n\n<p>What's the best solution?

I would like to display a progress bar during that process while keeping the UI responsive of course. A cancel button would also be nice at a later stage.</p>\n\n<p>I've implemented this using Rx, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Get a list of all the files\nvar enumeratedFiles = Directory.EnumerateFiles(targetDirectory, \"*.*\", SearchOption.AllDirectories);\n\n// prepare the progress bar\n            double value = 0;\n            progBar.Minimum = 0;\n            progBar.Maximum = enumeratedFiles.Count();\n            progBar.Value = value;\n            progBar.Height = 15;\n            progBar.Width = 100;\n            statusBar.Items.Add(progBar);\n\nvar files = enumeratedFiles.ToObservable()\n                .SubscribeOn(TaskPoolScheduler.Default)\n                .ObserveOnDispatcher()\n                .Subscribe(x =&gt;\n                    {\n                        myDataSet.myTable.AddTableRow(System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(x));\n                        value++;\n                    },\n                    () =&gt;\n                    {\n                        myDataSetTableAdapter.Update(myDataSet.myTable);\n                        myDataSetTableAdapter.Fill(myDataSet.myTable);\n                        statusBar.Items.Remove(progBar);\n                    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, with the above example the UI is locked and the progress bar doesn't update during the process. I assume that's because the AddTableRow method is blocking the thread, although I believed that the SubscribeOn(TaskPoolScheduler) was supposed to run the task on a new thread?</p>\n\n<p>I've tried a few different approaches as well, with varying results. For example adding a .Do line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var files = enumeratedFiles.ToObservable()\n                .Do(x =&gt; myDataSet.myTable.AddTableRow(System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(x)))\n                .SubscribeOn(TaskPoolScheduler.Default)\n                .ObserveOnDispatcher()\n                .Subscribe(x =&gt;\n                    {\n                        value++;\n                    },\n                    () =&gt;\n                    {\n                        myDataSetTableAdapter.Update(myDataSet.myTable);\n                        myDataSetTableAdapter.Fill(myDataSet.myTable);\n                        statusBar.Items.Remove(progBar);\n                        btnCancel.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;\n                    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this actually shows the progress bar updates, and the UI is not completely locked but it is choppy and the performance crawls down...</p>\n\n<p>I've tried using a BackgroundWorker to do the same job, but the performance is way worse than the Rx approach above (for example, for 21000 files the Rx approach takes a few seconds while the BackgroundWorker a few minutes to finish).</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen similar problems being tackled with Delegates for the progress bar's ValueProperty method, but I would really like to solve this using Rx if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something obvious here? Any suggestion would be highly appreciated...</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","kinect"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":1,"question_id":13231646,"title":"Kinect Face tracking on a non UI thread","body":"<p>I am able to track the face when using all the streams (color,depth,skeleton) on the main UI thread.

Instead it... just doesn't do anything. I know that the style is being overwritten, because any <em>new</em> <code>VerseBlocks</code> will be whatever size I have selected, but I'm trying to impact all <code>VerseBlocks</code> without having to iterate over each one.

Frustrated I wrote two examples of this program, zipped them and uploaded them so you may download them in order to assist me. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://simpletechss.com/1stAidApp4.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simpletechss.com/1stAidApp4.zip</a> (shows 007 image from webbpage then hides after 10 seconds.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://simpletechss.com/1stAidApp35.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simpletechss.com/1stAidApp35.zip</a> (does not show 007 image from webbpage, then hides after 10 seconds.) \nvb\nSo again I am wondering why i cannot show the 007 image from webbpage in a WPF using .Net 3.5 but can in .Net 4.0?

Your MainView is a grid, and one of the cells you want to populate with either AView or BView, depending on user choices.

ViewModelToShow{ get; set;}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then in the code, e.g., set the viewmodel to show:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ViewModelToShow = _BVM; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My only problem are the \"...\", since each ViewModel is of a different class. Is there a way to do this with generics, or should I define a base class for my ViewModels to which I cast them? But if I do that, will they still be displayed properly.

Only when I press the <code>Cancel</code> button or close the window.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions for the uninformed?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","data-binding","treeview","recursive-databinding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":13196892,"title":"Recursive databinding on treeview","body":"<p>I want to view a folder structure in a treeview using a databinding. \nThe folder class just has a property list of children and a property name.</p>\n\n<p>If something changes it will fire the according event.\nThis is it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public class Folder : INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyCollectionChanged\n    {    \n        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;           \n        public event NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler CollectionChanged; \n\n        public Folder(string name)\n        {\n            this.Name = name;\n            this.ContentFolders = new List&lt;Folder&gt;();\n        }\n\n        public List&lt;Folder&gt; ContentFolders { get; set; }\n\n        public void AddFolder(Folder f)\n        {\n            this.ContentFolders.Add(f);\n\n            if (this.CollectionChanged != null)\n            {\n                this.NotifyCollectionChanged(\n                      new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(\n                          NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, f));\n            }\n            this.PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(\"ContentFolders\"));\n        }\n\n        private void NotifyCollectionChanged(NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            lock (CollectionChanged)\n            {\n                if (CollectionChanged != null)\n                {\n                    Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =&gt; CollectionChanged(this, e)));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        private string name;\n\n        public string Name\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return this.name;\n            }\n            set\n            {\n                if (this.name != value)\n                {\n                    this.name = value;\n                    if (PropertyChanged != null)\n                    {\n                        PropertyChanged(\n                            this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(\"Name\"));\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my GUI, which shows the root folder in a treeview:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;Window x:Class=\"WpfApplication2.MyWindow\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\" xmlns:WpfApplication2=\"clr-namespace:WpfApplication2\"\n            Title=\"MyWindow\" Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\" xmlns:u=\"clr-namespace:UpdateControls.XAML;assembly=UpdateControls.XAML\"&gt;\n      &lt;StackPanel&gt;\n        &lt;StackPanel.Resources&gt;\n          &lt;HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType=\"{x:Type WpfApplication2:Folder}\"\n                                    ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path=ContentFolders}\"&gt;\n            &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Path=Name}\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;/StackPanel.Resources&gt;\n        &lt;TreeView Name=\"TreeviewScenario\"&gt;\n          &lt;TreeViewItem Header=\"{Binding Path=RootFolder.Name}\"\n                        ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path=RootFolder.ContentFolders}\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/TreeView&gt;\n        &lt;Button Content=\"Add Folder\" Click=\"Button_Click\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n    &lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The according MyWindow.xaml.cs class has a property Folder and adds some content.

(I show this page in a frame, that frame is the main content of my window: when I place the frame in a grid it didn't show objects)\nSeems This Occure on laptop with shared graphics</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2:

It now produces a different triangulation than Cutting Ears but respects the boundaries of the outer polyline.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCh5U.jpg\" alt=\"ComplexPoly\"> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ujKic.jpg\" alt=\"ComplexCDT\"> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MlQkb.jpg\" alt=\"ComplexEars\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","tooltip"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13178134,"title":"How to bind the visibility of tooltip to the text in textblock?","body":"<pre><code>   &lt;DataGrid x:Name=\"dgRecords1\"  CanUserAddRows=\"False\" ColumnHeaderStyle=\"{DynamicResource DataGridColumnHeaderStyle1}\" IsReadOnly=\"True\"\n                     Style=\"{DynamicResource StyleDatagrid}\" SelectionChanged=\"dgRecords1_SelectionChanged\" Height=\"251\" Margin=\"41,173,168,0\" Width=\"569\"&gt;                    \n                &lt;DataGrid.RowStyle&gt; \n                    &lt;Style TargetType=\"DataGridRow\"&gt;                            \n                        &lt;Setter Property=\"ToolTip\"&gt;                               \n                            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n                                &lt;Border Width=\"200\" Height=\"80\" BorderBrush=\"Black\" BorderThickness=\"1\" Background=\"AliceBlue\"&gt;\n                                    &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Vertical\"&gt;\n                                        &lt;StackPanel Height=\"30\" Background=\"Black\"&gt;\n                                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\"Email Sent To\" FontSize=\"14\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" Foreground=\"White\"/&gt;\n                                        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n                                        &lt;StackPanel&gt;\n                                            &lt;TextBlock TextWrapping=\"Wrap\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" Text=\"{Binding SentToList}\" /&gt;\n                                        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n                                    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n                                &lt;/Border&gt;                                    \n                            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;                                  \n                        &lt;/Setter&gt;                                      \n                    &lt;/Style&gt;                        \n                &lt;/DataGrid.RowStyle&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, </p>\n\n<pre><code>   &lt;TextBlock TextWrapping=\"Wrap\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" Text=\"{Binding SentToList}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to check whether there is something in this textblock, if there is nothing,i need to make the tooltip invisible.

All I can report is that this \"sensitive\" function is overloaded, the custom class WashPkg has the attribute [serializable()], and the class in which this function resides is static. If I modify the function declaration so that the type of List is int instead of WashPkg, the problem is also resolved. \nSo at this point it's still a mystery as to why the designer doesn't like that function declaration.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","validation","wpf-usercontrols","adornerdecorator"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":1,"question_id":13111380,"title":"Validated Textbox in a UserControl","body":"<p>I have created a UserControl - a Labeled TextBox which is working pretty well, except for the validation template.

I noticed that when I scroll down the grid, the scrollbar thumb changes its height.</p>\n\n<p>After some investigations I discovered that this is caused by UI virtualization: the grid doesn't create all the items so it doesn't know the total height of the grid, so instead it determines the total height by calculating the average row height of the rows it did create, and multiply this by the row count. This causes the thumb to change its size during scrolling since the virtualization creates new items and destroys the ones that are no longer displayed, which makes the grid think the total grid size has changed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question</strong>: Is there a way I can set the scroll thumb size myself using my own heuristics?

Should I be doing something other than InteractionRequest?  I generally do web applications so WPF is a bit new to me.</p>\n\n<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":13152735,"title":"How to Print without displaying a print popup in WPF","body":"<pre><code>private void btnPrint_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            PrintDialog dialog = new PrintDialog();\n            if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true)\n            {\n                StackPanel stpanel;\n                stpanel = PrintStakPanel;\n                stpanel.Measure(new Size(Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.PositiveInfinity));\n                Size grdSize = stpanel.DesiredSize;\n                Point grdPoint = new Point((dialog.PrintableAreaWidth - grdSize.Width) / 2, (dialog.PrintableAreaHeight - grdSize.Height) / 2);\n                stpanel.Arrange(new Rect(grdPoint, grdSize));\n                Grid.SetRow(stpanel, 0);\n                dialog.PrintVisual(stpanel, \"Cinema Ticket\");\n\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","mvvm","architecture","preferences"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":2,"question_id":13159460,"title":"How to create a program architecture for user preferences using MVVM","body":"<p>I am trying to create a preference window for users, which they can manipulate (change preferences).\nI want to implement it in a proper way so do you have any suggestions for a good code architecture?

The textbox has UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged attribute set. The same property can also be modified from some backend code instead of being modified by user through the .xaml UI dialog. There is a requirement that if the property value is \"changed\" from the .xaml UI dialog, it toggles a flag to indicate that the user has changed the value. However, changes made from the backend code will not be toggle this flag. What is the best way to satisfy the above requirement given the fact that there are many .xaml files involved? I am thinking that if there is a way to find out the source in the property setter, then I will have a centralized mechanism to check if the value change comes from the bound TextBox and toggles the external flag.

Here is the code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>XAML:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox Grid.Row=\"0\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding DaughterBoardBoxList}\" SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedDaughterBoardBoxList, Mode=TwoWay}\" SelectedIndex=\"0\" /&gt;\n&lt;ComboBox Grid.Row=\"1\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding DaughterVersionBoxList}\" SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedDaughterVersionBoxList, Mode=TwoWay}\" SelectedIndex=\"0\" /&gt;\n&lt;ComboBox Grid.Row=\"2\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding DaughterSerialBoxList}\" SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedDaughterSerialBoxList, Mode=TwoWay}\" SelectedIndex=\"0\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>ViewModel Class:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt; DaughterBoardBoxList\n    {\n        get { return _DBoardBoxList; }\n        set\n        {\n            _DBoardBoxList = value;\n            OnPropertyChanged(\"DaughterBoardBoxList\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public string _SelectedDBoardBoxList;\n    public string SelectedDaughterBoardBoxList\n    {\n        get { return _SelectedDBoardBoxList; }\n        set\n        {\n            _SelectedDBoardBoxList = value;\n            OnPropertyChanged(\"SelectedDaughterBoardBoxList\");\n        }\n    }\n\n// Similarly for other 2 comboboxes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have added items in each combobox as follows: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DaughterBoardBoxItems = \"S1010013\", \"S1010014\", \"S1010015\" etc</li>\n<li>DaughterVersionBoxItems =  \"001A\", \"001B\", \"001C\" etc</li>\n<li>DaughterSerialBoxItems = 1 to 499</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I Have added from 1 - 499 as follows: </p>\n\n<pre><code>for (int j = 1; j &lt; 500; j++)\n{\n      _DSerialBoxList.Add(j.ToString());\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now on performing some operation I need to execute few statements which are as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>String daughterBoard = \"S1010015001A0477\"; // Hardcoded value for check\nString boardName = daughterBoard.Substring(0, 8);\nDaughterBoardBoxList = boardName;\n\nString version = daughterBoard.Substring(8, 12);\nDaughterVersionBoxList = version;\n\nint serialvalue = Convert.ToInt32(daughterBoard.Substring(12, 16));\nString serialNo = Convert.ToString(serialvalue);\nDaughterSerialBoxList = serialNo;\n\nlonglabel += daughterBoard;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I execute the above code, it throws me exception at <code>String version = daughterBoard.Substring(8, 12);</code> as <code>Argumentoutofrange. Index and length must refer to a location within the string.</code></p>\n\n<p>Requirement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Now this where I am confused how do I set the values present in <code>boardName</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>serialNo</code> in the combobox without having to face any exception. I don think combobox has settext property. Is their an other alternative solution to achieve this?</p></li>\n<li><p>Even though I enter values from 0 to 499, it should appear as 4 digit value i.e. if 77 is added, it should appear as 0077. As I have mentioned in the above code.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please help :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","resourcedictionary","prism-4"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":117,"score":1,"question_id":12066125,"title":"How to set a relative path/Uri in ResourceDictionary's source","body":"<p>I am trying to refer to a MergedDictionaries.SharedStyles project which has all Styles that has to be used allover application.

Example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MW13N.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n\n<p>There is not pop outs, or details <strong>Anywhere</strong> about what is wrong, only a callstack that points to my <code>InitializeComponent()</code> call.</p>\n\n<p>Now normally I'd just do some trial and error to fix this problem, and find out where i messed up, but the real problem isn't my code. Visual Studio is rendered <em>completely useless</em> at this point. It reports my application still in \"Running\" mode. The Stop/Break/Restart buttons on the toolbar or in the menus don't do anything (but grey out).</p>\n\n<p>Closing the application does not stop this behaviour, closing visual studio gets it stuck in a massive loop where it yells at me complaining every file open is not in the debug project, then repeats this process when i have exausted every open file.</p>\n\n<p>I have to force-close <code>devenv.exe</code>, and after this happening 3-4 times in a row it's a lot of wasted time (as my projects are usually pretty big and studio can be quite slow @ loading).</p>\n\n<p><strong>To the point</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Has anyone else experienced this?</li>\n<li>How can I stop studio from locking up.</li>\n<li>Can I at LEAST get information out of this beast another way so i can fix my XAML error sooner rather than after 3-4 trial-and-error compiles yielding the same crash?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any &amp; All help would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Studio 2010 version: <code>10.0.30319.1RTM</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit &amp; Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>FWIW, mostly the errors that cause this are <code>XamlParseExceptions</code> (I figured this out after i found what was wrong with my XAML). </p>\n\n<p><em>I think I need to be clearer though</em>, Im not looking for the solution to my code problem, as these are usually typos / small things, <strong>I'm looking for a solution to VStudio getting all buggered up as a result.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The particular error in the above image that 100% for sure caused this was a <code>XamlParseException</code> caused by forgetting a <code>Value</code> attribute on a data trigger.</p>\n\n<p>I've fixed that part but it still doesn't tell my why my studio becomes a lump of neutered program when a perfectly normal exception is thrown in the parsing of the XAML.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code that will cause this issue (at least for me)</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the base template WPF Application, with the following <code>Window.xaml</code> code. The problem is a missing <code>Value=\"True\"</code> on the <code>&lt;DataTrigger ...&gt;</code> in the template.

Here is the code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>XAML:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox Height=\"23\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding BoardBoxList}\" SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedBoardBoxList, Mode=TwoWay}\" SelectedIndex=\"0\" Name=\"comboBox2\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>ViewModel Class:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt; BoardBoxList\n    {\n        get { return _BoardBoxList; }\n        set\n        {\n            _BoardBoxList = value;\n            OnPropertyChanged(\"BoardBoxList\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// _SelectedBoardBoxList\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    private string _SelectedBoardBoxList;\n    public string SelectedBoardBoxList\n    {\n        get { return _SelectedBoardBoxList; }\n        set\n        {\n            _SelectedBoardBoxList = value;\n            OnPropertyChanged(\"SelectedBoardBoxList\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here Is how I had added items in my combobox in C++:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static const signed char boards[][9] = {\n{},                                           // left blank to indicate no selection\n{ 'S', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '2', 0 },   // redhook\n{ 'S', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '8', 0 },   // bavaria\n{ 'S', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '2', '0', 0 },   // flying dog\n};\n\nm_boardBox = new ComboBox(String::empty);\nfor(int i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++)\n    m_boardBox-&gt;addItem(String((char*)(boards[i])), i); \nm_boardBox-&gt;setSelectedId(2); // select Bavaria by default\naddAndMakeVisible(m_boardBox);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you notice above, you will find the loop adding items easily. This is how i wanna add items to my combobox.</p>\n\n<p>If I use <code>_BoardBoxList.Add(\"....\");</code> I will have to use many .Adds. Is their an efficient way where I can store the items in a list/collection and add them into the combobox in the form of <code>for loop</code> just like above?</p>\n\n<p>Please help :) </p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","binding","checkbox","listbox","datatemplate"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13118028,"title":"CheckBox as datatemplate in a ListBox reset IsChecked value when scrolling","body":"<p>I want to start using MVVM in my project so I have started to investigate it.\nWhile I was playing a bit with WPF I've encountered a bug that I couldn't find a solution to him by myself and while exploring internet.</p>\n\n<p>I have something like that(I can't paste my full code because its not in the same network):</p>\n\n<p>MainView.Xaml</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=\"{Binding Persons}\"&gt;\n &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n  &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n   &lt;CheckBox Content=\"{Binding Name}\"&gt;\n    &lt;i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;\n     &lt;i:EventTrigger EventName=\"Checked\"&gt;\n        &lt;my:AddToInvitation /&gt;\n     &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;\n     &lt;i:EventTrigger EventName=\"Unchecked\"&gt;\n        &lt;my:RemoveFromInvitation /&gt;\n     &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;\n    &lt;/i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;\n   &lt;/CheckBox&gt;\n  &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n&lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>MainViewModel.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;PersonViewModel&gt; Persons { get; set; }\n\npublic MainViewModel()\n{\n  this.Persons = new ObservableCollection&lt;PersonViewModel&gt;();\n  for(int i=0;i&lt;1000;i++)\n  {\n     PersonViewModel personVM = new PersonViewModel (string.Format(\"Person - {0}\",i));\n     this.Persons.add(personVM);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PersonViewModel.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>private Person PersonObject { get; set; }\n\npublic string Name\n{\n  get\n  {\n     return this.PersonObject.Name;\n  }\n}\n\npublic PersonViewModel(string personName)\n{\n  this.PersonObject = new Person(personName);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Person.cs</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string Name { get; set; }\n\npublic Person(string name)\n{\n   this.Name = name;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if you try to paste it and run it, it will look just fine.\nThe problem is when you try the following instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1) Check the first 10 persons in the ListBox.\n2) Scroll down the ListBox to the bottom of it.\n3) Leave the mouse when the list box is scrolled down.\n4) Scroll back up to the top of the ListBox.\n5) Poof! you'r checking disappeared.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the solution i have found to this is to add IsChecked property(Though I don't really need it) to the PersonViewModel and bind it to the CheckBox IsChecked DependencyProperty, but then I have added a functionality that lets the user to press a button and it will iterate over all the persons in the ListBox and change it IsChecked property to true(Button -> Select all).\nFollowing to the disappear Checks bug I have crossed another bug which I believe somehow is connected to the disappearing Checks - the actions that I have put to trigger when Check and Uncheck occurs would trigger only for some of the CheckBoxes when you select all.\nI tried to count how many times the actions would happen when I used the select all function and I found a connection between the height of the ListBox(Current Visible CheckBoxes) and the amount of the triggers that fired, furthermore I scrolled to the middle of the ListBox and used the SelectAll functionality and the triggers didn't fire until the loop encountered the first visible ChekBox that I can see in my ListBox.</p>\n\n<p>Its a bit hard to understand this bug if you don't try it, so please comment here only if you tried this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","writeablebitmapex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12711555,"title":"Bit blit Bitmaps (WriteableBitmapEx Framework)","body":"<p>I've not fully understand the basics of Bit blit bitmaps.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using the WriteableBitmapEx framework (WPF).

to use String.Format to display Version String in WPF","body":"<p>I am a C++ developer and recently shifted to C#. I am working on a wpf app where I need to work on <code>String.Format</code>. In My C++ application, I had used <code>sprintf</code> to obtain the result but when it comes to C#, string.format helped me achieve it. Now I have come across a tricky situation where I need to achieve the similar thing but with different values. Here Is the C++ code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char t_str[4] = {};\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)\n{ \n    sprintf(t_str, \"%02X\", buffer[i]);\nm_apiResponse[i]-&gt;setText(String(t_str));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>buffer[0] = 20;\n                buffer[1] = 30;\n                buffer[2] = 40;\n                buffer[3] = 50;</code> and <code>m_apiResponse</code> is a textbox.</p>\n\n<p>Even though <code>string.format</code> was also helpful, I rather choose the easiset way of doing it. I had done this in my C# as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Response1Box = buffer[0].ToString(\"X2\");\nResponse2Box = buffer[1].ToString(\"X2\");\nResponse3Box = buffer[2].ToString(\"X2\");\nResponse4Box = buffer[3].ToString(\"X2\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It worked well and gave me the answer i wanted.

codebehind, during the _loaded event, I load some data and assign it to the TreeView's datacontext via a well-implemented ObservableCollection.\nOn the TreeView's SelectedItemChanged event, I load related records and hookup property-changed handlers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window

Hereby I'm trying to learn about inheritance, code reuse, using classes far more extensively, and so on.\nFor this purpose I am trying to piece together all the parts required for a basic RPG/dungeon crawler.\nI know this has been done a billion times before, but I find that actually trying to code something like it takes you through a lot more problems than you might think, which is a great way to learn (I think).</p>\n\n<p>For now I have only loaded up a WPF application, since my interest is 95% on being able to piece together the working classes, routines, functions, etc. And not so much interested in how it will look. I am actually reading up on XNA, but since I am mostly trying to get a grip on the basic workings, I don't want to complicate those aspects with the graphical side of things just yet.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I am now facing is that when I would a character to attack or defend, it should know from which other character it came, or to which one it should be pointed. I figured I could either use a GUID, or a manually appointed ID. But the problem is that I don't really know how I can implement such a thing.\nThe thing that I figured was that I could maybe add a reference to an array (Character[]), and have a SearchByID function loop through them to find the right one, and return it. Like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>internal Character SearchByID(string _ID)\n{\n   foreach(Character charToFind in Character[])\n   {\n       if(charToFind.ID == _ID)\n       return charToFind;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This of course has to be altered a bit due to the return at the moment, but just to give you an idea.\nWhat I am stuck on is how to create the appropriate array outside of the \"Character\"-class? I can fill it up just fine, but how do I go about having it added above class level?\nThe way the \"Character\"-class is built up is that every new character instantiates from the Character class. The constructor then loads the appropriate values. But other than this, I see no possibility to initialize an array outside of this.</p>\n\n<p>If it is preferable to post the entire code that I have, that will be no problem at all!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any insights you may provide me with.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","c++",".net","wpf","string"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":3,"question_id":13089296,"title":"Failing to use String.Format in C#","body":"<p>I am a C++ developer and shifted to wpf last week.

Let's say I have arbitrary complex controls under my TreeViewItems that can take a long time - let's say 10ms - to be measured. Scrolling down the TreeView can quickly become very laggy, as the Layout pass is called for each scroll unit down.</p>\n\n<p>What would be your ideas to get a smooth scrolling in this case ?\nI tried two different approaches but I'm having issues with both. </p>\n\n<p>First one was to buffer the last MeasureOverride result and use it instead of calling MeasureOverride again unless size changed. It's working as long as I have only one hierarchy level in the tree. But as soon as I get more, some items are not rendered (although the size is correctly reserved). Invalidating the buffer will not be an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Second one was to replace ControlTemplate of controls under treeViewItems during scroll thanks to a Trigger, using a ControlTemplate very quick to render.

It works at start up, but not when I am changing the values in runtime. </p>\n\n<p>I have also tried to do similar things with the properties in the view model.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the solution is fairly simple and has something to do with the bindings, but I still can't find it.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is what it looks like:\n<a href=\"http://s16.postimage.org/glcg9elth/Temp.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"User interface image\">User interface image</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the view XAML code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=\"Temperature.MainWindow\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    xmlns:extToolkit=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation/toolkit/extended\"\n    Title=\"Temperature converter\" Height=\"183\" Width=\"468\"&gt;\n&lt;Grid VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\"&gt;\n    &lt;Label Content=\"Kelvin\" Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"10,10,0,0\" Name=\"label1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" /&gt;\n    &lt;extToolkit:DoubleUpDown Name=\"_KelvinUD\" Increment=\"0.1\" FormatString=\"F2\" Value=\"{Binding Kelvin}\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Width=\"100\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Margin=\"113,14,0,0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Label Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"279,10,0,0\" Name=\"label4\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Content=\"{Binding Kelvin}\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;Label Content=\"Celsius\" Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"12,44,0,0\" Name=\"label2\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" /&gt;\n    &lt;extToolkit:DoubleUpDown Name=\"_CelsiusUD\" Increment=\"0.1\" FormatString=\"F2\" Value=\"{Binding Celsius}\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Width=\"100\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Margin=\"113,48,0,0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Label Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"279,44,0,0\" Name=\"label5\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Content=\"{Binding Celsius}\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;Label Content=\"Fahrenheit\" Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"12,78,0,0\" Name=\"label3\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" /&gt;\n    &lt;extToolkit:DoubleUpDown Name=\"_FarenheitUD\" Increment=\"0.1\" FormatString=\"F2\" Value=\"{Binding Fahrenheit}\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Width=\"100\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Margin=\"113,82,0,0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Label Height=\"28\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"279,78,0,0\" Name=\"label6\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Content=\"{Binding Fahrenheit}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The code behind:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Windows;\nusing System.Windows.Controls;\nusing System.Windows.Data;\nusing System.Windows.Documents;\nusing System.Windows.Input;\nusing System.Windows.Media;\nusing System.Windows.Media.Imaging;\nusing System.Windows.Navigation;\nusing System.Windows.Shapes;\n\nnamespace Temperature\n{\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window\n    {\n        private TempViewModel _viewModel = new TempViewModel();\n        TempViewModel ViewModel\n        {\n            get { return _viewModel;

The result is the custom control has the proper visibility but the stack panel does not. I'm pretty sure that the binding itself is working as the path for the bindings on the two controls is the same, and works for the custom control.

Ive created a new Static Resource extension that does exactly the same but loads a different resource dictionary, the first entry of which is as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ResourceDictionary xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"                     \n                    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;Border x:Key=\"Default\" Width=\"15\" Height=\"15\" BorderThickness=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/Border&gt;\n\n        &lt;Border x:Key=\"..\\Resources\\Images\\AccountOnly.ico\" Width=\"15\" Height=\"15\" BorderThickness=\"0\" CornerRadius=\"4,4,4,4\" Background=\"#22bb22\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"&gt;\n            &lt;Path StrokeThickness=\"1.5\" Stroke=\"#FFFFFFFF\" Data=\"M 2,4 C 2,4 10,4 9,12 M 2,7 C 2,7 7,7 6,12 M 2,10.5 L 4,10.5\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/Border&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I am hoping to look up this bordered drawing by key (as all icons can be represented by a border surrounding a drawing but cannot figure out what to do.

To find the correct table it first needs to know the name of the table. When the enum value is passed into the converter via the Convert method it is possible to find this. When the string is passed into the converter via the ConvertBack method it isn't (enum types are unique, but the string values are not). </p>\n\n<p>The converter is used on DataTemplates for editors used in a Data Grid and a Property Grid.</p>\n\n<p>In one case it is possible to pass the name of the table in as the ConverterParameter, as the DataTemplate is dynamically generated. In the other it does not seem possible to do this. My current solution looks up the table name in the Convert method and stores it for use in the ConvertBack method (i.e. the IValueConverter maintains state between calls to Convert and ConvertBack). This assumes that Convert will always be called before ConvertBack, which does not seem like a safe assumption. I'm using a per binding instance of the converter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;converters:EnumToStringConverter x:Key=\"EnumToStringConverter\" x:Shared=\"False\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this safe or will this come back to haunt me?

Once a listview is inside a scrollviewer it does use it's maximum size and doesn't scroll itself cause the scrollviewer offers unlimited amount of space to the controls inside of it.\nThe problem is, that controls that are below a long list are only visible if the user scrolls down and I want to make the listview only use the space that is necessary and use a scrollbar itself.

Hopefully it should use the same thing Aero glass uses (I'm fine with it working only with Aero enabled), instead of something crazy like capturing the screen region below as a bitmap and blurring that.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture of what I DON'T want:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/WZcr8.png\" alt=\"I don't want the entire Aero glass window chrome\"></p>\n\n<p>I know this is possible and I know how to do it, but I DON'T want the entire Aero glass window chrome, or the borders and title bar, or the window to have the user-set Aero glass color, JUST the effect of blurring whatever is below the window/form.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","global-variables"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9224,"score":2,"question_id":1161459,"title":"WPF Application using a global variable","body":"<p>I created a WPF application in c# with 3 different windows, Home.xaml, Name.xaml, Config.xaml.

Any new incoming Nodes ( another PC ) comes a life and starts sending packets ( data items) ,I can see the new node in the treeview but i cannot see the data items under that node. </p>\n\n<p>Any idea  ? </p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml",".net-4.0","initializecomponent"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":2,"question_id":13017192,"title":"InitializeComponent equivalent for xaml","body":"<p>In some of my smoke tests, I'm using <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mono Cecil</a> to parse the opcodes of my assemblies.

This works fine for all the controls in the form. I know that <code>ContentPresenter</code> is a lightweight form of <code>ContentControl</code> and that it's more suitable to use inside a content template than the<code>ContentControl</code> is. However, I don't quite understand why the bindings fail when using a <code>ContentPresenter</code> and work when using a <code>ContentControl</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I also find it odd that only a limited set of controls work, and when not using the AdornerDecorator none of them will find the binding source.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone come across something similar?

Loading it up in VS2010, the editor works fine, no errors whatsoever - the same even in Expression Blend.</p>\n\n<p>So far I have tried the typical clean, rebuild, manually deleting stuff from obj, updating the .xaml and rebuilding, tried starting VS2012 with /resetuserdata and /resetsettings - the problem persists. I even rolled back to a much older revision of my project, back when the designer was working just fine, no dice - same error. I also tried launching VS2012 as a new windows user to avoid any stored appdata that might be lingering, again a no go.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some other sort of cache or something that I could manually delete?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","xaml","tooltip"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":16,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14800,"score":16,"question_id":896574,"title":"Forcing a WPF tooltip to stay on the screen","body":"<p>I have a tooltip for a Label and I want it to stay open until the user\nmoves the mouse to a different control.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried the following properties on the tooltip:</p>\n\n<pre><code>StaysOpen=\"True\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>TooltipService.ShowDuration = \"60000\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But in both cases the tooltip is only displayed for exactly 5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Why are these values being ignored?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","winforms"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13006688,"title":"Intergerate WPF application module into Window Forms based application","body":"<p>I have create a wpf application which has one mainwindow.xaml and two user controls usercontrol.xaml and usercontrol2.xaml.</p>\n\n<p>Now i want this WPF application to be run under window form platform.

If any of the data changes, I want to run an animation that highlights the cell with the changed value in yellow and then fade back to white.

But, there are a few problems.</p>\n\n<p>First, when the data grid is initially loaded, the entire column is highlighted in yellow.  This makes sense, because all of the values are being loaded for the first time so you would expect TargetUpdated to fire.  I'm sure there is some way I can stop this, but it's a relatively minor point.</p>\n\n<p>The real problem is the entire column is highlighted in yellow if the grid is sorted or filtered in any way.  I guess I don't understand why a sort would cause TargetUpdated to fire since the data didn't change, just the way it is displayed.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is (1) how can I stop this behavior on initial load and sort/filter, and (2) am I on the right track and is this even a good way to do this?

So, now I'm asking for help, please :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The exception returned on line 45 of MainWindow.xaml.cs : </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"object because a different thread owns it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My MIDI Class:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing NAudio.Midi;\n\nnamespace StaveHelper\n{\npublic sealed class  MIDIMain \n{\n    private static MIDIMain midiMain = null;\n    public static int noteOnNumber;\n    public static int noteOffNumber;\n    public MidiIn midiIn;\n    public bool noteOn;\n    private bool monitoring;\n    private int midiInDevice;\n\n    private MIDIMain()\n    {\n        GetMIDIInDevices();\n    }\n\n    public static MIDIMain GetInstance()\n    {\n        if (null == midiMain)\n        {\n            midiMain = new MIDIMain();\n        }\n        return midiMain;\n    }\n\n\n    public string[] GetMIDIInDevices()\n    {\n        //Get a list of devices\n        string[] returnDevices = new string[MidiIn.NumberOfDevices];\n\n        //Get the product name for each device found\n        for (int device = 0;

The binding of the columns for the child complex object instances uses a subscript on the CustomObservableCollection&lt;> (custom collection allowing indexing by an generic value [enum ChildType] in this case). The binding in particular has made it difficult to properly set a value on a same property across multiple parent's child instances (via multi-select on a column and a context menu click to set a value). Again, I am handling these sort of mass changes in the code-behind on the View, using reflection a binding path parsing to set the property values (it feels wrong; hate doing it that way). I would like to be able to set the selected children on the ViewModel and pass the property name and new value for the property to a command in the ViewModel to make the changes. Even being able to pass the command the child type, property and new value would be nice (I think). </p>\n\n<p>My research through Google, stackoverflow, Code Project, etc. has pointed me toward my current solution but I feel I am thinking about the problem incorrectly and there should be a better MVVM approach to this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>The primary focus for this application is to allow the editing of multiple parent and child model instances in a view where the user can compare values of several instances and be allowed to set the value of a parent or child property across multiple objects of the same type to the same value (i.e. Parent1 and Parent2 both have a ChildModel1 and user wants to set the Name on Property3 of both parent objects' ChildModel1 to \"X\").

What could work is binding to the items count and putting an IValueConverter on the binding like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Function Convert(value As Object, targetType As Type, _\n                        parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) _\n                        As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert\n    Dim isExpandedThreshold As Integer = CInt(Common.GetCode(\"ProgramParameters\", \"IsExpandedTreshold\"))\n    Dim currentNumberOfRows As Integer = CInt(value)\n    'return (isExpanded = False) if current number of rows is greater than the threshold\n    Return currentNumberOfRows &lt; isExpandedThreshold\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I can set the value of the <code>IsExpanded</code> property using the ItemCount and converter</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xaml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;loc:IntegerThresholdToBoolean x:Key=\"intThresholdtoBoolConverter\" /&gt;\n...\n&lt;Expander IsExpanded=\"{Binding Path=ItemCount, Converter={StaticResource intThresholdtoBoolConverter}, Mode=OneWay}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem is that I can't figure out how to access the ItemCount of the Primary Group when setting the Style on the secondary group.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's how I'm setting the group style on my <code>DataGrid</code></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xaml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;DataGrid.GroupStyle&gt;\n    &lt;!--Set Primary Group Style--&gt;\n    &lt;GroupStyle ContainerStyle=\"{StaticResource PrimaryGroupStyle}\" /&gt;\n    &lt;!--Set Secondary Group Style--&gt;\n    &lt;GroupStyle ContainerStyle=\"{StaticResource SecondaryGroup}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/DataGrid.GroupStyle&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's my primary group style Resource :</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xaml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;Style x:Key=\"PrimaryGroupStyle\" TargetType=\"{x:Type GroupItem}\"&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Margin\" Value=\"0,0,0,5\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Template\"&gt;\n        &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n            &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type GroupItem}\"&gt;\n                &lt;Expander IsExpanded=\"False\" Background=\"#DAD2B2\" BorderBrush=\"#DED5A1\" Foreground=\"Black\" BorderThickness=\"1,1,1,2\"&gt;\n                    &lt;Expander.Header&gt;\n                        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\"&gt;\n                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Path=Name}\"\n                                       FontWeight=\"Bold\"/&gt;\n                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\" returned \" FontWeight=\"Bold\" /&gt;\n                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Path=ItemCount}\" FontWeight=\"Bold\"/&gt;\n                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\" records \" FontWeight=\"Bold\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n                    &lt;/Expander.Header&gt;\n                    &lt;Expander.Content&gt;\n                        &lt;ItemsPresenter&gt;\n                        &lt;/ItemsPresenter&gt;\n                    &lt;/Expander.Content&gt;\n                &lt;/Expander&gt;\n            &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;\n    &lt;/Setter&gt;\n&lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the secondary style:  I'd like to find a way for the value of the IsExpanded property to be based on the item count of the primary group count.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xaml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;Style x:Key=\"SecondaryStyle\" TargetType=\"{x:Type GroupItem}\"&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Margin\" Value=\"0,0,0,5\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Template\"&gt;\n        &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n            &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type GroupItem}\"&gt;\n                &lt;Expander IsExpanded=\"False\" Background=\"#EFE7C8\" BorderBrush=\"#DED5A1\" Foreground=\"Black\" BorderThickness=\"0,0,0,0\"&gt;\n                    &lt;Expander.Header&gt;\n                        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\" Background=\"#EFE7C8\"&gt;\n                            &lt;TextBlock Text=\"Pair of records\" Foreground=\"Black\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n                    &lt;/Expander.Header&gt;\n                    &lt;Expander.Content&gt;\n                        &lt;ItemsPresenter /&gt;\n                    &lt;/Expander.Content&gt;\n                &lt;/Expander&gt;\n            &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;\n    &lt;/Setter&gt;\n&lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any advice would be really appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","visual-studio-2010","windows-8","gesture","windows-7-x64"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12976156,"title":"C# GestureRecognizer: requirements and getting started","body":"<p>I want to use GestureRecognizer in order to recognize gestures.

While I do have unmanaged debugging enabled, there is no exception thrown and I do not know what is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I can tell this problem happens more frequently as the graph gets more and more pins.

So an Objects name containing the letter B but not A are accepted, when they shouldnt be.</p>\n\n<p>My current solution to this problem has been creating a \"Master\" filter function that has every filter function inside of it and I run every Object through every filter and if the object makes it through ALL of the filters then it is accepted. This does work but my code is getting crazy now and logic is getting out of control. Does anyone know how to apply a new filter function on the result of the last filter for a CVS? Why doesn't the CVS just do this automatically instead of sending every Object through every filter or am I not thinking about CVS in the right way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","menu","menuitem","submenu"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":12961461,"title":"I made a menu style in xaml, but how can i do to put the submenu of subitens in the right direction?","body":"<p>Here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Style TargetType=\"{x:Type MenuItem}\"&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Template\"&gt;\n        &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n            &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type MenuItem}\"&gt;\n\n                &lt;Border Name=\"Border\" &gt;\n                    &lt;Grid&gt;\n                        &lt;ContentPresenter Margin=\"6,3,10,3\" ContentSource=\"Header\" RecognizesAccessKey=\"True\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;Popup  Width=\"auto\" AllowsTransparency=\"True\" Name=\"Popup\" Placement=\"Bottom\" IsOpen=\"{TemplateBinding IsSubmenuOpen}\" Focusable=\"False\" PopupAnimation=\"Fade\"&gt;\n                            &lt;Border Opacity=\"1\" Name=\"SubmenuBorder\" SnapsToDevicePixels=\"True\" &gt;\n                                &lt;Border.Background&gt;\n                                    &lt;SolidColorBrush Color=\"#FF9FD3F3\"/&gt;\n                                &lt;/Border.Background&gt;\n                                &lt;StackPanel  IsItemsHost=\"True\" KeyboardNavigation.DirectionalNavigation=\"Cycle\" /&gt;\n                                &lt;Border.BorderBrush&gt;\n                                    &lt;SolidColorBrush Color=\"Pink\"&gt;&lt;/SolidColorBrush&gt;\n                                &lt;/Border.BorderBrush&gt;\n                                &lt;Border.BorderThickness&gt;\n                                    &lt;Thickness Bottom=\"3\" Top=\"3\" Left=\"3\" Right=\"3\" &gt;&lt;/Thickness&gt;\n                                &lt;/Border.BorderThickness&gt;\n                            &lt;/Border&gt;\n                        &lt;/Popup&gt;\n                    &lt;/Grid&gt;\n\n                &lt;/Border&gt;\n                &lt;ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;\n                    &lt;Trigger Property=\"IsSuspendingPopupAnimation\" Value=\"True\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Setter TargetName=\"Popup\" Property=\"PopupAnimation\" Value=\"Fade\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/Trigger&gt;\n\n                    &lt;Trigger Property=\"IsMouseOver\" Value=\"True\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Setter Property=\"Effect\" Value=\"{StaticResource dropShadow}\"/&gt;\n                        &lt;Setter TargetName=\"Border\" Property=\"Background\" Value=\"#f9cef9\"/&gt;\n\n                    &lt;/Trigger&gt;                      \n\n\n                    **&lt;Trigger SourceName=\"Popup\" Property=\"Popup.AllowsTransparency\" Value=\"True\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Setter TargetName=\"SubmenuBorder\" Property=\"Padding\" Value=\"10,0,0,3\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/Trigger&gt;**\n\n\n\n\n                &lt;/ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;\n            &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;\n    &lt;/Setter&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I put the direction on the right side?\nIt's a horizontal menu, when I click the submenus dropdown, that's right, but I have a subitem with submenus and I wanna them open in the right direction not dropdown </p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","mvvm","binding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12959691,"title":"WPF binding And DataContext","body":"<p>I have a situation where my view has a DataContext bound to the ViewModel but one of my controls inside the view has its DataContext Set to a property of the ViewModel.

The application doesn't run in fullscreen mode, but in a maximized window. This is very smooth and fast.</p>\n\n<p>The second application consists of a WPF window that renders a <code>ScatterView</code> with some images.

The general idea here is that the WPF window should look like it is composited on top of the 3D scene.</p>\n\n<p>However, as soon as the D3D10 application is running, the performance of the WPF app deteriorates to as low as 1-2 fps (as measured by the WPF Performance Tool). That's not because my computer hardware is not capable of rendering both applications: the D3D10 app is always rendering the 3D scene very smoothly, and GPU and CPU utilization does not max out when I have both applications running. Even when I give the WPF app a higher process priority, the rendering performance stays at 1-2 fps.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tried to combine both applications into a single process and using a <code>D3DImage</code> and using a shared D3D10 surface (with a D3D9Ex device) to feed it into the <code>D3DImage</code>.

All of those solutions work and produce a D3D10 scene with some WPF controls on top of it, but none of them make WPF run smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of using two different application processes was my final idea to decouple the WPF rendering stack from any eventual performance impacts that may arise from having D3D10 render in the same process.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":31,"score":-2,"question_id":12958085,"title":"Acrobat Exception WPF","body":"<p>I am displaying an PDF in my WPF application.

Can I not make <code>_evtLog</code> Observable without populating one from the other?</p>\n\n<p>Can I restrict these lists to X events based on the date of the event?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","xaml","mvvm"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":82,"score":0,"question_id":12953064,"title":"Displaying WPF ProgressBar window in separate thread","body":"<p>I would like to display a simple WPF Window with an <code>Indeterminate=\"True\"</code> progress bar when running time consuming tasks.</p>\n\n<p>I've implemented my solution following <a href=\"http://reedcopsey.com/2011/11/28/launching-a-wpf-window-in-a-separate-thread-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> example by - Reed Copsey.</p>\n\n<p>Once the process is complete I need to close the Window.\nMy guess was that to achieve this I would either need to kill the thread or close the view(window).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately both ways give me the following errors:</p>\n\n<p>1)Calling <code>Abort()</code> on a thread:</p>\n\n<p>The window is closed, which is correct, but I'm still getting the following error:</p>\n\n<p>Unable to evaluate expression because the code is optimized or a native frame is on top of the call stack</p>\n\n<p>2)<code>View.Close()</code>:</p>\n\n<p>The calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it.</p>\n\n<p>The required logic needs to be implemented in the <code>StopThread()</code> method, any idea what I could do to elegantly close the Window:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Presentation.Commands;\n\nnamespace ProgressBar\n{\n    public class ProgressBarViewModel\n    {\n        public DelegateCommand&lt;object&gt; CloseCommand { get; set; }\n        Thread newWindowThread;\n\n        string _closeButton;\n        public string CloseButton \n        {\n            get { return _closeButton; }\n            set { _closeButton = value; }\n        }\n\n        ProgressBarView _view;\n        public ProgressBarView View\n        {\n            get { return _view; }\n            set { _view = value; }\n        }\n\n        public ProgressBarViewModel(ProgressBarView view)\n        {\n                CloseButton = \"Close\";\n                CloseCommand = new DelegateCommand&lt;object&gt;(CloseForm);\n\n                View = view;\n                View.Closing +=new System.ComponentModel.CancelEventHandler(View_Closing);\n                View.DataContext = this;\n        }\n\n        public void View_Closing(object sender,CancelEventArgs e)\n        {\n            StopThread();\n        }\n\n        public void CloseForm(object p)\n        {\n            StopThread();\n        }\n\n        private void StopThread()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                //View.Close();\n                newWindowThread.Abort();\n            }\n            catch (Exception eX)\n            {\n                Debugger.Break();\n                //Getting an error when attempting to end the thread:\n                //Unable to evaluate expression because the code is optimized or a native frame is on top of the call stack\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void ShowProgress()\n        {\n                newWindowThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(() =&gt;\n                {\n                    ProgressBarView tempWindow = new ProgressBarView();\n                    tempWindow.DataContext = this;\n                    tempWindow.Show();\n                    System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Run();\n                }));\n\n                newWindowThread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);\n                newWindowThread.IsBackground = true;\n                newWindowThread.Start();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","mvvm","binding","viewmodel"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":12952871,"title":"Binding a variable inside a viewmodel to a different variable in another viewmodel","body":"<p>I'm implementing a WPF application using the MVVM pattern.</p>\n\n<p>The application is basically a communications panel (comms panel) with control widgets laid on top of it (e.g., dial pads, intercom lines, etc).

Setting the owner to null in the OnClosed event does also not help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simple Solution found</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you experience the same problem as I have described, put the following code in the OnClosing of all child windows.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void  OnClosing(System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e)\n  base.OnClosing(e);\n  if (null != Owner) {\n         Owner.Activate();\n  }\n  // ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can be followed by any further processing logic, even opening MessageBoxes is tolerated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example-Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>The issue seems to be much bigger as I thought. The following example will remove focus of the parent window if the message box will be opened and the the child window will be closed (Copy the code into a loaded event-handler of a Window).</p>\n\n<pre><code>Window firstChildWindow = new Window() {\n    Title = \"Floating Window\", Width = 100, Height = 70\n};\nfirstChildWindow.Owner = Window.GetWindow(this);\n\nButton button = new Button() { Content=\"MessageBox\"};\nbutton.Click += delegate { \n    MessageBox.Show(\"Klicking her breaks the focus-chain.\"); };\nfirstChildWindow.Content = button;\nfirstChildWindow.Show();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this example breaks the focus-chain:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Window firstChildWindow = new Window() {\n    Title = \"Floating Window\", Width = 100, Height = 70\n};\nfirstChildWindow.Owner = Window.GetWindow(this);\nfirstChildWindow.Show();\n\nWindow secondChildWindow = new Window() { \n    Title=\"Second Window\",Width=100,Height=70};\nsecondChildWindow.Content = new TextBlock() { \n    Text=\"SecondWindow\"};\nsecondChildWindow.Owner = firstChildWindow;\nsecondChildWindow.Show();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Has someone a resolution for this problem. I think about a hack to trigger giving focus to the parent after closing, with Dispatcher or DispachterTimer or perhaps it would be work to manualy force focus to the parent on closed but this all seems to me very unclean (and is also a little complicated if there are more active owned windows of the same parent, as I have in my current app). </p>\n\n<p>No one knows a neat solution to this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window.owner.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN Description</a> (see under remarks for non modal windows opened calling Show())</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/wpf/thread/a51ac7b9-7021-4669-accd-af0e86b9cc01\" rel=\"nofollow\">Same problem on msdn forums without appropriate solution</a></p>\n\n<p>Please see also: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3234581/instable-focus-of-wpf-apps\">Instable focus of WPF apps</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wpf",".net-4.0"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":2,"question_id":12951345,"title":"How to use a .NET 4.0 application on .NET 4.5?","body":"<p>I'm the end-user of a program that relies on WPF from .NET 4.0.

It works but a soon as I set StaysOpen as FALSE once the timer is hit, the pop up closes on its own.</li>\n<li>Without all these workarounds, if a user quickly clicks (leftclick) on the window before it disappears, the pop up sticks so I tried few ways to simulate the mouse click on the popup as it opens up but that doesn't cut it either. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","mvvm","drag-and-drop","adorner","diagramming"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1516,"score":4,"question_id":6361857,"title":"Drawing diagram arcs with drag and drop in WPF","body":"<p>I'm trying to perform a <strong>drag and drop approach to creating relationships in a diagram</strong>, directly analagous to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Management_Studio\" rel=\"nofollow\">SQL Server Management Studio</a> diagramming tools.

Some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language\" rel=\"nofollow\">XAML</a> relating to the overall diagram:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=\"{Binding Items, Mode=OneWay}\"&gt;\n    &lt;ItemsControl.ItemsPanel&gt;\n        &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;\n            &lt;lib:DesignerCanvas VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing=\"True\" VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode=\"Recycling\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;\n    &lt;/ItemsControl.ItemsPanel&gt;\n    &lt;ItemsControl.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n        &lt;Style&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Canvas.Left\" Value=\"{Binding X}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Canvas.Top\" Value=\"{Binding Y}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Canvas.Width\" Value=\"{Binding Width}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Canvas.Height\" Value=\"{Binding Height}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Canvas.ZIndex\" Value=\"{Binding ZIndex}\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/Style&gt;\n    &lt;/ItemsControl.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n&lt;/ItemsControl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and <code>DataTemplate</code>s for the entites and relationships:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- diagram relationship --&gt;\n&lt;DataTemplate DataType=\"{x:Type dvm:DiagramRelationshipViewModel}\"&gt;\n    &lt;lib:Connection /&gt;\n&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n&lt;!-- diagram entity --&gt;\n&lt;DataTemplate DataType=\"{x:Type dvm:DiagramEntityViewModel}\"&gt;\n    &lt;lib:DesignerItem&gt;\n        &lt;lib:EntityDiagramControl /&gt;\n    &lt;/lib:DesignerItem&gt;\n&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The issue is that once the drag operation begins, mouse moves are no longer tracked and the connector adorner is unable to draw the arc as it does in other contexts. If I release the mouse and click again, then the arc starts drawing, but then I've lost my source object.  I'm trying to figure a way to pass the source object in conjunction with mouse movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bounty:</strong> Circling back to this issue, I currently plan to not use drag and drop directly to do this. I currently plan to add a DragItem and IsDragging <code>DependencyProperty</code> for the diagram control, which would hold the item being dragged, and flag if a drag operation is occuring. I could then use <code>DataTrigger</code>s to change the <code>Cursor</code> and <code>Adorner</code> visibility based on IsDragging, and could use DragItem for the drop operation.</p>\n\n<p>(But, I'm looking to award a bounty on another interesting approach. Please comment if more information or code is needed to clarify this question.)</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","wpf","xaml","event-handling","inkcanvas"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":2,"question_id":12943387,"title":"How do I make a transparent WPF window stay on top of all other windows, but have no affect on user input?","body":"<p>I am trying to develop a Windows application that allows people to \"draw on their screen.\"</p>\n\n<p>I’m developing with:</p>\n\n<p>.NET 3.5\nC#/WPF </p>\n\n<p>I have a WPF Window that hosts an InkCanvas, both having transparent backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Window XAML properties:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ShowInTaskbar=\"True\" ResizeMode=\"NoResize\" Background=\"Transparent\"\nWindowStyle=\"None\" AllowsTransparency=\"True\" Topmost=\"True\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>InkCanvas properties:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Background=\"#11FFFFFF\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need an event handler for the following:\n- right click anywhere in window\n- press escape</p>\n\n<p>desired result:\n- WPF window remains on top of all other windows, but is no longer active and no longer accepts input\n- WPF window can longer be focused on.

Now the strangest thing happens... let me explain.</p>\n\n<p>I have four preset styles and individually, they all work just fine. Three of them use the two BorderInnerBrush and BorderOuterBrush properties and one uses the shortcut BorderBrush property. I can switch between the styles using a ContextMenu and some code behind that accesses the xaml styles from Resources and sets them to the ClockFace object's Style property.</p>\n\n<p>I can switch between the three styles that don't use the shortcut property endlessly without problem. I can also switch to the style that does use the shortcut property and it appears just fine. This is when the strangeness begins.</p>\n\n<p>After switching to the style that uses the BorderBrush property, the BorderInnerBrush and BorderOuterBrush properties simply stop working. The preset Brush objects set in the various styles no longer get set on the two Ellipse objects. I pluged in some PropertyChangedCallback methods to the inner and outer border properties to see what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>When I first run the application, I can switch to the three styles that don't use the shortcut property without problem. I put breakpoints on all three border Brush properties' PropertyChangedCallback methods and debugged the program. When switching to each of these three styles, the inner and outer border properties' callback methods' breakpoints were hit as you would expect. When switching to the style that uses the BorderBrush property, its callback method's breakpoint was hit. The SetBorderBrushes method sets the two other border Brush objects so the inner and outer border properties' callback methods' breakpoints were then hit as you would expect.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is the weird part. When switching to any of the other three styles after this, the inner and outer border properties' callback methods' breakpoints are no longer hit at all. Instead, the breakpoint in the callback method attached to the BorderBrush property is hit an the value of e.NewValue is null. As null values are ignored in the SetBorderBrushes method, no further breakpoints are hit.</p>\n\n<p>After further investigation, I discovered that the e.NewValue was null because there was no default value set on the BorderBrushProperty DependencyProperty. Indeed, after adding a default Brush object to the declaration, this is the Brush that would be passed in e.NewValue in the callback method. Although the breakpoints in the two inner and outer border properties' callback methods would get hit after this, it was only because they are set in the SetBorderBrushes method. The Brush objects set in the BorderInnerBrush and BorderOuterBrush objects in the styles never get passed to these properties after the BorderBrush property has been used once.</p>\n\n<p>One final point to note is that just as the default value of the BorderBrushProperty property is set when a value is not explicitly set in a style, the default values of the inner and outer border DependencyProperty objects are also set when their values are not explicitly set in a style, but only when the BorderBrush property is not also set in the style. </p>\n\n<p>I've been stuck on this for days now and although an easy solution would be to remove the shortcut property, I'd rather find out what's going on and fix it. I hope I've provided enough information for some bright spark to be able to solve this problem, so, if you have any ideas or questions, please share them. Many thanks.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE >></p>\n\n<p>Following Rick's suggestion,  I created another pair of Brush properties and set them from the callback methods attached to the other three Brush properties. Using this setup, I could switch between all of the styles without any visual problems... or so I thought.</p>\n\n<p>I can now switch from the style that uses the BorderBrush (shortcut) property to the styles that set the two BorderInner and BorderOuter properties and the borders update correctly, so thanks Rick for getting me one step closer. I still have a problem when switching from the style that sets the BorderBrush property to the style that does not explicitly set any border Brush.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I still have the same problem that the BorderInnerBrush and BorderOuterBrush properties don't work directly after being set from code behind. What's new is that if I then switch to a style that sets the two Brush properties, this seems to 'wake them up' again... if I then switch to the style that sets no border Brush, the inner and outer properties set their default values correctly again.</p>\n\n<p>It's only after using a style that sets the two border properties from code behind that they become dead to being set in styles or using their default values. This is so strange... can anyone work it out?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2 >>></p>\n\n<p>First, thanks so much for your time and example Rick. After copying and pasting Rick's example code into a new project, I had to make a few alterations before it would run... maybe because I don't have Expression Blend 4? I installed the SDK and added the references to the noted dlls, but had to use the following XML namespace declarations instead:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xmlns:i=\"clr-namespace:System.Windows.Interactivity;assembly=System.Windows.Interactivity\"\nxmlns:ei=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Expression.Interactivity.Core;assembly=Microsoft.Expression.Interactions\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also had to change each ChangePropertyAction declaration slightly to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ei:ChangePropertyAction TargetName=\"clock\" PropertyName=\"Style\" Value=\"{StaticResource styleBrush}\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, it worked fine for me and is a good representation of that portion of my actual ClockFace control, with two exceptions. The first is that my styles are switched from code behind via an event handler - this is clearly not causing my problem. The second difference is that I have set default Brush values on my versions of ActualOuterBrush and ActualInnerBrush, so that users of the control don't have to supply border brushes.</p>\n\n<p>So my final problem is that the default inner and outer border brushes do not get set in a Style with no border properties explicitly set after the BorderBrush property has been set in a Style. Remember, the default values do get set up until this point. So, I experimented with Rick's example and added some default values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static readonly DependencyPropertyKey ActualInnerBrushPropertyKey = DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly(\"ActualInnerBrush\", typeof(Brush), typeof(Clock), new UIPropertyMetadata(Brushes.Teal));\n\nprivate static readonly DependencyPropertyKey ActualOuterBrushPropertyKey = DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly(\"ActualOuterBrush\", typeof(Brush), typeof(Clock), new UIPropertyMetadata(Brushes.Salmon));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now this project has a similar problem... the default values are never reset.

What I want to achieve is a scrollbar with draggable endpoints. Example of these kinds of scrollbars are in the After Effects video editing software by Adobe.</p>\n\n<p>Basic functionality of such a scrollbar is that it is able to scroll trough content that is bigger then it's container, but both the left and right endpoint can be dragged to dynamically change the scale of the content. </p>\n\n<p>I have implemented a similar scrollbar in the plotting program; users should be able to drag around the in and outpoint (Rectangles in a canvas), and the plot canvas should respond to this by scaling to the desired range.\nInformation I need for this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Width of the total plot (amount of plotpoints)</li>\n<li>Width of the container (static, 600px)</li>\n<li>Percentage of the in and out points relative to the total width of the scrollbar canvas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/56mjG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to current screenshot</a></p>\n\n<p>With this information I have created a MatrixTransform, using the ScaleAt() method to scale the plot canvas inside the container so that it matches the in and outpoints in the scrollbar below. For this I used the following code. resetTransform gets called <em>FPS</em> times a second to keep up with the incoming data and XMAX and YMAX are updated elsewhere to reflect this.\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void resetTransform(Boolean useSlider = false)\n{\n    //Add transformgroup to plot\n    double yscale = plot.Height / view.YMAX; //YMAX is maximum plot value received\n    double xscale = plot.Width / view.XMAX; //XMAX is total ammount of plotted points\n    Matrix m = new Matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);\n    if (useSlider)\n    {\n        double maxVal = zoomBar.ActualWidth - outPoint.Width;\n        double outP = Canvas.GetLeft(outPoint); //points position relative to the scrollbar\n        double inP = Canvas.GetLeft(inPoint);\n        double center = (((outP + inP) / 2) / maxVal) * plot.ActualWidth;\n        double delta = (outP-inP);\n        double factor = (maxVal/delta) * xscale;\n        double mappedinP = (inP / maxVal) * view.XMAX;\n\n        double anchorOut = (outP / maxVal) * view.XMAX;\n        double anchorIn = (inP / maxVal) * view.XMAX;\n\n        m.ScaleAt(factor, -yscale,center,0); //scale around the center point, \n        m.Translate(0, plot.Height); //to compensate the flipped graph, move it back down\n    }\n    scale = new ScaleTransform(m.M11, m.M22, 0, 0); //save scale factors in a scaletransform for reference\n    signals.scaleSignalStrokes(scale); //Scale the plotlines to compensate for canvas scaling\n    MatrixTransform matrixTrans = new MatrixTransform(m); //Create matrixtransform\n    plot.RenderTransform = matrixTrans; //Apply to canvas\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Expectation: Everything should work and the plotted graph would scale nicely when the amount of plotpoints grows over time. Reality: The graph scales when moving the points around, but it is not representative; Moreover, the more plot points are added, the more the whole canvas shifts to the right and the less control I seem to have over the transformation. The algorithm as it is now is probably to wrong approach to get the result I need, but I have spent quite some time thinking how to do this right. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have uploaded a video to give a clearer picture on the interaction. In the video you can clearly see the canvas shifting to the right.\n<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7668847/screencap.avi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Screencapture video</a></p>\n\n<p>How should I scale the canvas (plot) to fit within two boundaries? </p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","memory-leaks"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":165,"score":0,"question_id":10803891,"title":"window closed event doesn't release memory and resource.

That's just a preliminary idea that I got out of the same bug in other app...</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","xaml","user-interface"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":12915920,"title":"UserControl Expand Vertically when Window is expanded","body":"<p>I'm having trouble getting my UserControl to expand vertically when my window is expanded.</p>\n\n<p>My UserControl currently sits inside a ItemsControl which is stretching correctly by setting the VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\" property on the ItemsControl.</p>\n\n<p>I add the following UserControl to the ItemsControl:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;UserControl MinWidth=\"930\"&gt;\n     &lt;Grid VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Background=\"Red\"&gt;\n          &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n               &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"200\" /&gt;\n               &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"730*\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n          &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n               &lt;RowDefinition Height=\"400\" /&gt;\n               &lt;RowDefinition Height=\"*\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n\n          &lt;DockPanel Grid.Column=\"1\" Grid.ColumnSpan=\"1\" Grid.RowSpan=\"2\" Grid.Row=\"0\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Background=\"Pink\" LastChildFill=\"True\"&gt;\n\n              &lt;ItemsControl Name=\"itemPanelOverview\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Background=\"Black\" Margin=\"0\"/&gt;\n         &lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n     &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&lt;/UserControl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The UserControl is called in an ItemsControl inside of a TabControl like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;TabItem&gt;\n     &lt;TabItem.Header&gt;\n          HEADER EG\n     &lt;/TabItem.Header&gt;\n\n     &lt;ItemsControl Name=\"contentItems\" Grid.ColumnSpan=\"2\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Grid.Row=\"1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Background=\"Blue\"&gt;\n          &lt;Grid Height=\"35\" Background=\"{DynamicResource GrayMenuGradient}\" &gt;\n               &lt;Image Source=\"...\" Stretch=\"None\" /&gt;\n               &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding WelcomeMessage}\" /&gt;\n          &lt;/Grid&gt;\n    &lt;/ItemsControl&gt;\n&lt;/TabItem&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It appears that the ItemsControl (contentItems) is stretching as expected, as I can see the blue background stretching correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't set the height for this UserControl anywhere other than the Row Definitions.
