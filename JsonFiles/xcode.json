I just request that if you decide to lay out code or a code example to tell me where to put the code (ex: place this code in a new .h file and then link this code to the .m file)</p>\n\n<p>and an example project would be the most helpful! thanks!

drawing on BitmapContext in landscape orientation with XCode 4.5 / iOS / Quartz 2D","body":"<p>i would like to do some paintings with Quartz 2D with an app on my iPhone and encounter problems with a view in landscape mode. The app is designed for landscape mode only(Supported Interface Orientations: Landscape Left). </p>\n\n<p>When i create a new View Controller in Interface Builder, there is existing a default view already. My painting view is one level below this default view and has a custom class(subclass of UIView), where i override drawRect to paint my stuff and create a BitmapContext for offscreen-rendering. My custom class is connected with the ViewController via IBOutlet, so i can control the painting stuff from within the ViewController.m file.\nIf i assign my custom class to the default view and create the Project in Portrait mode(with coordinates for portrait mode), everything is painted fine. But if i set the Interface Orientation to Landscape, the (Landscape mode-)coordinates seems to be parsed wrong and the painting is randomly inside or outside of the visible area.\nWhile using the default view for my custom class, i could fix the problem temporarily by swapping the x and y coordinates when i create the BitmapContext in testPoint and creating the CGRect inside drawRect. But when my view is one level below the default view, swapping the coordinates no longer does the trick and the view with the custom class seems to be distorted.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to be a problem with my BitmapContext or the way i do the painting in drawRect, because if i render dots directly into the current Context, the dots are displayed properly.\nIn my app there should be several different views with transparency, Background-Images and a special order. I need to paint above the view with the background image for example, so i think i need the tree structure with several views inside the default view.</p>\n\n<p>Here is some code from my custom class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {\nCGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\nCGImageRef cgImage = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(drawingContext);\nCGContextClipToRect(context, rect);\nCGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height), cgImage);\nCGImageRelease(cgImage);}\n\n- (void)testPoint {\nCGSize screenSize = [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame].size;\nCGColorSpaceRef colorSpaceRef = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();\ndrawingContext = CGBitmapContextCreate (nil, screenSize.width, screenSize.height, 8, 4*(int)screenSize.width, colorSpaceRef, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast);\nUIColor *color = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.0 blue:1.0 alpha:1.0];\nCGContextSetFillColorWithColor(drawingContext, [color CGColor]);\nCGContextSetLineCap(drawingContext, kCGLineCapRound);\nCGRect dot = CGRectMake(430, 250, 50, 50);\nCGContextFillEllipseInRect (drawingContext, dot);\n[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:dot];}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,\nDaniel</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","undefined-symbol"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6,"score":1,"question_id":13279430,"title":"LibEtPan / iOS: Symbol(s) not found …","body":"<p>I tried to use LibEtPan as a backend for a mail client.

To this end, I put shared code in a static library project, referenced by the new derivative apps. </p>\n\n<p>Now this static library should contain a set of Core Data related files, that are used by all white-labeled projects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A managed object model, compiled into a <code>model.mom</code></li>\n<li>A read-only sqlite store, generated earlier as sqlite-store.db</li>\n<li>A set of NSManagedObject subclasses, generated by <a href=\"http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mogenerator</a> based on the <code>model.xcdatamodel(d)</code> package/file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Custom Bundle</h3>\n\n<p>Static libraries can't contain anything but compiled code, so in order to pass around the .mom and .db files, I add a new bundle target (following <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711586/core-data-in-a-static-library-for-the-iphone\">examples here on stackoverflow</a> and from other online resources like <a href=\"http://www.galloway.me.uk/tutorials/ios-library-with-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matt Galloway</a> and <a href=\"http://nachbaur.com/blog/smarter-core-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Nachbauer</a>). This bundle target compiles the model.xcdatamodel(d) into the model.mom file and copies the sqlite-store.db. This works and I have access to the bundle when running the main app.</p>\n\n<h3>Problem</h3>\n\n<p>The Mogenerator classes contain some extra methods needed to use the data, compiled into the static library. One example class would be <code>CDNode</code> extending <code>_CDNode</code> extending <code>NSManagedObject</code> and the custom method I added is <code>-(CGRect)frame</code>. Xcode is fine with these files, shown by correctly autocompleting the <code>frame</code> method and compiling without any warnings.</p>\n\n<p>However when the <code>frame</code> method is called on a <code>CDNode</code> instance called <code>node</code>, LLDB throws an exception with the following description:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-[NSManagedObject frame]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xea8ef50\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When running <code>po node</code> in the console, the printout looks fine. The object <strong>is</strong> a CDNode instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(CDNode *) $1 = 0x0ea8ef50 &lt;NSManagedObject: 0xea8ef50&gt; (entity: CDNode; id: 0xea630c0 &lt;x-coredata://C5ECBF02-768D-4961-9E03-C62A9850964B/ZPSpace/p2358&gt; ; data: &lt;fault&gt;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This output had me doubting \"isn't this a CDNode class then?\", but the <code>(CDNode *)</code> at the start is an artefact of it's variable type, not the actual object's class. Running <code>po [node class]</code> shows it is in fact just a 'plain' NSManagedObject:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(id) $2 = 0x0ea8ef50 NSManagedObject\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Suspect</h3>\n\n<p>I think the compiler can't find the class (header) files when compiling the .xcdatamodel(d) to the .mom(d). If I add the mogenerator classes and the <code>model.xcdatamodeld</code> package to the top level project directly, taking the static library out of the equation, the app runs fine and passes the <code>frame</code>-call. </p>\n\n<h3>Question</h3>\n\n<p>How do I get the xcdatamodeld to accept the classes that belong to it?</p>\n\n<p><em>Alternative solutions are much appreciated too!</em></p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","core-data","variable-types"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13277532,"title":"How can I tell if a CoreData Attribute is an integer type or a float type?","body":"<p>I have an app that stores some numerical values in a CoreData Entity.

Traditionally, we compiled the code we needed into a .dll and called that .dll when we needed a calculation done. We are now trying to create an iPad app, which unfortunately means we can't just call a .dll anymore. </p>\n\n<p>One of my coworkers have managed to make a simple Command Line Tool project, where we call a Fortran file to write \"Hello, World\" in the debugger.  However, when I try to get it to work on view based iPad app, I get a bunch of linker errors saying the symbols I'm using cannot be found.  I know that the Command Line Tool uses a .cpp file to actually run the Fortran, and I've seen many threads concerning calling .cpp files in an app, but all the ones I've seen are outdated, directly contradict each other, and their fixes don't work for me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a more direct way to call Fortran straight from a .m file?  If not, what do I have to do to take the working Command Line Tool and get it into an app?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 1: following the tutorials posted in the comments, I have been able to create a .o file from my Fortran code.  I can do a File-Add Files to add it in easily enough, but now how do I actually call it?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: Okay, baby steps.  I found out you can make a .a static library (I'll call it \"new_library\") from .o files (\"source_file.o\") using the Terminal command <code>ar crv new_library.a source_file.o</code> (you can do it for multiple .o files by just adding <code>source_file2.o source_file3.o</code> for as many .o files as you want - NOTE: make sure you use <code>cd</code> to get to the folder where the .o files are located).  I'm pretty sure Xcode will work with .a files, but it seems a .h file is still needed to let the other files in the project (like the view controllers) make calls to what's in the .a file. I know I can make a new .a file from Xcode itself (New Project -> iOS -> Framework &amp; Library -> Cocoa Touch Static Library), but when I've done it that way in the past, I just write normal .m and .h files, and when I build the new library it just mashes all the .m files into 1 .a.  When I want to use the code in that .a in another project, I just import the .a and all the .h files into the new project, and I can call the methods in the .a file just as if I had imported all the separate .m files.  So the next question is, do I still need a .h when my .a is made with the terminal instead of Xcode?  If so, how would I make a Fortran header file?  If not, how do I call my Fortran code in the .a?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","osx","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13274955,"title":"Changing reference to different object without changing initially referenced object?","body":"<p>I'm currently trying to write an XML-parser with the help of NSXMLParser.

The line in my code that is indicated is just the call to UIApplicationMain() in main.m which does not help me much.</p>\n\n<p>The app is just 3 views. Main, Detail and About. It looks like MainView or MainViewController contains the problem. I conclude from the app not crashing when I: 1.Choose to not add it to the NavigationController at launch. 2.Choose to add the AboutController instead.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the problem is the Xib file rather than the controller or view code because I can init the MainViewController with the AboutView Xib and have the app launch. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder if I can \"fix\" this Xib or if I have to create a new one and re-layout the GUI elements? Which is my only way forward I fear. The app mis simple but it would still take some time to re-layout the main (and most dense) view. ALso IO would prefer to know what the problem is rather than just starting over and possibly ending up in the same situation again one day.</p>\n\n<p>Am I at all on the right track? Is there a way to track down the offending code or GUI widget?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","osx","nstableview","nib"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":803,"score":3,"question_id":8371482,"title":"XCode Developer API - Object Library - Objects Disappearing","body":"<p>Fairly new to the Xcode Developer API and need a little help.

Thanks to some great questions here, I was able to resolve that issue by having the initial navController return the individual topViewController's preference for shouldAutorotate via: </p>\n\n<pre><code>    - (BOOL)shouldAutorotate\n{\n    return  self.topViewController.shouldAutorotate;\n}\n\n-(NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations\n{\n    return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAll;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I have stumbled onto a new problem.  the root vc (viewController A) should NOT autorotate and should only support portrait.  ViewController B in the nav stack supports portrait and landscape.  If I am in viewController B, and am in landscape, and touch \"back\" to pop the view back to viewController A... vc A loads in landscape, which it is not supposed to even support, and wont rotate back to portrait because shouldAutorotate for vc A is set to NO...   </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated.

I was incorrectly (obviously) under the impression that a Pan would do the slide in effect.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your help!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","cocos2d"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11,"score":1,"question_id":13258379,"title":"cocos2d 2.0 App craches on device but not in simulator","body":"<p>My app craches on my device, but not in my simulator</p>\n\n<p>I am using cocos2d 2.0\nI have macbook air 2011 osx 10.8.2\nMy device is iPad 2 ios 6.0.1</p>\n\n<p>It happends in b2math.h, in the line under</p>\n\n<pre><code>void Set(float32 x_, float32 y_) { x = x_; y = y_; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It crashes on launch</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","device","selected"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13257944,"title":"Xcode cannot run using the selected device","body":"<p>Xcode cannot run using the selected device.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","filemerge"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":10,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":161,"score":9,"question_id":12617644,"title":"Unable to load platform at path","body":"<p>when use filemerge to solve hg conflict, I got this error</p>\n\n<pre><code>FileMerge[18002:707] Unable to load platform at path\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","mapkit"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13252776,"title":"use of undeclared identifier MapKit","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8578221/opencv-ios-mapkit-conflict\">OpenCv - iOS MapKit conflict</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm having a problem getting my project to compile.

(This is assuming I'm writing a generic class and don't want to impose restrictions on the max number of simultaneous touches).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a more elegant way to solve this that I'm missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode","ios6","uisearchbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13105367,"title":"the search bar in Xcode 5 crashes when i type something","body":"<p>the search bar in Xcode 4.5.1 crashes when i type something, and it worked just fine when i was using Xcode 4.4\nplease help</p>\n\n<p>i used this code which was an answer for another question, and it worked just fine when i was using Xcode 4/4, until i updated it to 4.5.1</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) searchBarSearchButtonClicked:(UISearchBar *)theSearchBar{\n\n//Perform the JSON query.\n\n[self searchCoordinatesForAddress:[theSearchBar text]];\n\n//Hide the keyboard.\n[theSearchBar resignFirstResponder];}\n\n-(void) searchCoordinatesForAddress:(NSString *)inAddress{\n\nNSMutableString *urlString = [NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@\"http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=%@&amp;output=json\",inAddress];\n\n//Replace Spaces with a '+' character.\n[urlString setString:[urlString stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@\" \" withString:@\"+\"]];\n\nNSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];\n\n//Setup and start an async download.\n//Note that we should test for reachability!.\nNSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url];\nNSURLConnection *connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self];\n\n}\n\n- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data{\n\nNSString *jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\n\nNSError *error;\nNSData *jsonData = [jsonString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\nNSDictionary *results = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:jsonData options:0 error:&amp;error];\n\nNSArray *placemark  = [results objectForKey:@\"Placemark\"];\nNSArray *coordinates = [[placemark objectAtIndex:0] valueForKeyPath:@\"Point.coordinates\"];\n\ndouble longitude = [[coordinates objectAtIndex:0] doubleValue];\ndouble latitude = [[coordinates objectAtIndex:1] doubleValue];\n\n\n\n[self zoomMapAndCenterAtLatitude:latitude andLongitude:longitude];}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ios6","unity","xcode4.5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13250986,"title":"XCode 4.5 - Undefined symbols for architecture armv7","body":"<p>I'm brand new to iOS development, and I've been given the task of updating a legacy app to iOS6.

(e.g. Under \"Custom Objects\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've read the following, but I still can't get it to work (Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard) :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Adding Custom Objects to the Library</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Although you normally drag items out of the Library window and into\n  your user interface, you can also drag your custom configurations of\n  those objects back into the Library window. Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","localization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":22,"score":1,"question_id":13243793,"title":"localization and wrong keyboard for password field","body":"<p>I have a password text field (secured), and from some reason when I change the language of the OS, the english keyboard comes up for the password field only, rather than the keyboard for the selected language.

For example, the XML in the .storyboard file has its starting <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> tag's <code>toolsVersion</code> and <code>systemVersion</code> attributes altered by whatever configuration the most recent file manipulator happens to be running. Synchronizing everybody's Xcode versions precisely seems to help with <code>toolsVersion</code>, but <code>systemVersion</code> changes no matter what, depending on the specific Mac and/or OS X version the developer is running.</p>\n\n<p>This is idiotic, but mostly harmless. What worries us, though, is that at other times some other changes are automatically made to the storyboard just by opening them after a <code>git pull</code>. That is to say, Alice makes changes to a storyboard, commits and pushes them to the repository. Bob then pulls Alice's changes and opens up the storyboard to make further changes. The moment he opens the storyboard, the file icon immediately changes to a modified-but-unsaved state, and a <code>git status</code> shows that any number of weird changes have occurred. All this without Bob having changed anything or saved the file himself.</p>\n\n<p>The most common automated change we're seeing is the disappearance or reappearance of the entire <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> tag hierachy near the end of a storyboard file. We haven't figured out what is causing this. We may have several localized versions of a storyboard in various .lproj directories, and when opening them inside Interface Builder, the class hierarchy may spontaneously be removed from some and added into others, or left alone in some. This causes a lot of noise in <code>git diff</code>, but it doesn't actually break any functionality. We will often selectively add the actual changes we made into git's index, commit those, and then just discard the spontaneous, nonsensical <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> changes. This is to keep commits small and nice, as they should be. Eventually, though, it just becomes too much to bother with since Xcode keeps re-doing the changes, and someone just ragecommits them along with some other stuff... which is fine until someone else's Xcode decides to want to change them back for no apparent reason. (Our commit history has a lot of swearing over this.)</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else seeing this behaviour? Is this an Xcode bug or a configuration issue on one or more of our developer Macs? We've seen some similar behaviour when collaborating with XIB files, but storyboards seem more susceptible to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13245927,"title":"Xcode Error Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc failed with exit code 1","body":"<p>DataModelCompile /Users/maxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Pectopatop-axonkvxdjwugklfuanzpglrsyquj/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Pectopatop.app/XMPPRoster.mom Pectopatop/../../Libraries/XMPPFramework/Extensions/Roster/CoreDataStorage/XMPPRoster.xcdatamodel\n    cd /Users/maxxx/ios/Pectopatop\n    setenv PATH \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\n    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc -XD_MOMC_SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk -MOMC_PLATFORMS iphonesimulator -MOMC_PLATFORMS iphoneos /Users/maxxx/ios/Pectopatop/Pectopatop/../../Libraries/XMPPFramework/Extensions/Roster/CoreDataStorage/XMPPRoster.xcdatamodel /Users/maxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Pectopatop-axonkvxdjwugklfuanzpglrsyquj/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Pectopatop.app/XMPPRoster.mom</p>\n\n<p>Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc failed with exit code 1</p>\n\n<p>What is the problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","xcode"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":13245888,"title":"How to specify icons for a universal iPhone/iPad app?","body":"<p>How to specify icons for a universal iPhone/iPad app with all 4 versions (icon.png, icon@2x.png ... etc)??</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced </p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","ios6","audio-recording"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13246026,"title":"MPAVController >> Not enough buffered to keep up","body":"<p>I am playing video using this code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>player= [[ MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:movieURL];\nplayer.navigationController.navigationBar.hidden = YES;\nplayer.moviePlayer.scalingMode = MPMovieScalingModeAspectFit;\nplayer.moviePlayer.controlStyle = MPMovieControlStyleNone;\nplayer.moviePlayer.movieSourceType = MPMovieSourceTypeFile;\nplayer.moviePlayer.fullscreen = NO;\n[self presentModalViewController:player animated:NO];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Video playing works perfectly But the problem is that after finishing play i am getting this result in console.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[MPAVController] Autoplay: Likely to keep up or full buffer: 0\n[MPAVController] Autoplay: Skipping autoplay, not enough buffered to keep up.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then after i am trying to record the voice but unable to record.</p>\n\n<p>can anybody help me to solve this issue.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","code-signing","jailbreak"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":393,"score":2,"question_id":12768109,"title":"How to use ldid?","body":"<p>I am trying to run unsigned application on iOS 5.1/iPhone 4s (jailbroken).

I have this issue where I am using a class to store global information that is needed through out the code because it stores the list of food that a user adds to their meal plan. The issue that I have is that one it is a relatively large data structure that I am using. The data structure is a dictionary with keys to five other dictionaries that all have 8 mutable arrays that can be as large as the user wishes due to the fact that can add as much food as their heart desires.</p>\n\n<p>I have set the structure like so</p>\n\n<pre><code>mealInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]\n[mealInfo setObject:[NSMutableDictionary dictionary] forKey:\"foo\"];\n[[mealInfo objectForKey:\"such\"] setObject: [NSMutableArray array] forKey:\"bar\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is repeated for the complete data structure. This did seem to solve some of my possible memory leaks when I analyzed in xcode. The issue is further then that cause I have an idea what the issue is just not the solution. I have objects created, which create this structure in the local scope of the .m file I am in. I go save this structure in the class where mealInfo is created, not the local scope, with a static object of that class. (<em>I am not using too much code because it is one in a lot of locations and two is way too many lines</em>)</p>\n\n<p>After I save to the static variable of the class I release the local scope, I can not release the mealInfo because when I have done that in the past it actually causes the object to disappear and nil in the class that it was initialized in making it inaccessible to other classes trying to access this information. </p>\n\n<p>One solution I thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getters and setters, but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times. This I was trying to avoid. I will do that if that is the only solution, but would like to get this method to work first. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is not too confusing.

FYI... I have tried approaches 1 and 2, but I am not satisfied with the outcome from programming (and partly UX also) perspective(s).</p>\n\n<p>I have a table which has 2 sections. Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField. When the user presses <code>Edit</code> button (located on the <code>navigationBar</code>), the user can change the position of the cells, i.e. - s/he can move the cells from one section to another. Simple!</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been considering three approaches.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Include a <code>UIButton</code> object with each cell. The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach. Even worse, I will have to keep a track of the index where the cell should appear when it translates from one section to another.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have 8 cells in section 1 and 2. 4 cells of second section appear as hidden in the first section and vice versa. When the user presses + in one section A, its property should be set to hidden in section A and it should be made visible in section B. However, when the cell's property is set to hidden, a void is created in its place which looks very ugly. Is there a way to fill the void? Also, if I use a grouped cells, the remaining cell at the end of section will not have rounded bottom corners.</p></li>\n<li><p>User can drag cells from one section to another. (FYI.. drag is represented by three horizontal lines.) Issues: how popular is the drag feature? Will the users interpret it without being suggested by the app? If this the best approach, how do I implement it?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would be glad if you kindly help me pick the best option.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>what if there were three sections, is it possible to change/ move fields between 2 and 3, without making any changes to section 1?</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","ios6","ios-simulator"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13029154,"title":"ios simulator 6.0 displaying view issue","body":"<p>First time trying to develop app for iOS 6.

I followed the steps in TestFlight's tutorial for creating an IPA, but then the TestFlight desktop uploader complained \"dSYM not found\". Upon researching this, here on SO, I saw a couple different questions relating to having targets that were still set to build armv6 under Xcode 4.5. I checked my Xcode settings, and for both the product and my one compiled target (I have 3 or 4 script targets) \"Valid Architectures\" is set to \"armv7, armv7s\". I remember having to mess with this when I upgraded to Xcode 4.5, and I think I changed it then. I am building Cocos2d as a sub-project and I checked it as well. The only other archive I have is the libTestFlight.a, which is of course pre-built. I unzipped my IPA, looked in the Info.plist, and CFBundleExecutable is in fact missing, though Bundle Name, Bundle Display Name, and Executable File are all there and correct. What else could cause this? Could there be a problem with codesigning or my Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile? I have made some changes to make my bundle identifier consistent with my App ID on iTunes Connect (a case-sensitivity issue). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did in fact have a correct CFBundleExecutable. I was using PListEdit Pro to look at the Info.plist, and what it was reporting as \"Executable File\" was really CFBundleExecutable. I also took my ad-hoc signed IPA and used Xcode organizer to install it on my device, and it runs just fine, so there is no problem with the IPA, other than the TestFlight desktop app cannot find the dSYM in it. I unpacked the IPA, and it does seem that the dSYM is missing. I looked in the .xcarchive I built the IPA from, and the dSYM is present in there, so it looks like it is being stripped out by the codesigning step, perhaps? I extracted the dSYM from the xcarchive and attempted to upload it with my IPA to TestFlight. The IPA was uploaded correctly, but it does not appear the dSYM was uploaded.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","cocoa","nsview","osx-lion","nswindow"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":423,"score":0,"question_id":7543684,"title":"mouseMoved not called","body":"<p>I have a subclassed <code>NSView</code> which is part of a .xib-file of a subclassed <code>NSDocument</code>, which gets alive by the default behaviour of <code>NSDocumentController</code>'s <code>openDocument:</code> method.

Right now I have (jconfig.h, jerror.h, jmorecfg.h, jpeglib.h) under (/usr/local/include) and (libjpeg.a, libjpeg.la) under (/usr/local/lib) but I have no idea how to link/use this in my xCode project.\nCan anyone link me to a tutorial or give me a push in the right direction?\nIf anyone successfully installed and used jpeg library please help..</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","xcode","dll"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13224623,"title":"Xcode won't recognize my dynamic library","body":"<p>I built a custom dynamic library using the C/C++ Library Template.

With the design I have to implement, I cannot just use the default navigation bar</li>\n<li>works well with the UINavigationController; when the user taps the \"back\" button, the main view controller (with the button bar) should stay, but the child view controller representing the actual scene content should go back to the previous scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem currently is that the \"back\" button won't change the child controller--it changes the parent controller, returning to the previous scene before the scene with the button bars. I've tried this several different ways. I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right, or if it can't be done.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is to implement my own \"back\" functionality, keeping a stack of child view controllers and manually changing them when the user taps \"back.\" This is awkward, however, and poor design compared to using UINavigationController.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I am going the wrong way with this. I can't accept duplicating the button bar across every single scene in Interface Builder... but perhaps I should create it programmatically, and then I can easily call that code from each and every scene. Then I would have \"normal\" view controllers, and using UINavigationController would be easier. But before I go that route and completely scrap what I have so far, I wanted to see if there was another way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an overview of some parts of my solution:</p>\n\n<p>I created a ButtonBarController, laying out the Storyboard with a UIView for the buttons I wanted, and a UIView for the content pane. I also layered a button with the app logo (to go to the app's main screen) on top of a back button.</p>\n\n<p>Then I created a controller for each of those other screens. In those subscreens/child view controllers, I would first add a UIView at the correct size to fit in my content pane, and then would add all the other controls I wanted. I had all of those child view controllers inherit from another controller, which took care of a few common tasks--such as procuring a reference to the button bar controller, and code to help resize the views for 3.5\" versus 4\" screens.</p>\n\n<p>I created a changeToControllerWithIndex method; I call this when the app loads, when the user clicks one of the buttons in the main button bar to change scenes, or when anything happens in a scene requiring another scene change. I overload this method to provide two additional pieces of information: providing an NSDictionary with any extra information the child view controller needs, and to tell it whether this is a top-level scene, or whether we need a back button.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: it's important to set the Storyboard ID for those child view controllers in the Identity Inspector. I kept accidentally setting the Title in the Attribute Inspector instead)</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    [self changeToControllerWithIndex:index withPayload:nil isRootView:YES];\n}\n\n// This is the method that will change the active view controller and the view that is shown\n- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload isRootView:(BOOL)isRootView\n{\n    if (YES) {\n        self.index = index;\n\n        // The code below will properly remove the the child view controller that is\n        // currently being shown to the user and insert the new child view controller.\n        UIViewController *vc = [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:payload];\n\n        if (isRootView) {\n            NSLog(@\"putting navigation controller in\");\n            childNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n            [childNavigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];\n            [self addChildViewController:childNavigationController];\n            [childNavigationController didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n\n            if (self.currentViewController){\n                [self.currentViewController willMoveToParentViewController:nil];\n\n                [self transitionFromViewController:self.currentViewController toViewController:childNavigationController duration:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^{\n                    [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];\n                } completion:^(BOOL finished) {\n                    [self.currentViewController removeFromParentViewController];\n                    self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n                }];\n            } else {\n                [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n                self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n            }\n\n            [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n\n            //We are at the root of the navigation path, so no back button for us\n            [homeButton setHidden:NO];\n            [backButton setHidden:YES];\n        } else {\n            //Not a root view -- we're in navigation and want a back button\n\n            [childNavigationController pushViewController:vc animated:NO];\n\n            [homeButton setHidden:YES];\n            [backButton setHidden:NO];\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have an overloaded method to set up each individual view controller... some require a little more preparation than others.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    return [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:nil];\n}\n\n// This is where you instantiate each child controller and setup anything you need  on them, like delegates and public properties.\n- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload {\n    UIViewController *vc = nil;\n    if (index == CONTROLLER_HOME){\n        vc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Home\"];\n    } else if (index == CONTROLLER_CATEGORIES){\n        SAVECategoryViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Categories\"];\n        if (payload) {\n            child.currentCategory = [(NSNumber *) [(NSDictionary *)payload objectForKey:ATTRIBUTE_CAT_ID] integerValue];\n        } else {\n            child.currentCategory = CATEGORY_ALL;\n        }\n        vc = child;\n    } //etc for all the other controllers...\n    payload = nil;\n\n    return vc;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I mentioned my difficulty with managing the \"back\" navigation.

I then deleted the OLD files from the project in Xcode. Now, however, when I build, I  get a warning that these old files are missing. Somewhere Xcode still has a reference to the files that I told it to delete. Where would those references be, and how do I remove them?

The UITextView then dynamically resizes vertically to cater for the amount of text. All well and good.

With a full vertical sidewall and tip to tail wood core the BMX 88 has the makings of a powerful and unruly ski but has Kastle has seemed to tame the 88 down where it prefers smooth and driving arcs with a seemingly effortless transition edge to edge. When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88. For the skier that wants off piste versatility but splits time evenly between hard and soft snow the BMX 88 is a ski that can handle the workload with a level of grace and ease you would expect from a top end small ski builder.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;2&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Line&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Blend&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;A NEW BLEND OF ALL YOUR FAVORITE FREESTYLE SKIS.

The reduced swing weight feels like you don't have skis on your feet for floating pillow lines like a pro, ninja-like agility in the trees, and maching switch runs on the way to the park like you never left it.

The problems are obviously related to it not being signed with the correct profiles but some observations over the past few weeks have left me confused as to what profiles I am supposed to be using to sign the distrubtion.</p>\n\n<p>I had been under the impression that the ad-hoc profile should be used at both phases where signing is required - firstly setting it as the code-signing identiy within XCode as the Archive is being built, and then secondly to sign the distribution. I've been doing it this way and its been working - devices have been able to recieve the push notifications.</p>\n\n<p>Then a few weeks ago the devices stopped receiving push notifications, though there were able to receive them if the build was signed with my development profile and installed via XCode, it was only the ad-hoc distributions that stopped receiving them. After a couple of days of trying everything I eventually deleted the push and ad-hoc profiles and created new ones and everything was working again ... until a couple of days ago when the same thing happened.</p>\n\n<p>I created a new ad-hoc profile again but I still couldn't get the ad-hoc distrubtions to receive the push notifications (though the devices would once again still receive them if the app was installed via XCode). Eventually I changed from signing the distribution with the ad-hoc profile to using the apple push profile and things started working again.\nSo now I am confused:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- am I supposed to sign ad-hoc distrubtions using a) the ad-hoc profile for the archive and then ad-hoc profile again when signing the distribtion of the archive or b) the ad-hoc profile for the archive and the push profile when signing the distribution of the archive?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For XCode installations I set the code signing identity to my development profile. For ad-hoc distrubtions I set the code signing identity for the archive to the ad-hoc profile, then at the distrubtion part of the archive sign it again with the ad-hoc OR the push. The OR is there because sometimes one combination works sometimes the other combination works, my whole question therefore is which combination SHOULD it be and why have I observed inconsistency in which combination works and which doesn't.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xcode","cocoa","gui"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":291,"score":1,"question_id":7907918,"title":"How do you make a Java app with a Cocoa UI?","body":"<p>I have to use a Java API for a project, but since I'm not a fan of Java UIs and I have a Mac, I want to build a native Cocoa application around the Java code.
