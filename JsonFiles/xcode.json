I want to use it at my debian (rootserver) to access my Xcode projects (and merge, etc.). I'm able to clone the git repo with Xcode successfully, but if I try to push some (committed) changes, Xcode tells me \"Choose the Remote to witch to push the changes\" But I can't select any. I am able to push via Terminal.app, but that's not very comfortable. So why is Xcode telling me, there are no remotes available? I tried to add the remote manually (it is something like \"gitosis@myserver.com:repositories/gitosis-admin.git\"), I tried with ssh://gitosis@my..., but this dosen't even work with terminal.app.</p>\n\n<p>So why is Xcode telling me \"No Remotes available\"?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","cocoa","mvc","application"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":0,"question_id":13298342,"title":"View not updating when a message is sent to its view controller","body":"<p>I am having problems updating a view when a message from another class is sent to a ViewController.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I have an application with a single window where different custom views will be swapped out for another. I have an AppController Class that manages this and works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface AppController : NSObject\n\n@property (weak) IBOutlet NSView *ourView;\n@property (strong) NSViewController *ourViewController;\n\n- (IBAction)changeView:(id)sender;\n- (IBAction)start:(id)sender;\n- (void)changeViewContoller:(NSInteger)tag;\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When a new view is swapped out for another, the ourViewController property will be updated to point to that view's controller class. Every view controller class will have a method all named the same thing, for example \"action\". This method is supposed to change something on a view.</p>\n\n<p>So the \"start\" method in AppController class will then call the \"action\" method on the ourViewController property. To do this I used the objc_msgSend() method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>objc_msgSend(self.ourViewController, action);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed an NSLog() in the \"action\" method for each ViewController, to see if it was working, and it does, however the \"action\" method is also supposed to change a label's string value, but it does not. If anyone knows why the view is not being updated, that would be extremely helpful.

Moreover, when the framework appeared in the project navigator, expanding the node showed nothing, while other frameworks usually contain their resources and include files.</p>\n\n<p>Sniffing around I noticed that the directory structure of the framework is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AWSiOSSDK.framework/\n   Versions/\n      A/\n         Headers/\n         Resources/ \n         AWSiOSSDK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is, as far as I understand, not exactly as <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Apple requires\">Apple requires</a> it to be.

Now I wonder why. I assume a framework distributed by such a respected company as Amazon should have a correct form. Then why didn't it work? Why my modified structure works?

I am struggling with this part.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A: Internally NSURLConnection maintains a connection cache.  Each cache entry represents a set of persistent HTTP connections to a host.  When a new request comes in, it is queued on an entry in the cache.  This may be an existing entry or it may be a new entry, and it may also generate a new HTTP connection within that entry, depending on various complex factors (the protection space, the authentication status [in the case of authentication methods--yes, I'm looking at you, NTLM!--that are stateful], pipelining, various cache limits, and so on).  When a connection associated with a cache entry finishes running all of its requests, it looks for more work on the cache entry's queue; if it doesn't find any the connection goes idle.  If the connection is idle for too long, the connection is purged (which closes the underlying TCP connection).</p>\n\n<p>This cache implementation has changed in iOS 6.  Prior to iOS 6 there was a single mechanism for purging idle cache entries, with radically different timeouts for Mac OS X and iOS (30 seconds versus 6 seconds, and the iOS value could be as low as 3 seconds on older versions of iOS).  In iOS 6 there are now two mechanisms for purging idle cache entries, one that applies to connections running over WWAN and one that applies to all other connections.  The WWAN timeout has dropped back to its traditional value (3 seconds) while the all-other-connections timeout has been bumped up to the old Mac OS X default (30 seconds).</p>\n\n<p>The log message you're seeing is generated when a WWAN connection is purged.  This log message didn't exist in iOS 5.x, which explains why you're not seeing it in your tests.  However the basic mechanism has been present, in one form or another, on all versions of iOS.</p>\n\n<p>This message is more likely to be a symptom than a cause.  Specifically the message only applies to idle connections; this is just NSURLConnection cleaning up persistent HTTP connections that aren't doing anything useful.  If you're having problems with your networking you need to investigate why the connections are going idle.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","email","twitter","phone"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12,"score":1,"question_id":13282442,"title":"How can I get the Twitter following and follower Email id and MobileNo in the iPhone sdk Using MGTwitterEngine?","body":"<p>I'm unable to get the Twitter following and Followers Email id and MobileNo i am using below code for that using below code i am able to get only Twitter following name and Id Please help?</p>\n\n<pre><code>if([[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]==nil)\n{\n    urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"https://api.twitter.com/1/friends/ids.json?cursor=-1&amp;user_id=%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"Userid\"]];\n}\nelse\n{\n    urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"https://api.twitter.com/1/followers/ids.json?cursor=-1&amp;user_id=%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]];\n}\n\n\nNSURLRequest *notificationRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]];\nNSHTTPURLResponse *response;\nNSError *error;\nNSData *responData;\n\nresponData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:notificationRequest returningResponse:&amp;response error:&amp;error];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",responData);\nNSString *dataString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:responData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\n//    NSDictionary *dict = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)[dataString JSONValue]];\n//    //   NSMutableDictionary *globalCelebDict=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]initWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary *)[dataString JSONValue ] ];\n//    //NSMutableDictionary *globalCelebDictNext=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]initWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary *)[[ globalCelebDict objectForKey:@\"GetGroupDetailsResult\"] JSONValue]];\n//    NSLog(@\"dict %@\",dict);\n\nSBJSON *json = [[SBJSON alloc] init];  \nNSMutableDictionary *customDetailDict=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]init];\ncustomDetailDict=[json objectWithString:dataString error:&amp;error];\n//  NSDictionary *customDetailDict = [json objectWithString:dataString error:&amp;error];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",customDetailDict);\nif (customDetailDict!=nil) {\n    array=[[customDetailDict objectForKey:@\"ids\"]retain];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",array);\n\n    NSLog(@\"%d\",[array count]);\n    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]removeObjectForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","xcode","colors","drawing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13280556,"title":"How to do custom drawing in on a image in objective-c","body":"<p>first of all i want to say that i'm newbie in objective-c.</p>\n\n<p>till know i have build an app that simply draws on one image (which is .png image that has 3 colors: red green blue). the applications draws lines in all over the image.</p>\n\n<p>what i want is to draw lines in only one color (ex: red), even if the touch (mouse) goes up the other colors.</p>\n\n<p>can you give me some ideas on how to to this.</p>\n\n<p>the code that i'm using now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {\nmouseSwiped = YES;\n\nUITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];\ncurrentPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view];\n\nUIGraphicsBeginImageContext(CGSizeMake(320, 568));\n[drawImage.image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 568)];\nCGContextSetLineCap(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), kCGLineCapRound);\nCGContextSetLineWidth(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), 5.0);\nCGContextSetRGBStrokeColor(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), 0, 2, 0, 2);\nCGContextBeginPath(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext());\nCGContextMoveToPoint(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y);\nCGContextAddLineToPoint(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), currentPoint.x, currentPoint.y);\nCGContextStrokePath(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext());\n\n\n[drawImage setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 568)];\ndrawImage.image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();\nUIGraphicsEndImageContext();\nlastPoint = currentPoint;\n\n[self.view addSubview:drawImage];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>thnx in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","build","release"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":12,"up_vote_count":47,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20576,"score":47,"question_id":5387076,"title":"Running a release build with xcode 4","body":"<p>I see how Xcode 4 splits the info on your targets nicely in one view, but how does one build and run these different builds.

I want to be able to slide certain views using a swipe gesture (left and right) AND be able to transition vertically to other screens using a modal segue.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://postimage.org/image/u0ozw3zxt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://postimage.org/image/u0ozw3zxt/</a></p>\n\n<p>So the green screen is the main screen, and it's the root view for the navigation controller. It has 2 modal links from the info button and to the picture slide buttons.</p>\n\n<p>The red screens are IMPORTANT and I want to be able to slide back and forth between them like you can with the pictures on the Iphone camera roll. Between these screens, there is a push segue linked to a slide gesture recognizer, and I would like to be able to slide left back to the previous screen instead of the \"back\" button on the top bar. The three red screens are linked to a picture animation screen modally.</p>\n\n<p>When I run the app, If I use a modal screen then a push screen, the app crashes and I get this screen:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://postimage.org/image/lkx4pppi5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://postimage.org/image/lkx4pppi5/</a></p>\n\n<p>Now I did do about a weeks worth of research before I posted this question and I vaguely recognize that the app is crashing due to the navigation stack somehow being overloaded. I came across this but I'm not sure how to use it:</p>\n\n<p>\"When you touch the back button, the uiviewcontroller is poped (really removed) from the navigation stack. So, you can create a custom button and pop the controller by code with [MyController popViewControllerAnimated:YES]­­;</p>\n\n<p>or you can pop to the first uiviewcontroller using [MyController popToRootViewControllerAnimate­­d:YES];</p>\n\n<p>If you use a modal popup, you must use a [MyController dismissModalViewControllerAnim­ated:YES]; MyController can be self\"</p>\n\n<p>I also read about custom segues and CATransitions to modally slide left and right, but also, I'm not sure where to put the code I read about (I believe you make a new file and add it into the .h and .m files)</p>\n\n<p>So overall, I want to be able to use the slide gesture left and right (which means I have to disable the back button for the navigation controller views, and find a way to link a popviewback command to the left slide gesture) AND be able to have an up and down transition for the info and picture animation screens. </p>\n\n<p>I'm open to all techniques and THANK YOU for giving your time to help me out :) you have no clue how much this will help me reach my goals! I just request that if you decide to lay out code or a code example to tell me where to put the code (ex: place this code in a new .h file and then link this code to the .m file)</p>\n\n<p>and an example project would be the most helpful! thanks!

drawing on BitmapContext in landscape orientation with XCode 4.5 / iOS / Quartz 2D","body":"<p>i would like to do some paintings with Quartz 2D with an app on my iPhone and encounter problems with a view in landscape mode. The app is designed for landscape mode only(Supported Interface Orientations: Landscape Left). </p>\n\n<p>When i create a new View Controller in Interface Builder, there is existing a default view already. My painting view is one level below this default view and has a custom class(subclass of UIView), where i override drawRect to paint my stuff and create a BitmapContext for offscreen-rendering. My custom class is connected with the ViewController via IBOutlet, so i can control the painting stuff from within the ViewController.m file.\nIf i assign my custom class to the default view and create the Project in Portrait mode(with coordinates for portrait mode), everything is painted fine. But if i set the Interface Orientation to Landscape, the (Landscape mode-)coordinates seems to be parsed wrong and the painting is randomly inside or outside of the visible area.\nWhile using the default view for my custom class, i could fix the problem temporarily by swapping the x and y coordinates when i create the BitmapContext in testPoint and creating the CGRect inside drawRect. But when my view is one level below the default view, swapping the coordinates no longer does the trick and the view with the custom class seems to be distorted.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to be a problem with my BitmapContext or the way i do the painting in drawRect, because if i render dots directly into the current Context, the dots are displayed properly.\nIn my app there should be several different views with transparency, Background-Images and a special order. I need to paint above the view with the background image for example, so i think i need the tree structure with several views inside the default view.</p>\n\n<p>Here is some code from my custom class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {\nCGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\nCGImageRef cgImage = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(drawingContext);\nCGContextClipToRect(context, rect);\nCGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height), cgImage);\nCGImageRelease(cgImage);}\n\n- (void)testPoint {\nCGSize screenSize = [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame].size;\nCGColorSpaceRef colorSpaceRef = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();\ndrawingContext = CGBitmapContextCreate (nil, screenSize.width, screenSize.height, 8, 4*(int)screenSize.width, colorSpaceRef, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast);\nUIColor *color = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.0 blue:1.0 alpha:1.0];\nCGContextSetFillColorWithColor(drawingContext, [color CGColor]);\nCGContextSetLineCap(drawingContext, kCGLineCapRound);\nCGRect dot = CGRectMake(430, 250, 50, 50);\nCGContextFillEllipseInRect (drawingContext, dot);\n[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:dot];}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,\nDaniel</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","undefined-symbol"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":1,"question_id":13279430,"title":"LibEtPan / iOS: Symbol(s) not found …","body":"<p>I tried to use LibEtPan as a backend for a mail client.

Traditionally, we compiled the code we needed into a .dll and called that .dll when we needed a calculation done. We are now trying to create an iPad app, which unfortunately means we can't just call a .dll anymore. </p>\n\n<p>One of my coworkers have managed to make a simple Command Line Tool project, where we call a Fortran file to write \"Hello, World\" in the debugger.  However, when I try to get it to work on view based iPad app, I get a bunch of linker errors saying the symbols I'm using cannot be found.  I know that the Command Line Tool uses a .cpp file to actually run the Fortran, and I've seen many threads concerning calling .cpp files in an app, but all the ones I've seen are outdated, directly contradict each other, and their fixes don't work for me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a more direct way to call Fortran straight from a .m file?  If not, what do I have to do to take the working Command Line Tool and get it into an app?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 1: following the tutorials posted in the comments, I have been able to create a .o file from my Fortran code.  I can do a File-Add Files to add it in easily enough, but now how do I actually call it?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: Okay, baby steps.  I found out you can make a .a static library (I'll call it \"new_library\") from .o files (\"source_file.o\") using the Terminal command <code>ar crv new_library.a source_file.o</code> (you can do it for multiple .o files by just adding <code>source_file2.o source_file3.o</code> for as many .o files as you want - NOTE: make sure you use <code>cd</code> to get to the folder where the .o files are located).  I'm pretty sure Xcode will work with .a files, but it seems a .h file is still needed to let the other files in the project (like the view controllers) make calls to what's in the .a file. I know I can make a new .a file from Xcode itself (New Project -> iOS -> Framework &amp; Library -> Cocoa Touch Static Library), but when I've done it that way in the past, I just write normal .m and .h files, and when I build the new library it just mashes all the .m files into 1 .a.  When I want to use the code in that .a in another project, I just import the .a and all the .h files into the new project, and I can call the methods in the .a file just as if I had imported all the separate .m files.  So the next question is, do I still need a .h when my .a is made with the terminal instead of Xcode?  If so, how would I make a Fortran header file?  If not, how do I call my Fortran code in the .a?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","osx","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13274955,"title":"Changing reference to different object without changing initially referenced object?","body":"<p>I'm currently trying to write an XML-parser with the help of NSXMLParser.

That way I didn't mess with the tabbar and I had only to chose portrait in the \"Supported Orientations\" setting on build options and set:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {\n\n    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft);\n    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on the views I wanted landscape.</p>\n\n<p>Now with iOS6 this views are also on portrait mode, no matter what and they do not show the landscape mode even if I rotate the device. Likewise, if I allow all the orientations on the \"Supported orientations\", they all rotate, no matter what I put on the method above. </p>\n\n<p>On all the views I haven't check the box \"Use Autolayout\" on storyboards.</p>\n\n<p>Any help here?</p>\n\n<p>*<strong><em>EDIT</em>**</strong>\nNow that I see it, the App I have on the device works fine.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"}]}

Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","localization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":22,"score":1,"question_id":13243793,"title":"localization and wrong keyboard for password field","body":"<p>I have a password text field (secured), and from some reason when I change the language of the OS, the english keyboard comes up for the password field only, rather than the keyboard for the selected language.

Create a master slide that's layout is used through every slide, you create a new slide and it takes across all the masters properties (header, footer, background etc) and then it's just the content that changes on each new slide.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm not too sure how I would do this in an iOS application. I've had a look on Google searching many different phrases but all seem to be about iPad split views and using cells of a tableview, which isn't what I'm after.\nAll I can think to do is create a single view controller class, with a view, and then add a sub UIView for each page I want (about 15-20), but with the one class, and every page having different content and a lot of code required for each one, that's going to get messy! Or I simply recreate the footer and header etc on every view controller, so if there were to be a change, then I'd have 20 views (more if it grows) to edit! So I'm just wondering if there's a simple way of getting what I'm after.</p>\n\n<p>The app will be for iPad only, and I can use any OS up to 5, so xibs or storyboards are fine.

For example, the XML in the .storyboard file has its starting <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> tag's <code>toolsVersion</code> and <code>systemVersion</code> attributes altered by whatever configuration the most recent file manipulator happens to be running. Synchronizing everybody's Xcode versions precisely seems to help with <code>toolsVersion</code>, but <code>systemVersion</code> changes no matter what, depending on the specific Mac and/or OS X version the developer is running.</p>\n\n<p>This is idiotic, but mostly harmless. What worries us, though, is that at other times some other changes are automatically made to the storyboard just by opening them after a <code>git pull</code>. That is to say, Alice makes changes to a storyboard, commits and pushes them to the repository. Bob then pulls Alice's changes and opens up the storyboard to make further changes. The moment he opens the storyboard, the file icon immediately changes to a modified-but-unsaved state, and a <code>git status</code> shows that any number of weird changes have occurred. All this without Bob having changed anything or saved the file himself.</p>\n\n<p>The most common automated change we're seeing is the disappearance or reappearance of the entire <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> tag hierachy near the end of a storyboard file. We haven't figured out what is causing this. We may have several localized versions of a storyboard in various .lproj directories, and when opening them inside Interface Builder, the class hierarchy may spontaneously be removed from some and added into others, or left alone in some. This causes a lot of noise in <code>git diff</code>, but it doesn't actually break any functionality. We will often selectively add the actual changes we made into git's index, commit those, and then just discard the spontaneous, nonsensical <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> changes. This is to keep commits small and nice, as they should be. Eventually, though, it just becomes too much to bother with since Xcode keeps re-doing the changes, and someone just ragecommits them along with some other stuff... which is fine until someone else's Xcode decides to want to change them back for no apparent reason. (Our commit history has a lot of swearing over this.)</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else seeing this behaviour? Is this an Xcode bug or a configuration issue on one or more of our developer Macs? We've seen some similar behaviour when collaborating with XIB files, but storyboards seem more susceptible to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13245927,"title":"Xcode Error Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc failed with exit code 1","body":"<p>DataModelCompile /Users/maxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Pectopatop-axonkvxdjwugklfuanzpglrsyquj/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Pectopatop.app/XMPPRoster.mom Pectopatop/../../Libraries/XMPPFramework/Extensions/Roster/CoreDataStorage/XMPPRoster.xcdatamodel\n    cd /Users/maxxx/ios/Pectopatop\n    setenv PATH \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\n    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc -XD_MOMC_SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk -MOMC_PLATFORMS iphonesimulator -MOMC_PLATFORMS iphoneos /Users/maxxx/ios/Pectopatop/Pectopatop/../../Libraries/XMPPFramework/Extensions/Roster/CoreDataStorage/XMPPRoster.xcdatamodel /Users/maxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Pectopatop-axonkvxdjwugklfuanzpglrsyquj/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Pectopatop.app/XMPPRoster.mom</p>\n\n<p>Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/momc failed with exit code 1</p>\n\n<p>What is the problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","xcode"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":1,"question_id":13245888,"title":"How to specify icons for a universal iPhone/iPad app?","body":"<p>How to specify icons for a universal iPhone/iPad app with all 4 versions (icon.png, icon@2x.png ... etc)??</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced </p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","ios6","audio-recording"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13246026,"title":"MPAVController >> Not enough buffered to keep up","body":"<p>I am playing video using this code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>player= [[ MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:movieURL];\nplayer.navigationController.navigationBar.hidden = YES;\nplayer.moviePlayer.scalingMode = MPMovieScalingModeAspectFit;\nplayer.moviePlayer.controlStyle = MPMovieControlStyleNone;\nplayer.moviePlayer.movieSourceType = MPMovieSourceTypeFile;\nplayer.moviePlayer.fullscreen = NO;\n[self presentModalViewController:player animated:NO];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Video playing works perfectly But the problem is that after finishing play i am getting this result in console.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[MPAVController] Autoplay: Likely to keep up or full buffer: 0\n[MPAVController] Autoplay: Skipping autoplay, not enough buffered to keep up.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then after i am trying to record the voice but unable to record.</p>\n\n<p>can anybody help me to solve this issue.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","code-signing","jailbreak"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":402,"score":2,"question_id":12768109,"title":"How to use ldid?","body":"<p>I am trying to run unsigned application on iOS 5.1/iPhone 4s (jailbroken).

I have this issue where I am using a class to store global information that is needed through out the code because it stores the list of food that a user adds to their meal plan. The issue that I have is that one it is a relatively large data structure that I am using. The data structure is a dictionary with keys to five other dictionaries that all have 8 mutable arrays that can be as large as the user wishes due to the fact that can add as much food as their heart desires.</p>\n\n<p>I have set the structure like so</p>\n\n<pre><code>mealInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]\n[mealInfo setObject:[NSMutableDictionary dictionary] forKey:\"foo\"];\n[[mealInfo objectForKey:\"such\"] setObject: [NSMutableArray array] forKey:\"bar\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is repeated for the complete data structure. This did seem to solve some of my possible memory leaks when I analyzed in xcode. The issue is further then that cause I have an idea what the issue is just not the solution. I have objects created, which create this structure in the local scope of the .m file I am in. I go save this structure in the class where mealInfo is created, not the local scope, with a static object of that class. (<em>I am not using too much code because it is one in a lot of locations and two is way too many lines</em>)</p>\n\n<p>After I save to the static variable of the class I release the local scope, I can not release the mealInfo because when I have done that in the past it actually causes the object to disappear and nil in the class that it was initialized in making it inaccessible to other classes trying to access this information. </p>\n\n<p>One solution I thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getters and setters, but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times. This I was trying to avoid. I will do that if that is the only solution, but would like to get this method to work first. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is not too confusing.

cells in tableView","body":"<p>I am posting this question to get suggestion about an issue. FYI... I have tried approaches 1 and 2, but I am not satisfied with the outcome from programming (and partly UX also) perspective(s).</p>\n\n<p>I have a table which has 2 sections. Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField. When the user presses <code>Edit</code> button (located on the <code>navigationBar</code>), the user can change the position of the cells, i.e. - s/he can move the cells from one section to another. Simple!</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been considering three approaches.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Include a <code>UIButton</code> object with each cell. The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach. Even worse, I will have to keep a track of the index where the cell should appear when it translates from one section to another.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have 8 cells in section 1 and 2. 4 cells of second section appear as hidden in the first section and vice versa. When the user presses + in one section A, its property should be set to hidden in section A and it should be made visible in section B. However, when the cell's property is set to hidden, a void is created in its place which looks very ugly. Is there a way to fill the void? Also, if I use a grouped cells, the remaining cell at the end of section will not have rounded bottom corners.</p></li>\n<li><p>User can drag cells from one section to another. (FYI.. drag is represented by three horizontal lines.) Issues: how popular is the drag feature? Will the users interpret it without being suggested by the app? If this the best approach, how do I implement it?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would be glad if you kindly help me pick the best option.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>what if there were three sections, is it possible to change/ move fields between 2 and 3, without making any changes to section 1?</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","ios6","ios-simulator"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":13029154,"title":"ios simulator 6.0 displaying view issue","body":"<p>First time trying to develop app for iOS 6.

I followed the steps in TestFlight's tutorial for creating an IPA, but then the TestFlight desktop uploader complained \"dSYM not found\". Upon researching this, here on SO, I saw a couple different questions relating to having targets that were still set to build armv6 under Xcode 4.5. I checked my Xcode settings, and for both the product and my one compiled target (I have 3 or 4 script targets) \"Valid Architectures\" is set to \"armv7, armv7s\". I remember having to mess with this when I upgraded to Xcode 4.5, and I think I changed it then. I am building Cocos2d as a sub-project and I checked it as well. The only other archive I have is the libTestFlight.a, which is of course pre-built. I unzipped my IPA, looked in the Info.plist, and CFBundleExecutable is in fact missing, though Bundle Name, Bundle Display Name, and Executable File are all there and correct. What else could cause this? Could there be a problem with codesigning or my Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile? I have made some changes to make my bundle identifier consistent with my App ID on iTunes Connect (a case-sensitivity issue). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did in fact have a correct CFBundleExecutable. I was using PListEdit Pro to look at the Info.plist, and what it was reporting as \"Executable File\" was really CFBundleExecutable. I also took my ad-hoc signed IPA and used Xcode organizer to install it on my device, and it runs just fine, so there is no problem with the IPA, other than the TestFlight desktop app cannot find the dSYM in it. I unpacked the IPA, and it does seem that the dSYM is missing. I looked in the .xcarchive I built the IPA from, and the dSYM is present in there, so it looks like it is being stripped out by the codesigning step, perhaps? I extracted the dSYM from the xcarchive and attempted to upload it with my IPA to TestFlight. The IPA was uploaded correctly, but it does not appear the dSYM was uploaded.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","cocoa","nsview","osx-lion","nswindow"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":424,"score":0,"question_id":7543684,"title":"mouseMoved not called","body":"<p>I have a subclassed <code>NSView</code> which is part of a .xib-file of a subclassed <code>NSDocument</code>, which gets alive by the default behaviour of <code>NSDocumentController</code>'s <code>openDocument:</code> method.

My ios app is just a simple navigation controller with a indexpath that should send the title of the row selected of a custom dynamic cell () to a uilabel.

The error happens just before moving to the next view and is in the log as: <strong>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '[__NSDictionaryI isEqualToString:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x8887670'.</strong> However, it does give the nslog result of indexPathrow:0 or 1 or whatever was selected.

Interestingly if I create a new \"hello, world\" command line tool in a new project it works just fine -- and it is not signed at all.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the file and it has -rwxr-xr-x permission.  In the debugger the app fails on startup even before it tries to access the moms.  If I try to run this outside of the debugger at the command line, it ends with a kill 9 message.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode","header","tableview","footer"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13211242,"title":"What are the default iPhone tableView footer and font styles?","body":"<p>Does anyone know what the default styles are for the headers / footers in the standard UITableViewGrouped style?</p>\n\n<p>The protocol reference just mentions ' The table view uses a fixed font style for section footer titles.

With the design I have to implement, I cannot just use the default navigation bar</li>\n<li>works well with the UINavigationController; when the user taps the \"back\" button, the main view controller (with the button bar) should stay, but the child view controller representing the actual scene content should go back to the previous scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem currently is that the \"back\" button won't change the child controller--it changes the parent controller, returning to the previous scene before the scene with the button bars. I've tried this several different ways. I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right, or if it can't be done.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is to implement my own \"back\" functionality, keeping a stack of child view controllers and manually changing them when the user taps \"back.\" This is awkward, however, and poor design compared to using UINavigationController.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I am going the wrong way with this. I can't accept duplicating the button bar across every single scene in Interface Builder... but perhaps I should create it programmatically, and then I can easily call that code from each and every scene. Then I would have \"normal\" view controllers, and using UINavigationController would be easier. But before I go that route and completely scrap what I have so far, I wanted to see if there was another way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an overview of some parts of my solution:</p>\n\n<p>I created a ButtonBarController, laying out the Storyboard with a UIView for the buttons I wanted, and a UIView for the content pane. I also layered a button with the app logo (to go to the app's main screen) on top of a back button.</p>\n\n<p>Then I created a controller for each of those other screens. In those subscreens/child view controllers, I would first add a UIView at the correct size to fit in my content pane, and then would add all the other controls I wanted. I had all of those child view controllers inherit from another controller, which took care of a few common tasks--such as procuring a reference to the button bar controller, and code to help resize the views for 3.5\" versus 4\" screens.</p>\n\n<p>I created a changeToControllerWithIndex method; I call this when the app loads, when the user clicks one of the buttons in the main button bar to change scenes, or when anything happens in a scene requiring another scene change. I overload this method to provide two additional pieces of information: providing an NSDictionary with any extra information the child view controller needs, and to tell it whether this is a top-level scene, or whether we need a back button.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: it's important to set the Storyboard ID for those child view controllers in the Identity Inspector. I kept accidentally setting the Title in the Attribute Inspector instead)</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    [self changeToControllerWithIndex:index withPayload:nil isRootView:YES];\n}\n\n// This is the method that will change the active view controller and the view that is shown\n- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload isRootView:(BOOL)isRootView\n{\n    if (YES) {\n        self.index = index;\n\n        // The code below will properly remove the the child view controller that is\n        // currently being shown to the user and insert the new child view controller.\n        UIViewController *vc = [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:payload];\n\n        if (isRootView) {\n            NSLog(@\"putting navigation controller in\");\n            childNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n            [childNavigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];\n            [self addChildViewController:childNavigationController];\n            [childNavigationController didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n\n            if (self.currentViewController){\n                [self.currentViewController willMoveToParentViewController:nil];\n\n                [self transitionFromViewController:self.currentViewController toViewController:childNavigationController duration:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^{\n                    [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];\n                } completion:^(BOOL finished) {\n                    [self.currentViewController removeFromParentViewController];\n                    self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n                }];\n            } else {\n                [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n                self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n            }\n\n            [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n\n            //We are at the root of the navigation path, so no back button for us\n            [homeButton setHidden:NO];\n            [backButton setHidden:YES];\n        } else {\n            //Not a root view -- we're in navigation and want a back button\n\n            [childNavigationController pushViewController:vc animated:NO];\n\n            [homeButton setHidden:YES];\n            [backButton setHidden:NO];\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have an overloaded method to set up each individual view controller... some require a little more preparation than others.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    return [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:nil];\n}\n\n// This is where you instantiate each child controller and setup anything you need  on them, like delegates and public properties.\n- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload {\n    UIViewController *vc = nil;\n    if (index == CONTROLLER_HOME){\n        vc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Home\"];\n    } else if (index == CONTROLLER_CATEGORIES){\n        SAVECategoryViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Categories\"];\n        if (payload) {\n            child.currentCategory = [(NSNumber *) [(NSDictionary *)payload objectForKey:ATTRIBUTE_CAT_ID] integerValue];\n        } else {\n            child.currentCategory = CATEGORY_ALL;\n        }\n        vc = child;\n    } //etc for all the other controllers...\n    payload = nil;\n\n    return vc;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I mentioned my difficulty with managing the \"back\" navigation.

I set the base SDK to 4.3 and deployment target to 4.0 so in theory, it should run on everything in-between.

However, when I uploaded the .ipa file to testflightapp.com and someone tested it on an iPhone 3G running OS 4.2.1, it seems to crash on launch. Since it runs fine on the same version of the simulator, this makes me think there is something in project settings I haven't done right.

To squelch this message \nand maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use: \n\n  git config --global push.default matching\n\nTo squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use: \n\n  git config --global push.default simple\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I googled it and find this question not so long ago: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13148066/warning-push-default-is-unset-its-implicit-value-is-changing-in-git-2-0\" title=\"Warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in Git 2.0\">13148066</a>, and got it settled, I use <code>git config --global push.default simple</code> since \"This is a more intuitive behavior, which is why the default is getting changed to this.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think my problem with XCode must have a connection with this git option update.</p>\n\n<p>Back to XCode, I did not choose to setup a git repo in my XCode project, but used the snapshot as a way to backup my code. I think there's some trick with git in XCode's snapshot, I cannot figure it out. Now I wonder if anyone can tell me how to re-enable the snapshot in XCode (while not to change the .gitconfig [push.default] option)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","gdb"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13105602,"title":"xcode 4.5.1 not loading .gdbinit","body":"<p>I have a .gdbinit file.

As it stands they can also edit the text in this UITextView with as many characters as they like (my boss wants to limit any kind of prescriptive behaviour). The UITextView then dynamically resizes vertically to cater for the amount of text. All well and good. However, once the height of this UITextView exceeds a certain size, any subsequent characters will be added but will be hidden from view, unless I allow the UITextView to be scrollable.</p>\n\n<p>I would have to add that this is an edge case. However, because the app encourages this sort of behaviour there is a possibility that this limit could be encountered occasionally. </p>\n\n<p>Am I right in thinking there is actually a limit on the height for a UITextView? Or is the issue potentially something else?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay maybe I'm misunderstanding my own situation. I failed to consider the fact that the textView sits within a tableViewCell, and what I am actually doing is resizing the cell as the textView size increases.

In order to ensure the height was allowed to be as high as it wanted, a supposedly unreachable high number was used for the height constraint (1000). As you can guess, 1000 was not enough for the purpose of this and therefore the textView was stopping short.

With a full vertical sidewall and tip to tail wood core the BMX 88 has the makings of a powerful and unruly ski but has Kastle has seemed to tame the 88 down where it prefers smooth and driving arcs with a seemingly effortless transition edge to edge. When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88. For the skier that wants off piste versatility but splits time evenly between hard and soft snow the BMX 88 is a ski that can handle the workload with a level of grace and ease you would expect from a top end small ski builder.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;2&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Line&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Blend&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;A NEW BLEND OF ALL YOUR FAVORITE FREESTYLE SKIS.

The reduced swing weight feels like you don't have skis on your feet for floating pillow lines like a pro, ninja-like agility in the trees, and maching switch runs on the way to the park like you never left it.

Featuring narrower dimensions and more traditional tail-shape than the S7, the S3 delivers increased agility and all-mountain versatility. Powder Turn Rocker delivers fatigue-free manueverability, effortless steering and instant speed control, making powder skiing easier and more fun. Centered Sidecut provides the all-terrain versatility and edging power simply not found in other wide-waisted, rockered skis.

The problems are obviously related to it not being signed with the correct profiles but some observations over the past few weeks have left me confused as to what profiles I am supposed to be using to sign the distrubtion.</p>\n\n<p>I had been under the impression that the ad-hoc profile should be used at both phases where signing is required - firstly setting it as the code-signing identiy within XCode as the Archive is being built, and then secondly to sign the distribution. I've been doing it this way and its been working - devices have been able to recieve the push notifications.</p>\n\n<p>Then a few weeks ago the devices stopped receiving push notifications, though there were able to receive them if the build was signed with my development profile and installed via XCode, it was only the ad-hoc distributions that stopped receiving them. After a couple of days of trying everything I eventually deleted the push and ad-hoc profiles and created new ones and everything was working again ... until a couple of days ago when the same thing happened.</p>\n\n<p>I created a new ad-hoc profile again but I still couldn't get the ad-hoc distrubtions to receive the push notifications (though the devices would once again still receive them if the app was installed via XCode). Eventually I changed from signing the distribution with the ad-hoc profile to using the apple push profile and things started working again.\nSo now I am confused:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- am I supposed to sign ad-hoc distrubtions using a) the ad-hoc profile for the archive and then ad-hoc profile again when signing the distribtion of the archive or b) the ad-hoc profile for the archive and the push profile when signing the distribution of the archive?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For XCode installations I set the code signing identity to my development profile. For ad-hoc distrubtions I set the code signing identity for the archive to the ad-hoc profile, then at the distrubtion part of the archive sign it again with the ad-hoc OR the push. The OR is there because sometimes one combination works sometimes the other combination works, my whole question therefore is which combination SHOULD it be and why have I observed inconsistency in which combination works and which doesn't.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xcode","cocoa","gui"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":291,"score":1,"question_id":7907918,"title":"How do you make a Java app with a Cocoa UI?","body":"<p>I have to use a Java API for a project, but since I'm not a fan of Java UIs and I have a Mac, I want to build a native Cocoa application around the Java code.

I've checked over the method but could not find anything wrong with it.  However, if I comment everything inside the method out and return nil, the code compiles.  I went through and uncommented every line until I got the error.  The error causing the problem is this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>[super.inputField addSubview:_checked];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I had intended on using 'self' instead of 'super'(which was a typo on my part).  But super does in fact have a inputField property.  It's not redefined or overwritten in the subclass.  So accessing 'super.inputField' vs 'self.inputField' should access the exact same thing (and did before upgrading Xcode).  OK, so changing 'super' to 'self' does fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p>My question now is: Why?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode","sqlite3","crash","exc-bad-access"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13135794,"title":"Getting Exc_Bad_Access in sqlite3_prepare_v2 irregularly","body":"<p>Before inserting into livecategories, I am checking this id is exists if not then insert the value.

I thought this would be as simple as adding a login view controller to the array but oooh how wrong I was D: When I tried that I got this error:</p>\n\n<p><em>*</em> Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[UIViewController _isResizable]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xa160660'</p>\n\n<p>I do apologise for being such a noob I'm new to all of this just trying to get my head around it.

Xcode then reports the next duplicate it finds during linking, and so on, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I can continue the renaming process although I'd rather not, as I'm concerned that there is a more pathological underlying issue.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice or question is appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","xcode4"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1885,"score":7,"question_id":5626788,"title":"Custom key bindings Xcode 4?","body":"<p>Awhile back I asked a question about <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476953/xcode-delete-line-hot-key\">custom key bindings in Xcode</a>.

I make a small edit to the AppDelegate or any other file, and Source Control commits will not work from within XCode.  From the command-line, I see that .git was created in the project directory, and that the 'first commit' occurred.

The location is displayed as /Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/\nBut in the area where the commit comments are normally displayed, I see the message \"Unable to load revisions\".</p>\n\n<p>The likely cause was that XCode was internally identifying the Project directory as ~/Documents/Code, not ~/Documents/CODE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One way to resolve the issue</strong> was to rename ~/Documents/CODE into ~/Documents/Code, then in Organizer (select the Repositories Tab) I deleted the repository listing for MyProjectName.  NOTE - Only removes XCode's reference to the repository, the actual repository remains intact.  Now Close XCode and Reopen it.  Open the project MyProjectName.  XCode will recreate a reference to the Project with the correct Capitalization.  Note that the renaming of the directory seems to force XCode to recognize the new directory name when the repository is recreated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another way to resolve the issue is:</strong> within XCode's Organizer window (select the Repositories Tab), delete the reference to the repository.  Then, still in Organizer, select the \"Projects\" tab at top.  To the left of the project's window is a list of all the projects...select MyProjectName.  Now in the center frame is a field named \"Derived Data\" with a path to your project.  Click the little -> arrow to the right of the PATH to open up the Project's Internal Settings Directory in Finder.  Open the file called \"info.plist\" and edit the key \"WorkspacePath\" such that it's value EXACTLY MATCHES the location of your project (correct the capitalization of the directory if necessary).  Save, and return to Organizer.  Close XCode.  Reopen XCode and the repository reference will be recreated.  You can go directly into Organizer now, select the \"Repositories\" tab, then select MyProjectName's repository.  You'll see the commit messages there (even if you haven't committed yet, you'll still see the auto-generated 'first-commit' that occurred internally when your project was created).</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","sqlite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":107,"score":-1,"question_id":9760982,"title":"Select query not working in SQLite","body":"<p>i am running a method for containing select query, but compiled statement is not working the break point skips the line where it declares it and when i puts the cursor on it it shows no value, Here's the code i am using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(NSMutableArray *)GetAllPartsName\n{\n    NSString *path = [self getDBPath];\n    // Open the database from the users filessytem\n\n    NSMutableArray *Parts=[[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]autorelease ];\n    if(sqlite3_open([path UTF8String], &amp;database) == SQLITE_OK) {\n        // Setup the SQL Statement and compile it for faster access\n\n        NSString *sqlQuery = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"SELECT Parts_Name FROM Parts\"];\n        NSLog(@\"%@\",sqlQuery);\n        const char *sqlStatement = [sqlQuery UTF8String]; \n        //The break point skips the sqlite3_stmt.\n        sqlite3_stmt *compiledStatement;\n        //when i put the cursor over compiledStatement it shows no value\n        if(sqlite3_prepare_v2(database, sqlStatement, -1, &amp;compiledStatement, NULL) == SQLITE_OK) {\n            // Loop through the results and add them to the feeds array\n            while(sqlite3_step(compiledStatement) == SQLITE_ROW) {\n                // Read the data from the result row\n                NSMutableDictionary *PositionDict=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]init];\n                //setting the parts into dictionary\n                [PositionDict setObject:[NSString stringWithUTF8String:(char *)sqlite3_column_text(compiledStatement,0)] forKey:@\"Parts_Name\"];\n                [Parts addObject:PositionDict];\n                NSLog(@\"%@\",PositionDict);\n                [PositionDict release];\n            }\n        }\n        // Release the compiled statement from memory\n        sqlite3_finalize(compiledStatement);\n    }\n    sqlite3_close(database);\n    return Parts;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","xcode","iad","adbannerview"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13103315,"title":"iAd Banner not working","body":"<p>SO I used a tutorial to create an iAd Banner at the bottom of the screen and animate it into and out of the window, however the app is a tab based, and i do not quite know the correct offset, so you could tell me I would appreciate it, however the primary problem, is that the adBanner does not always appear, and when it does sometimes it is just a white box.

The project directly added to the project and I could not set, \"copy items\" and \"Reference Type\" properties. I don't know it is a new feature of xcode 4.5 or a bug. That is the only step I could correctly do as given in README file. </p>\n\n<p>Well, you have all information that I have with me. I am trying to fix this for 6 hours.

I just need to sort it by modification date, not alphabetically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Create dictionary with attributes I care about and a fileList array\n\n        NSMutableArray *fileList  = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:10];\n        NSDictionary *fileData = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:file, @\"file\", dateString, @\"date\", nil];\n\n        [fileList addObject:fileData];\n\n//I don't know how to sort this array by the \"date\" key!\n\n        NSArray         *files = [fm contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:folderPath error:NULL];\n    //iterate through files array\n        for (NSString *file in files) {\n            NSString *path = [folderPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:file];\n    //code to create custom object with contents of file as properties\n    //feed object to fileList, which displays it in the tableview\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've read everything I could find online about it, but I just don't understand how this sorting would work. I understand there are about four different ways to sort, but which one do I chose to sort the array by the date key in the dictionary and how would I implement it here?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Found the answer about 5 seconds after posting this. The code I needed was:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSSortDescriptor *aSortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@\"date\" ascending:YES];\n[sortedFiles sortUsingDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:aSortDescriptor]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So stupidly easy, I've spent all day on this!</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","facebook","sdk","linker"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":113,"score":1,"question_id":13076296,"title":"XCode 4.5, Facebook SDK 3.1 implementation resulting in \"...selected destination does not support the architecture ...\" error","body":"<p>Presently getting the following error:</p>\n\n<p>Cannot run on the Selected Destination</p>\n\n<p>The selected destination does not support the architecture for which the selected software is built.

I'm writing a simple iPhone app utilizing storyboard that has a tall png file displayed via UIImageView embedded within a UIScrollView and a button next to it that will play a movie.</p>\n\n<p>My issue is that when the movie finishes/exits and comes back to the original screen, the scrolling within the UIScrollView does not work.  I have nailed down the \"cause\".  It occurs when I add the MPMoviePlayerViewController object.view to the self.view subview.  But I'm not sure how to rectify this issue.

However upon switching to <code>MPMoviePlayerViewController</code> some interesting things have been happening.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the changed -(void)playMovie</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void) playMovie {\n   self.scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointZero;\n   NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle]\n                                    pathForResource:totalTitle ofType:@\"mp4\"]];\n   MPMoviePlayerViewController *playerController =  [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:url];\n   [self presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated:playerController];\n   playerController.moviePlayer.movieSourceType = MPMovieSourceTypeFile;\n   [playerController.moviePlayer play];\n   playerController = nil;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is interesting is that the UIScrollView will still work, HOWEVER, if it has been scrolled down at all it will no longer be able to scroll up from where it was when the movie started.  I fixed this by adding <code>self.scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointZero</code> at the beginning of the <code>playMovie</code> to tell the scrollView to move to the top (so there would be nothing above it to have to scroll back to).  I assume that adding some sort of if-statement to the code in <code>viewDidAppear</code> that would keep scrollView.contentSize from re-executing might fix the problem of not being able to scroll back up, however I like the 'cleanness' of it starting back at the top.</p>\n\n<p>One last issue though.  Using MPMoviePlayerViewController like this has caused a number of interesting errors to pop up in my debugger right when <code>MPMoviePlayerViewController *playerController =  [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:url];</code> line is executed.  They are as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Oct 25 10:25:51 Compy.local AppName[14590] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextSaveGState: invalid context 0x0 \nOct 25 10:25:51 Compy.local AppName[14590] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextClipToRect: invalid context 0x0\nOct 25 10:25:51 Compy.local AppName[14590] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextTranslateCTM: invalid context 0x0\nOct 25 10:25:51 Compy.local AppName[14590] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextDrawShading: invalid context 0x0\nOct 25 10:25:51 Compy.local AppName[14590] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextRestoreGState: invalid context 0x0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It doesn't seem to break anything.

I've done some research on these errors, however I haven't found anything suitable that would lend a strong hand in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all the help so far!

Then i copied the files from the other sources folder from the Push Sample into my phonegap folder Supported Files including the AirshipConfig.plist. Also I set the Header Search Paths in the Build Settings to the Airship folder, what i copied before into the xCode project folder. </p>\n\n<p>Now I get the error (6) \"Use of undeclared identifier 'UAPush'\" in the AppDeledate.m file.

I'm not quite sure how to tackle this. I want the page that opens up to be entirely scrollable (Like the IGN application or Slashgear application). Many apps for websites utilize this (and I am a bit new to this). How do they go about this? I also want to note, at some point I will like to cache the data so it may load what is already loaded without being connected to the internet. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nOk, I believe I found the correct path to go down from playing around and a lot of googling (nothing directly says what a decent way of doing this is). My particular way as of now is the route of a UIScrollView in general. Now the part I don't understand is how to divide up the long text into 'pages' for scrolling (and I am using the paging feature. This situation has led me into this question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13021253/how-to-separate-strings-for-uiscrollview-uitextview-based-on-the-size-of-the-fra\">How To Separate Strings For UIScrollView/UITextView based on the size of the frame</a> </p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","ios5","uinavigationcontroller","ios6","uinavigationbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":0,"question_id":13039544,"title":"how to custom navigation bar in ios 5 and ios 6?","body":"<p>As I saw when I searched here it was a lot of questions on the same topic, but I really dont know which codes to use and where to put them.</p>\n\n<p>I simply want to change the navigation bar to a custom bar with my own background image. </p>\n\n<p>I did see some codes, but I am really new so I dont know how to do this! </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/a/atmarkatmark/20071203/20071203220244.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Like this</a></p>\n\n<p>-Simon</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","algorithm","line","point"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":2,"question_id":12922789,"title":"Finding point is close to line and between the endpoints of the line","body":"<p>To find if the point is on a specified line containing two points i do the following checks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(Boolean)isOnLine:(Line*) line point:(CGPoint) point{\n    //If between two dots:\n    if (((line.first.x &lt;= point.x &amp;&amp; point.x &lt;= line.last.x)||(line.first.x &gt;= point.x &amp;&amp; point.x &gt;= line.last.x))&amp;&amp;((line.first.y&lt;=point.y &amp;&amp; point.y&lt;= line.last.y)||(line.first.y&gt;=point.y &amp;&amp; point.y&gt;=line.last.y)) ) {    \n        //Calculate distance:\n        double dist = (((double)point.y - line.first.y)) / (0.00001+((double)(point.x - line.first.x)))- ((double)(line.last.y - line.first.y)) / (0.00001+((double)(line.last.x - line.first.x)));\n        NSLog(@\"Dist to line: %f\", fabs(dist));\n        return fabs(dist) &lt;0.5;\n    }else\n        return NO;  \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Somehow, however, the function is not working with vertical lines.

And could I perhaps use Nearby places API if I make the functionality entirely separate from the check-in functional wise (very lame for the user but it's being with the back against the wall).<br>\nAnother way I had in mind was to get bar owners to paste qr codes of their own bars on windows or make stamps on beer cards.

Finally, what's the difference between sh and bash?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","xcode","adwhirl"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":13013505,"title":"Adwhirl gives error inside navigation controller","body":"<p>I have an adwhirlview in my navigation controller at the \"2nd page\" so it's root -> adwhirlpage. </p>\n\n<p>The showing of the banner goes great, but if I pop the navigationcontroller back to  root, after 20 secs or so, the debugger gives me an error:</p>\n\n<pre><code> -[__NSCFTimer viewControllerForPresentingModalView]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xa8a5cc0\n2012-10-22 16:22:49.173 Tap Chap backup[1376:1be03] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFTimer viewControllerForPresentingModalView]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xa8a5cc0'\n*** First throw call stack:\n(0x1ddb022 0x2e4ccd6 0x1ddccbd 0x1d41ed0 0x1d41cb2 0xe806 0x1d172 0x1c63e 0x1d331 0x1731eb6 0x1daf936 0x1daf3d7 0x1d12790 0x1d11d84 0x1d11c9b 0x23947d8 0x239488a 0xdf5626 0x2dea 0x2d35)\nterminate called throwing an exception(lldb) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My code is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(IBAction)backMainMenu\n{\n    [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];\n    [self.adwhirlView1 removeFromSuperview];\n}\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [self showBanner];\n}\n\n-(UIViewController *)viewControllerForPresentingModalView\n{\n    return self.navigationController;\n}\n\n-(NSString *)adWhirlApplicationKey \n{\n    return @\"my key\";\n}\n\n-(void)showBanner\n{\n    self.adwhirlView1  = [AdWhirlView requestAdWhirlViewWithDelegate:self];\n\n    //  adwhirlView1.bounds = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 480, 50);\n\n    [self.navigationController.view addSubview:self.adwhirlView1];\n\n}\n\n-(void)adWhirlDidReceiveAd:(AdWhirlView *) adWhirlView \n{\n    [UIView beginAnimations:@\"AdWhirlDelegate.adWhirlDidReceiveAd:\" context:nil];\n\n    [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.7];\n    CGSize adSize = [adwhirlView1 actualAdSize];\n    CGRect newFrame = adwhirlView1.frame;\n    newFrame.size = adSize;\n    newFrame.origin.x = (self.view.bounds.size.width - adSize.width)/ 2;\n    adwhirlView1.frame = newFrame;\n\n    CGAffineTransform makeLandscape = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(degreesToRadians(0));\n    makeLandscape = CGAffineTransformTranslate(makeLandscape, -480/2 + 48/2, 320/2 - 48/2 - 12);\n    makeLandscape = CGAffineTransformScale(makeLandscape, 480.0/320, 480.0/320);\n    adwhirlView1.transform = makeLandscape;\n\n    adwhirlView1.frame = CGRectMake(0, 250, 480, 100);\n\n    [UIView commitAnimations];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope you guys can help me with removing this error, which thus gives the already placed error.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":119,"score":1,"question_id":13032603,"title":"XCode 4.5.1 crash on start up","body":"<p>Can anyone help me with this.
