I've spent quite a bit time to search/research for the issue but didn't find a solution. To demonstrate the problem, I've reduced the flash movie to a very simple structure. </p>\n\n<p>One the main timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first frame has a movie clip (Game MC) and a stop action.</li>\n<li>Following the first frame, there are several frames, mostly empty except some text.     </li>\n<li>The last frame has a stop action.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On the Game MC timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is only one frame. On that frame, there is a movie clip (Card MC), and the stop action. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On the Card MC timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It starts with 3 blank frames and a stop action. </li>\n<li>Starting at frame 4, a sound (.wav format) is placed and is set to be \"stream.\" </li>\n<li>At the end of this timeline, there is a stop action.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From Flash CS3, I press Ctrl+Enter to test the movie. The movie stops on frame 1 of the main timeline with the card showing, no sound, as expected. Now I use \".\" to move the play head forward one frame at a time. No problem. I see the frames after the first frame. Still no sound, as expected. So far so good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem starts</strong> when I use \",\" to move the play head backward, the sound in the Card MC starts to play, regardless where the play head is, even when the Game MC (thence the Card MC) is not on the stage. Worse, each press of \",\" will trigger another start of the same sound overlapping with the previous one. And the sound would continue in loops until I close the swf. </p>\n\n<p><strong>However,</strong> the problem will not occur if I place the Card MC directly on the main timeline. It only occurs when it is inside another movie clip (Game MC). </p>\n\n<p>I need to solve this problem because the full version of the flash card game is to be placed in an HTML page with a javascript based play control, which allows the viewer to jump around in the swf timeline.   </p>\n\n<p>The fla file is at: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_5mgotjr4l5RDZaOGxFeFFWN1U/edit?pli=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_5mgotjr4l5RDZaOGxFeFFWN1U/edit?pli=1</a></p>\n\n<p>Any insight will be greatly appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Keith</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","flash"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13280734,"title":"Dynamically add javascript slideshow code to header of templated site","body":"<p>I am working with a very outdated templated site that does not let me change anything in the top portion of the site.

When the instructor clicks on one of the cars a duplicate is created on the stage where the instructor can drag and drop that duplicate any where on the stage. If he/she clicks on another car the same thing happens, but if one of the duplicates is dropped on top of another car the train building will begin. The new car will snap to the right of the target and if another is dropped it will snap to the right and so on, but where I run into trouble is when I add the third car it only snaps half way.</p>\n\n<p>The registration point is messing things up for me, it's center, so I need to figure out half width of the target and half width of the car being dropped which will give me the point of which the car will snap to. So for example:</p>\n\n<p>target car is 50 and the car being dropped is 50 then the point to snap to should be 25 + 25.

This theme is very complex. It heavily uses javascript it has a 700 code lines long javascript file, called <em>custom.js</em>, which manages the whole website using AJAX. For this reason i couldn't include the js code to load the Jplayer into the .php page file, but i needed to put it into a separate js file and call this file from <em>custom.js</em>.\nSo, into <em>custom.js</em> i added the following lines, which include into the page  my file named <em>chiama-player.js</em>.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var html_doc = document.getElementsByTagName('head').item(0);\nvar js = document.createElement('script');\njs.setAttribute('language', 'javascript');\njs.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');\njs.setAttribute('src', \"/wp-content/themes/Gleam/chiama-player.js\");\nhtml_doc.appendChild(js);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The file named <em>chiama-player.js</em> contains the code to instatiate the jPlayer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {\nif(window.location.href==\"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/#!/le-canzoni/\" || window.location.href==\"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/le-canzoni/\"){\n    $(\"#jp_container_1\").css( { 'display': 'block' } );\n    $(\"#jquery_jplayer_1\").jPlayer( {\n        ready: function () {\n            $(this).jPlayer(\"setMedia\", {\n                m4a: \"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/wp-content/themes/Gleam/shakeit.m4a\",\n            });\n        },\n        swfPath: \"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/wp-content/themes/Gleam/jplayer\",\n        supplied: \"m4a\"\n    });\n}\nelse{\n    $(\"#jp_container_1\").css( { 'display': 'none' } );\n}\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>THE PROBLEM:\nEverything works GREAT on the browsers who support m4a. This means i correctly included the code to load the jPlayer.\nThe problem comes with Firefox. Firefox does not support m4a, so it needs the flash fallback to work. When i try to load the page on Firefox i see that the swfPath is correctly recognized (in fact if i alter the path and i type some random text, i see a 404 in the FireBug Net window). The problem is that the request\n\"GET Jplayer.swf\"\nnever gets a result and keeps loading for hours without getting the file.

Has anyone ran into such a problem where the page content gets garbled, but, resizing the browser window fixes it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13253320,"title":"actionscript 3 TextField visible characters indexes","body":"<p>I'm implementing a scrollbar for my non editable <em>textField</em>, and i have to enable pageup, pagedown, end, mousewheel as well. everything works, except wheel sometimes. <strong>I'd need to get the first visible characters index</strong> to make sure that the keyboard 'cursor' is updated via  <em>setselection</em> . \nI tried with scrollV, but thats sometimes not ok.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3208,"score":1,"question_id":1105341,"title":"Modal window in Flash","body":"<p><strong>Short version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is it easy/feasible/possible to program modal window in Flash (AS3)? Is there a built-in functionality for it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m working on a Flash widget (in AS3), and I would like to be able to show a movie clip in a modal fashion. Essentially, I need a simple modal window inside the wieget. So far I learned that that I need to implement the \"modalness\" by myself (in AS3). There used to be something in previous versions of Flash and there is something in Flex, but I have not experience with Flax and I’m not sure what it involves.</p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to write it myself without any deep planning upfront and soon and hit some problems. It seems that the root of the problems is that I cannot keep a focus on a movie clip (or an <code>InteractiveObject</code> to be precise). I handle both <code>KEY_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> and <code>MOUSE_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> events while trying to prevent losing focus <code>FocusEvent.preventDefault()</code>. But I still manage to lose the focus by mouse clicking. What’s even weirder is that when I force the focus using the <code>Stage.focus</code> property, I get an ugly looking thick yellow line around my movie clip. In presumably indicates that the movie clips is focused, but normally it’s not anywhere. Does it mean that the object is not focusable, but I somehow force focus it anyway?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that the questions above are not very clear and I don’t expect to actually answer them. But what I’m trying to indicate is that it seems that I’m doing something wrong. So the main question is that: Is there an easy way to get a modal behaviour in Flash? I think programming it from scratch and piping and handling variously little events is something I should not be doing.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that is irritating me the most is that I need this modal widow to handle and display some edge case error messages. And so putting so much effort into it does not seem right. Maybe, there is a completely different way.</p>\n\n<p>I’m aware of the fact that the this question is not perhaps supported by enough research, but I started working on something which I thought would take me half an hour and it has already been several hours. I may do more systematic research and post more concrete questions later.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","fps","frame-rate"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":1,"question_id":13179424,"title":"Flash recommended Frame Rate - 2012","body":"<p>What is the recommended FPS(Frame rate) to use in flash applications?</p>\n\n<p>Both for games and for simple applications.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let's assume that even simple applications are yet flash applications and they do use animations.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","osmf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13248729,"title":"OSMF Media Player flicker.","body":"<p>Ive got a simple MediaPlayerSprite in a VideoPlayer class which is assigned a new media element each time a new video needs to be played but when I do this there is a white flicker on the screen before the new video is played. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried to create two players and hide the original until it is loaded and ready to play but this hasn't worked like I'd want it to. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas how I can avoid this white flicker?

The entire\ndemos folder is not included. There is a link to it on the main Red5 app page, but the link goes nowhere.\nI actually had to download a zip file with a previous version of Red5 in order to acquire the demos \nfolder. If someone at Red5 is reading this, could you please correct this oversight?</p></li>\n<li><p>There is some weird port- handling behavior when you run the server. When running the server, I get\nseveral JVM_Bind errors -- until I make changes to the ports in the red5.properties file. I have to\nchange the http.port entry and the jmx.rmi.port entry. Only by changing these ports do I seem to get the\nserver to run properly. What is really strange, though, is that I am running the server on a laptop\nwhich I periodically shut down. If I boot the laptop and run Red5 again, I get the JVM_Bind errors again!\nThis despite the fact that I am pointing it to different ports. I have found that I can then change back\nto the old port numbers and Red5 starts up without problems. So now on jmx.rmi.port I alternate between\nport 4444 and 9999. On http.port I alternate between Port 8080 and 8081. In any event, there appears to\nbe something in the server that somehow \"thinks\" that a previously used port is still in use. Some kind\nof cache? If so, is there any way to clear it so that I won't have to change ports all the time?</p></li>\n<li><p>Once I get the server running with the proper demos folder in place, the demos seem to work well -- as\nlong as I am running everything on the same machine. For some reason, however, the server does not \nrespond to http requests from other machines. This is clearly some kind of configuration issue, but the\ndocumentation that I have read so far dos not tell how to make Red5 handle requests from anywhere other\nthan localhost. I would like to run the demo apps on the same machine and other machines. Is there any\ndocumentation on how to make this so? Could someone tell me where that documentation is?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are the things I have seen so far with Red5.

Everything I have read so far about compiling to 11.4 works only in Flash Builder with Flex. I am searching for a way to compile to 11.4 using Flash Professional, but with no luck so far. Does anyone know of a plugin/command-line prompt/swc/... that I can use to accomplish this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","flash","video","video-streaming"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13109203,"title":"How to play flv stream videos on android","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10910637/android-play-flv-video-stream-from-url\">Android: play flv video stream from url</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to build a FLV stream video player for android which I can get control of the volume, play, pause and more.\nlike  RealPlayer and VLC Media Player does.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-2","instance","loader"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":12905098,"title":"As2 loading swf instance","body":"<p>I have a .swf which loads an external .swf:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.createEmptyMovieClip(\"container_mc\", this.getNextHighestDepth());\nvar my_listener:Object = new Object();\n\nmy_listener.onLoadComplete = function(target_mc:MovieClip) {\ntarget_mc._x = 50;\ntarget_mc._y = 50;\naddChild(my_loader);\n\n        var blocker = my_loader.content.test\n        blocker._visible = false;\n}\n\nmy_listener.onLoadProgress = function(target_mc:MovieClip) {\ntrace(target_mc.getBytesLoaded() + \" out of \" + target_mc.getBytesTotal());\n}\n\nvar my_loader:MovieClipLoader = new MovieClipLoader();\nmy_loader.addListener(my_listener);\nmy_loader.loadClip(\"child_as2.swf\", container_mc);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to acces the external swf and make the movieclip with instance name test visible = false;  but it won't work. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried a lot of codes and right now it throws me this error:</p>\n\n<p><code>Scene=Escena 1, layer=Capa 1, frame=1, Line 9  There is no property with the name 'content'.</code></p>\n\n<p>Any idea?</p>\n\n<p>If you have a better code i will thank you so much.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flex","flash","web-applications"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6992,"score":0,"question_id":4600550,"title":"Missing on-screen keyboard for Flash/Flex web application on Android?","body":"<p>I have an enterprise Flex web application, served up over https, that runs fine on Flash player 10.0 and beyond on a desktop computer/browser.  </p>\n\n<p>However, when I run it from my HTC Incredible with Android 2.2 the app loads fine, but there is no on-screen keyboard and so I cannot log in.

We will need to be able to run a large project with a team of 3-4 artists and 10+ programmers. We use Perforce source control system for storage of all code and assets. We need to be able to manage a project with multiple shared resources and multiple people (artists &amp; programmers) working on screens and controls.</p>\n\n<p>Our problem is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>We want to be able to create skinned graphical custom components, such as buttons, sliders, checkboxes as well as more complex controls such as tables and game specific elements.\nWe want to be able to share graphics assets in a single location and allow multiple artists and coders to work on shared components simultaneously. We need all of this to be stored in a Perforce source control repository.</p>\n\n<p>For AS3 code this is all fairly straight forward. It works like any other codebase and we have set up FlashBuilder and FlashDevelop projects.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the options seem to be as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a flash project or projects. The problem here is that all of the assets are copied into AuthortimeSharedAssts.fla. This means that, because FLA is a binary format, our source control cannot allow more than one person to edit any shared resource at the same time.</li>\n<li><p>Set up manual authortime sharing. This will allow work on multiple shared components because individuals can update a small discrete FLA file and this will automatically update a larger shared librar. The problem is that this does not allow sharing of graphics assets, which means that, if an artist updates a graphic, this does not filter down to individual flash files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the XFL format. This would allow us to merge files when checking in to source control as they are plain text and it saves out individual assets as separate files, which looks perfect. The problem is that I can't see how to make a project, which entirely uses XFL files (i.e. makes something like AuthortimeSharedAssets.xfl).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the moment I can't see any obvious, sensible way of running a large project  in Flash.

The issue is the child swf might also embed these fonts, but not explicitly so, meaning they are only embedded because there are fields in the child swf that use certain characters of a font. This means the text fields in the child use the incomplete embedded font instead of the embedded complete set that is registered in the parent or any level of grandparent. Also this means the swfs that may become children of this child won't get the complete font.</p>\n\n<p>My question:\nIs there any way to tell flash at compile to not embed, under any circumstances, fonts into a swf? If not is there a tool that removes embedded fonts from a compiled swf?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a few things I have given thought to/noticed so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It seems as if each Font class is tied to an ApplicationDomain. ( Confirmation of this would be helpful )</li>\n<li>Using device fonts on text fields will not cause any fonts to embed. ( Not an option for me however because I need the fields to embed fonts at runtime from a parent swf. )</li>\n<li>I can't find a way to unregister fonts or simply tell loaded child swfs to use parent fonts, which would be useful to apply to the loaded child swfs.</li>\n<li>It may be possible to load the child in a different context that would allow parent definitions of a fonts to override the child definitions. ( Or would there be two definitions and if so which one takes priority? )</li>\n<li>Loading assets from the library of the child and adding them to the stage will get the parent definition of the font. ( this makes sense because the asset is created outside the domain of the child )</li>\n<li>A possible solution might be to not add any characters to the textfields for compile of the swf, but this isn't really an option either because I need static text using any font.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've started forming a definition of what the problem is in my mind that may be incorrect, so please if necessary take a few steps back and give me a different perspective on the problem.

The dynamic text field is called 'dynamictext', and I've tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var externaltextload:URLLoader = new URLLoader( );\nexternaltextload.load(new URLRequest(\"text/Links.html\"));\nexternaltext.text=externaltextload.data;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<pre><code>var externaltextload:URLLoader = new URLLoader( );\nexternaltextload.load(new URLRequest(\"text/Links.html\"));\nexternaltext.htmlText=externaltextload.data;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm probably way off with this. Any help out there?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":0,"question_id":13052614,"title":"Forcing browsers to reload cached Flash files","body":"<p>How?

If I remove that VGroup (and all it's children), the transition plays fine.  Add it back in, and everything blows up again.  I tried using a VBox instead of a VGroup, but there was no change--same error.  I also tried getting rid of horizontalAlign=\"center\", and again, no change.</p>\n\n<p>Some further experimenting reveals that if I only have one child in the VGroup, then the transition works.  As soon as I get two children in the VGroup, however, it throws the error.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if I remove the VGroup completely and simply make the Labels direct children of the GridItem, it fails (same Invalid BitmapData error).  So it seems that perhaps the real culprit is having multiple controls at the same level in the control tree?  E.g., two controls work if they are in a linear parent-child relationship inside the GridItem (GridItem->VGroup->Label), but two labels at the same level (whether their immediate parent is the VGroup or the GridItem) causes the Invalid BitmapData error.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any other control I could use to accomplish what I'm trying to do with the Grid control, which is layout things in a table, with some cells that span into other rows or columns.  TileLayout would work if I didn't need to span into other rows and columns in a few cases.</p>\n\n<p>I've thought about using absolute positioning, but that will make it difficult (impossible?) to easily add/remove other controls into the \"grid,\" which is what I want to do.  When we're running subscription promotionals, we'll add text into certain cells noting how the promotional affects (or does not affect) that particular pricing option.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Here's what the grid looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:Grid id='membershipGrid' &gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"One Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Two Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"5 Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;!-- Comment out this VGroup, and everything works fine --&gt;\n           &lt;s:VGroup horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Monthly Autorenew\"  fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Payment plan option is not available\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"for multiple year memberhips.\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n           &lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Standard Membership\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardOneYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_ONE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardTwoYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_TWO_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardFiveYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_FIVE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"monthlyAutorenew\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.MONTHLY_AUTORENEW).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flash","webview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":25,"score":-2,"question_id":13038172,"title":"How to capture stream video in WebView?","body":"<p>My app has a WebView which loads html with ebedded flash video.\nIs threre any way to store flash stream into file?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","application-domain"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3742,"score":7,"question_id":4144270,"title":"AS3 - How to get ALL definitions in an ApplicationDomain of a loaded SWF?","body":"<p>When you load and SWF into another, the loader SWF can get definitions in the loaded SWF using <code>ApplicationDomain.getDefinition(name:String)</code> in example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package \n{\n    // ... imports\n\n    public class SWFLoader extends Sprite\n    {\n        private var loadedAppDomain:ApplicationDomain;\n\n        public function SWFLoader()\n        {\n            var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"test.swf\");\n            var loader:Loader = new Loader();\n            loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onTestLoadComplete);\n            loader.load(request);\n        }\n\n        private function onTestLoadComplete(event:Event):void\n        {\n            var loaderInfo:LoaderInfo = LoaderInfo(event.target);\n            loadedAppDomain = loaderInfo.applicationDomain;\n\n            // Here we can get ANY defined symbol (class, namespace or function according to Adobe Flash help)\n            var someSymbolClass:Class = Class(loadedAppDomain.getDefinition(\"SomeSymbol\"));\n            var someSymbolSprite:Sprite = Sprite(new someSymbolClass());\n\n            addChild(sprite);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, so how can I get ALL the definitions and not just ONE of them?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript","osmf"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13035248,"title":"OSMF: defining a start and endpoint for a VideoElement within a SerialElement","body":"<p>I have a MediaPlayer containing a SerialElement of two sequential videos, both 60 seconds, but only want to play from 04:00-20:00 of the first one, and from 02:00-08:00 of the second one. </p>\n\n<p>Right now I am waiting for the ability to seek to the first position (04:00), seeking &amp;

The instructor starts out with a rail yard that only has tracks, NO CARS or LOCOMOTIVES. Here's a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sTtcG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The instructor will have several objects below that map that he/she can drag and drop onto the rail yard to illustrate scenarios, here's a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RAP4R.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The objects are in my library and a single object is placed on the stage when the swf first runs. I have made an object array that has the linked name, x, and y coordinates of where I want the object to be placed when it's attached. Here is the object and loop to put item on the stage:</p>\n\n<p>There are a total of about 50 items, but this example will only show two.</p>\n\n<p>Object Array</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _objectArray = [{obj:{name:\"detector\",x:20,y:680}},{obj:{name:\"locomotive\",x:270,y:610}}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Attach Movie Loop</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* pulls objects from library and places on the stage */\nfor(var _i in _objectArray)\n{\n    var _name = String(_objectArray[_i].obj.name);\n    var _xx   = _objectArray[_i].obj.x;\n    var _yy   = _objectArray[_i].obj.y;\n    this.attachMovie(_name,_name,this.getNextHighestDepth(),{_x:_xx,_y:_yy});\n    this[_name].onRelease = function()\n    {\n        Clone(this);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the instructor starts building the scenario he/she will click on the object and it will place a duplicate of that object on the stage outside the object area. Then he/she can drag and drop that duplicate anywhere on the stage. In the for loop you can see I call the <code>Clone()</code> function, here that is:</p>\n\n<p>Clone Function</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _number:Number = 0;\nvar _cloneArray:Array = [];\nfunction Clone(_mc):Void\n{\n    var _clone = String(\"clone\" + _number);//used to make unique clone names\n    _cloneArray.push(_clone);//build array so I can remove objects from stage\n\n    /* duplicate objects */\n    _mc.duplicateMovieClip(_clone,100+_number,{y:580,_x:Stage.width/2});\n\n    /* set press event */\n    this[_clone].onPress = function()\n    {\n        this.swapDepths(10000);//bring to the top\n        this.startDrag(false,0,0,1024,580);//drag to constraints\n    }\n\n    /* set release event */\n    this[_clone].onRelease = function()\n    {\n        this.stopDrag();\n        if(_mc._name == \"loco\" || _mc._name == \"car\")\n        {\n            BuildTrain(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All this works great, but where I run into problems is when the instructor wants to \"build\" a train. So what I mean by that is, the instructor will place a locomotive on the stage, then place a tank car on the stage, the instructor will drag the tank car and drop it on top of the locomotive and the tank car will snap behind it the locomotive inline. When that happens the tank car will now follow the locomotive if the instructor wants to drag it somewhere. So it's like there are now one unit. This instructor could want 20 cars behind the locomotive ... and he might want to build more than one train. Here is a screenshot of a locomotive and car \"snapped\" together:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M3KaU.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Here's some code that allows me to snap the cars together, which works fine, but my problem is I can't drag the objects around as one unit after all the cars have been snapped:</p>\n\n<p>BuildTrain</p>\n\n<pre><code>function BuildTrain():Void\n{\n    for(var _i in _consistArray)\n    {\n        var _value = _consistArray[_i];\n        var _math  = _mc.width + this[_value]._width;\n        var _space = 1; // this is the space between cars\n        if(eval(_mc._droptarget)._name === _value)\n        {\n            _mc._x = this[_value]._x + _math / 2 + _space;\n            _mc._y = this[_value]._y;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>Clone()</code> does snap one car to the locomotive and car to car if you want to build a long train. Where the problem lies is I cannot figure out how to make them one unit after they are snapped. I thought about maybe building an array using a parent child relationship, but I'n not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a long post, but some background hopefully helped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm playing around with the idea that Amy had below since it seems logical that a child that resides inside a parent would just follow the parent. I managed to get one child - which is not enough, I need to be able to attach much much more - but I think this is the right path. I want to attach a car to the last car attached?

So it's quite possible that a user can draw a line with thickness <code>0.1</code> or <code>300.0</code>, and it looks that line possible thickness (in <code>Graphics.lineStyle()</code>) has upper border.

The whole reason I introduced the superclass Pin was to ensure that there was a pure one to one relationship between Pin and Geolocation objects rather than having a Geolocation be associated with either a User or a Person which would require the Geolocation table to have <code>user_id</code> and <code>place_id</code> columns, one of which would always be null. </p>\n\n<p>I was expecting every User to automatically have a <code>.geolocation</code> property, via the parent Pin class, which referred to a Geolocation but it seems like SQLAlchemy does not do this. How can I make subclassing relationships work to accomplish my goal of having User and Place and potentially other classes subclass Pin, have each of those classes have a geolocation property via Pin, and have a one to one relationship between a Pin and a Geolocation?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","firefox","upload"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":12961592,"title":"Flash uploader browse window out of focus","body":"<p>When i use flash for uploading file i click on it and it opens the open window to select file window always goes behind firefox window first time, then subsequent times it does not. \nAs soon as i restart browser first time click it goes to background again.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","player","mp4","mediaelement.js","fallback"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2036,"score":1,"question_id":6190831,"title":"Mediaelement.js malfunction in IE, no flashback works","body":"<p>I used the mediaelement.js in my site, i used for the example a .mp4 file with H.264 codec, works well in all browsers, but not works in any version of Internet explorer when i publish the site, on my localhost don't have any problem (the flash fallback works well) , but in my server don't works.</p>\n\n<p>The code the i used is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;VIDEO HTML5&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"player_files/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"player_files/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"player_files/mediaelementplayer.min.css\" rel=\"Stylesheet\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n\n&lt;video id=\"video1\" src=\"http://www.teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"http://www.teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n\n&lt;video width=\"640\" height=\"360\" id=\"video2\" poster=\"videos/precious.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\"&gt;\n    &lt;source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" /&gt;\n    &lt;source type=\"video/webm\" src=\"http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.webm\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;object width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"player_files/flashmediaelement.swf\"&gt;        \n        &lt;param name=\"movie\" value=\"player_files/flashmediaelement.swf\" /&gt; \n        &lt;param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"controls=true&amp;file=http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" /&gt;         \n\n        &lt;img src=\"player_files/precious.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" alt=\"Here we are\" title=\"No video playback capabilities\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;   \n&lt;/video&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>The player works in this direction \"http://www.teletica.com/html5\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","scripting","batch","png","export"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":12961381,"title":"Batch Export PNG Sequence from Adobe Flash FLA files","body":"<p>I found this script online to batch publish fla files, is it possible to change it to export png file sequences to the same directory?

In short, you've got to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTML 5 vs. HTML 4</li>\n<li>Large screens vs. small screens</li>\n<li>Touch-based input vs. mouse-based input</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, it's theoretically possible to build a single application that utilizes the latest in responsive design (to handle large AND small screens), utilizes the latest HTML 5 capabilities but degrades gracefully (to support the millions of users who are stuck on IE 6, 7, and 8), and somehow supports both touch input (huge hit areas, no hover/rollover behaviors, pinch-to-zoom, etc.) <strong>and</strong> mouse-based input.</p>\n\n<p>However, in my opinion, this requires a <strong>TON</strong> of additional code and is <strong>nightmarishly</strong> difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative - what I <em>generally</em> tend to recommend - is a Flash version for desktop users, and a <strong>HTML5/Touch</strong>-<em>only</em> version for mobile/iPad users.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>huge</strong> downside of this is that you've got two totally distinct sets of code. The upside is that you can create the optimal experience for both sets of users (i.e., you don't need to write code to support sub-optimal experiences for poor IE6/7/8 desktop users who are otherwise stuck with HTML4), and you can safely assume that mobile users are using a VERY current, VERY capable HTML5 compliant browser.</p>\n\n<p>Is my thinking correct?

You can even load in different flash movie clips through XML for the different animations. One of the features also allows you to flip an animation when you perform a certain action.

My current experience with Box2D is limited to creating a world, bodies and adding those bodies to the world in a functional manner.</p>\n\n<p>I'm finding it easy enough to integrate Box2D into my game environment, maintaining well-written code and have completed a few tutorials that walk through dealing with collisions. The issue that I'm facing now is that my game will have many bodies, each interacting with other bodies in different ways, and I'm finding it hard to write my own <code>b2ContactListener</code> subclass without it getting extremely messy.</p>\n\n<p>Based off a tutorial I used, I have created my own subclass of <code>b2ContactListener</code> and added an override of the <code>BeginContact()</code> method. The argument that <code>BeginContact()</code> receives when it is called will reference an instance of <code>b2Contact</code>, through which I can access two <code>b2Fixture</code> instances (the two instances that have collided). I am then able to access the <code>b2Body</code> instance associated with each of those <code>b2Fixture</code>s.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Currently I have a roundabout way of finding out what two things collided (i.e. whether they're a wall and a missile, or the player and a tree, etc) which uses <code>GetUserData()</code> and looks like this as an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var f1Player:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureA().GetBody().GetUserData() is Player\nvar f2Player:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureB().GetBody().GetUserData() is Player\nvar f1Tree:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureA().GetBody().GetUserData() is Tree\nvar f2Tree:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureB().GetBody().GetUserData() is Tree\n// ... continutes with all possible combinations.\n\n\n// Example of managing a collision:\nif(f1Player &amp;&amp; f2Tree)\n{\n    // Player (FixtureA) and Tree (FixtureB)\n}\n\nif(f2Player &amp;&amp; f1Tree)\n{\n    // Player (FixtureB) and Tree (FixtureA)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, this is going to end up extremely long and unmanageable. I also have to write each set of actions to perform twice to cater for a certain element being FixtureA or FixtureB, or vice versa (obviously in the form of a function call with the parameters swapped around rather than literally re-written).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is clearly not the correct approach, but I haven't been able to locate resources that more thoroughly explain collision detection management.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have experience with collision detection management using Box2D that they can share?

This approach translates\n  into a challenging problem – a P2P data exchange protocol that\n  can operate in churn rates where more than 90% of peers can\n  leave the overlay in under 10 seconds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there a public implementation of the code (or anything like it) available? I looked around and couldn't find anything, but it may be using a different name.</p></li>\n<li><p>The authors of the paper used a Java applet on the client. Now that Flash (sort of) has UDP support, would it be possible to do this part in Flash? Are there any known Flash implementations of distributed P2P web servers?</p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","flash-cs5"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":420,"score":0,"question_id":7599542,"title":"Flash CS5 won't execute AS3 code","body":"<p>I am getting a strange issue in Flash CS5.

The video did not play.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, for both devices, when pressing 'Load DRM Metadata' in the TVP, I received an 'Error #1009'.</p>\n\n<p>The SVP reported the Flash version as 10.2.164.128 for the NSZ-GT1, and 10.2.164.113 for the NSZ-GS7.</p>\n\n<p>For the second test, I used a locally built &amp; locally hosted OSMF sample player, version 1.5, configured with the example video from the Flash Access test site.</p>\n\n<p>As a reference I first tried a desktop PC browser flash plugin, and in this case I was presented with a prompt for the username and password; after entering these, the video played successfully.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I attempted this from the Chrome browser on both devices, although the OSMF player loaded I was never presented with the prompt for the username and password.</p>\n\n<p>Since there is no debug Flash player for Google TV, I was unable to investigate further with the device.</p>\n\n<p>Any clarification or insight into support for Flash Access on Google TV would be appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","css","image","actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":93,"score":1,"question_id":12735041,"title":"AS3: How to scale down multiple external html images in TextArea object's htmlText?","body":"<p>I'm new to AS3, and last touched Flash when it was with Macromedia, version 4.</p>\n\n<p>I'm building a flashapp to display images via html data.\nThe data is populated in a <code>TextArea</code> object via <code>htmlText</code> property.\nThe <code>TextArea</code> container has a fixed width and height;</p>\n\n<p>In the html data, I have multiple <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags referencing external images.\nHowever, the problem arise when the image referenced is larger than the <code>TextArea</code> dimensions.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import fl.controls.TextArea;\n\nvar box:*;\n\nbox = TextArea();\nbox.htmlText = \"External HTML Data with multiple &lt;img src='elsewhere.jpg'&gt; tags\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The images within the external data does not have any <code>id</code> attributes in it. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried css styling with the styleSheet property, but flash only supports a subset of CSS1 specs.\n<a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/StyleSheet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/StyleSheet.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So css <code>max-width</code> is nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>The closest possible solution I've read about, uses <code>getImageReference</code> method\n<a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/TextField.html#getImageReference%28%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/TextField.html#getImageReference()</a>\nfrom TextField object.</p>\n\n<p>This method requires the image in the image to be first loaded, then be called by <code>getImageReference</code> via <code>id</code> attribute to get a <code>DisplayObject</code> which then can be manipulated.</p>\n\n<p>From here, it seems that I would need to get a <code>string.match</code> method on the external data to match and insert different <code>id</code> attribute for each <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.

I am deep into development.</p>\n\n<p>This morning one of my testers reported seeing a flex based popup that I did not create.</p>\n\n<p>I am not able to post pictures here but to describe the popup - It has a grey header-bar with a small close button which looks more like a flex panel. As far as I'm aware this is not part of the standard flex popup. It then has a question mark image in the top left corner of the main window. I believe this is the stand in graphic that flex uses when it tried to load an image but can't. At the bottom of the popup is a text input box which is pre-filled with an IP address. The address is the same for both myself and the tester. Finally at the very bottom is an OK and a Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The buttons are styled because I set a global button skin for my app. Other than that I did not create this popup and cannot find any evidence of it in my scripts.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately fired up the same build that I have on my own iPad. I had tested it before sending out and had not seen any evidence of this before but when I tested it this morning, I too saw this popup. It seems to have literally occurred overnight.</p>\n\n<p>I did some more testing and have discovered that if I turn off all internet connections then the app won't even start. It hangs at the splash screen. I can't be certain about this build but I know that previous builds have most definitely worked offline.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched all through my scripts for something that might cause this. I am not using any reference libraries beyond the standard ones and I'm not using any ANE's. I have also checked other Flex apps that I am working on but they all seem fine.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else come across this before?

I will have x number of tickers that count up to a value that increment (every time when my timer fires, for example every 100ms), for example the value can be \"1.03\", and next time the timer fire it can be something like \"1.14\". I split this number into three \"columns\"=tickers and each ticker will have it value;\nticker1: 1\nticker2: 1\nticker3: 4</p>\n\n<p>When ticker3 get next \"0\"-value = 10, ticker2 should update to \"2\" and so on.\nThe problem is to make the numbers scroll so if the number was \"4\" the first time, and next time it is \"2\", it should actually scroll through all the numbers between that and so on, and not jump back up with that row.</p>\n\n<p>So if i for example stop the tickers at value \"1.14\", that should be the value the tickers stop at.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: CODE</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>package gui {\nimport flash.events.Event;\nimport com.greensock.TweenMax;\nimport com.greensock.easing.Linear;\nimport com.greensock.TweenLite;\n\nimport flash.display.MovieClip;\nimport flash.display.Sprite;\n\npublic class Ticker extends Sprite {\n\n    public var windowBg_mc:MovieClip;\n\n    private var _stepValue:int = 0;\n\n    public var row1:MovieClip;\n    public var row2:MovieClip;\n    private var _activeRow:MovieClip;\n\n    public var stopBtn:MovieClip;\n\n    public function Ticker() {\n        init(0);\n    }\n\n    private function init(val:int):void{\n\n        this.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, updateConnection);\n\n        _stepValue = val;\n\n        TweenMax.to(row2, 0, {tint: 0xff0000});\n\n        _activeRow = row1;\n\n        var yMoveTarget_num:Number = -(Number(_stepValue) * 34);\n\n        TweenLite.to(_activeRow, 5, {y: yMoveTarget_num, ease: Linear.easeNone});\n\n        updateConnection(null);\n    }\n\n    private function updateConnection(e:Event):void{\n\n        if(_activeRow.y &lt;= -342){\n            _activeRow.y = 340;\n            if( _activeRow == row1 ){\n                _activeRow = row2;\n            }else{\n                _activeRow = row1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if( _activeRow == row1 ){\n            row2.y = row1.y + 340;\n        }else{\n            row1.y = row2.y + 340;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public function tick(inpValue:int):void{\n\n        if(_stepValue == inpValue) return;\n\n        var oldValue : int = _stepValue;\n        _stepValue = inpValue;\n\n        if( _stepValue &lt; oldValue ){\n            //target must be change here\n        }\n\n        var yMoveTarget_num:Number = -(Number(_stepValue) * 34);\n        TweenLite.to(_activeRow, .4, {y: yMoveTarget_num, ease: Linear.easeIn});\n    }\n\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And \"tick\" is the method that gets called every 100ms.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","html5","video","html5-video","mediaelement.js"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":437,"score":0,"question_id":5130017,"title":"How do I stop my mediaelement.js player from downloading when it is paused/stopped?","body":"<p><strong>I have a video player on my site that once paused I would like to prevent rest of the video being downloaded.</strong> I am using <a href=\"http://mediaelementjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MediaElement.js</a> for html5 video with flash fallback.

This means:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Setting the best quality given the available bandwidth when the chat starts</li>\n<li>Responding to network congestions during chat by decreasing the quality.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The task is similar to <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/dynstream_advanced_pt1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dynamic stream switching</a>, but P2P has its specifics that make dynamic streaming approaches not work. For example, the maxBytesPerSecond metric monitored in dynamic stream switching is pretty useless in P2P where the receiving NetStream's buffer size is set to 0 to minimize latency.</p>\n\n<p>So far, it looks like the most reliable QoS metric for P2P is SRTT. In my simulated tests on a local network, a bandwidth congestion makes it shot up to 500 ms and more when there's a bandwidth limit introduced. However, it gives no hint as to how best adjust the value for <code>bandwidth</code> in <code>Camera.setQuality(0, bandwidth)</code> to respond to the congestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've done lots of experiments, and I still don't see a clear and simple solution to the problem. I'm also wondering how this issue is addressed (if at all) in other RTMFP chat solutions.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flash","air","adobe","multiscreen"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":97,"score":2,"question_id":12672423,"title":"How to Multi-Screen android tablet application on Adobe AIR and Flash Professional","body":"<p>I have done app in ipad with Adobe AIR thats work fine in ipad,</p>\n\n<p>but now i have to create android tablet app for multiscreen resolution like this,</p>\n\n<p>2560*1600, 1366*768, 1280*800, 1280*768, 1024*768, 1024*600, 960*640, 960*540, 854*480, 800*600, 800*480, 800*400</p>\n\n<p>and my current .fla file resolution is 1024*768 so how can i create android tablet app with multi-screen?</p>\n\n<p>thanks </p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","flash","flex","video","inline"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12674837,"title":"Inline Video Player in Facebook Bug","body":"<p>I have created a player its in early stages though, but I need to play the videos inside Facebook timeline like youtube does.

This works fine for URLs with no special characters (by either setting the <code>source</code> property or calling <code>load()</code> on <code>Image</code>). However, when a URL is submitted that has special characters which have already been escaped, i.e. in most cases simply copied directly from the URL bar in a browser, <code>URLRequest</code> escapes the percent signs again with '%25', which makes the URL invalid and the server returns an error. Pasting the same URL in a browser loads the image just fine though. I've tried <code>decodeURI()</code> on the URL, but that ignores a large set of characters, so I tried <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>, and that decodes everything correctly, but when <code>URLRequest</code> goes to re-encode it, it ignores the now-decoded special characters and doesn't escape them, so in this case the URL is not valid, because it still has unsafe characters in it and fails. So, how can I send <code>URLRequest</code> something with special characters in it (encoded or unencoded) and have it actually work? Really, I wish it didn't do anything with my URL and let me determine if it's valid or not, but it's embedded in the Flash Player globals swc and is therefore the closed-source piece of flash and I can't see the source code.

The canvas refresh lag is noticeable around 5 symbols deep, and can become atrocious beyond that.

It was developed in flash Cs5 actionscript 3. Since sometimes faces can strafe in front or behind other faces, we developed a concept solution that consists in creating a mask for each face so that it may hide the face whenever it is behind aother face. This would be achieved by creating a mask láyer with a rectangle shape, and whenever an overlap would occur, we would just create a keyframe and carve out the shape to hide. It seemed time consuming yet simple so we started working only to find out that it is not so simple and that flash pretty much s</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>List item</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>tinks (thanks for nothing adobe!!!)</p>\n\n<p>Turnos out the code dynamic effect is somehow broken by the mask, so we learned later that we must turn the mask into a movieclip and dynamicslly apply the mask, so we rewrote the code and applied the mask dynamicslly with as3 standard code:</p>\n\n<p>face.mask = mask_mc;</p>\n\n<p>so we try out and everything seems Ok... Except...that the F#$¿iNG MASK FLICKERS!!! Flashes!!! Shows and hides!! One frame shows, hides on the next!! The result is horrible!!

We have searched googled all over the Internet and there is no mention of this flicker bug thing, 8 hours carving holes on Shapes for nothing!!!! </p>\n\n<p>So here is the question: How... OHHHH... How Do i avoid the mask from flickering? What can i do to fin this and not lo ose my work? Any help is appreciated, it has Been weeks now and we are running out of options!!</p>\n\n<p>And i would also like to dedicate this question to adobe for falsely Expecting their tool to do what it was supposed to do! May they post a request asking for what they can do with the liscense money so i may tell them where they can stuff it!!!</p>\n"}]}
