On selecting login in the flash file it opens another window (namely the Facebook login popup). Facebook client based login flow is used to log the user in and the user_id obtained from this is sent to django server for identification and logging in.\nI have verified on the server that at this stage, authenticate and login function of django.contrib.auth are called and user.is_authenticated() returns True.</p>\n\n<p>But on the client side in the original window containing the Flash file, the user sometimes remains AnonymouseUser i.e. not logged in. At other times, the user is identified correctly.</p>\n\n<p>On checking the database entries for current sessions, I see that when the user does not get logged in, there are two sessions present, whereas when the user gets logged in there is only one session.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure why one extra session gets created and how to remedy this.</p>\n\n<p>Note - I am using a custom authentication Backend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\nI dug into the django system to see what was happening.\nDjango has a mechanism to change the key for a session while maintaining the data.\nWhat happens in my case is that the change in session key takes place twice. Once it occurs as expected during the login. But immediately following this, another request causes the session key to change. This request is not made by me in my client code. \nIt seems the request is for /favicon.ico\nNot sure where this originates from. Any help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>\nIt definitely seems related to favicon.ico\nNow that I am serving it at root, things function properly after a few refreshes. I think that the problem occured previously as the browser's request for favicon was messing up the session, when it was failing. I will test some more before confirming and closing this issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>\nNot solved. I would really appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.\nUntil then I will see if I can change the login flow to bypass this mechanism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong>\nSo after going through some stack traces(which I can share if required), I realized the following. Since Django changes a session id when logging in a user, it creates a situation where one session id gives rise to two session ids as follows.\nRequest 1 - An ajax request causing the login. This request has the session key previously provided by django, say key1. In response the server sends back a new session key, say key2 while deleting key1 from its memory (in my case database)\nRequest 2 - This is the implicit request that is made by the browser after the Request 1 for favicon.ico. (As you might know this request is made by the browser and I cannot control it)\nThis request also comes with the sam original key namely, key1. Since this key is not available in the memory for Django, it creates a new key, key3 and sends back in the  response.</p>\n\n<p>As a result all further requests are made with key3, which django identifies with a new session and the logged in state stored with key2 is lost.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure whether this is a bug in Django or if this is the intended behavior.\nBut if this is an intended behavior it will create problems when any client makes multiple ajax requests before waiting for previous response and the key-change is triggered.</p>\n\n<p>Having said this, my original problem remains and I will post a solution if and when I find one.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13296580,"title":"Bitmapdata blendmode and alpha","body":"<p>Is there anyway to apply both alpha and BlendMode.HardLight when drawing using bitmapdata?</p>\n\n<pre><code>var processImageBmd:BitmapData=new BitmapData(900,900);\nprocessImageBmd.draw(backgroundImage);  //backgroundImage is a sprite                               \n\nprocessImageBmd.draw(frontImage,null,null,BlendMode.HARDLIGHT);//frontImage is a sprite\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically I need to apply alpha (let's say alpha = 0.4) and BlendMode.HardLight to frontImage.

The movie stops on frame 1 of the main timeline with the card showing, no sound, as expected. Now I use \".\" to move the play head forward one frame at a time. No problem. I see the frames after the first frame. Still no sound, as expected. So far so good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem starts</strong> when I use \",\" to move the play head backward, the sound in the Card MC starts to play, regardless where the play head is, even when the Game MC (thence the Card MC) is not on the stage. Worse, each press of \",\" will trigger another start of the same sound overlapping with the previous one. And the sound would continue in loops until I close the swf. </p>\n\n<p><strong>However,</strong> the problem will not occur if I place the Card MC directly on the main timeline. It only occurs when it is inside another movie clip (Game MC). </p>\n\n<p>I need to solve this problem because the full version of the flash card game is to be placed in an HTML page with a javascript based play control, which allows the viewer to jump around in the swf timeline.   </p>\n\n<p>The fla file is at: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_5mgotjr4l5RDZaOGxFeFFWN1U/edit?pli=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_5mgotjr4l5RDZaOGxFeFFWN1U/edit?pli=1</a></p>\n\n<p>Any insight will be greatly appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Keith</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","flash"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13280734,"title":"Dynamically add javascript slideshow code to header of templated site","body":"<p>I am working with a very outdated templated site that does not let me change anything in the top portion of the site.

This theme is very complex. It heavily uses javascript it has a 700 code lines long javascript file, called <em>custom.js</em>, which manages the whole website using AJAX. For this reason i couldn't include the js code to load the Jplayer into the .php page file, but i needed to put it into a separate js file and call this file from <em>custom.js</em>.\nSo, into <em>custom.js</em> i added the following lines, which include into the page  my file named <em>chiama-player.js</em>.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var html_doc = document.getElementsByTagName('head').item(0);\nvar js = document.createElement('script');\njs.setAttribute('language', 'javascript');\njs.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');\njs.setAttribute('src', \"/wp-content/themes/Gleam/chiama-player.js\");\nhtml_doc.appendChild(js);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The file named <em>chiama-player.js</em> contains the code to instatiate the jPlayer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {\nif(window.location.href==\"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/#!/le-canzoni/\" || window.location.href==\"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/le-canzoni/\"){\n    $(\"#jp_container_1\").css( { 'display': 'block' } );\n    $(\"#jquery_jplayer_1\").jPlayer( {\n        ready: function () {\n            $(this).jPlayer(\"setMedia\", {\n                m4a: \"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/wp-content/themes/Gleam/shakeit.m4a\",\n            });\n        },\n        swfPath: \"http://www.ordinarypeopleofficial.com/wp-content/themes/Gleam/jplayer\",\n        supplied: \"m4a\"\n    });\n}\nelse{\n    $(\"#jp_container_1\").css( { 'display': 'none' } );\n}\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>THE PROBLEM:\nEverything works GREAT on the browsers who support m4a. This means i correctly included the code to load the jPlayer.\nThe problem comes with Firefox. Firefox does not support m4a, so it needs the flash fallback to work. When i try to load the page on Firefox i see that the swfPath is correctly recognized (in fact if i alter the path and i type some random text, i see a 404 in the FireBug Net window). The problem is that the request\n\"GET Jplayer.swf\"\nnever gets a result and keeps loading for hours without getting the file.

Has anyone ran into such a problem where the page content gets garbled, but, resizing the browser window fixes it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3211,"score":1,"question_id":1105341,"title":"Modal window in Flash","body":"<p><strong>Short version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is it easy/feasible/possible to program modal window in Flash (AS3)? Is there a built-in functionality for it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m working on a Flash widget (in AS3), and I would like to be able to show a movie clip in a modal fashion. Essentially, I need a simple modal window inside the wieget. So far I learned that that I need to implement the \"modalness\" by myself (in AS3). There used to be something in previous versions of Flash and there is something in Flex, but I have not experience with Flax and I’m not sure what it involves.</p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to write it myself without any deep planning upfront and soon and hit some problems. It seems that the root of the problems is that I cannot keep a focus on a movie clip (or an <code>InteractiveObject</code> to be precise). I handle both <code>KEY_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> and <code>MOUSE_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> events while trying to prevent losing focus <code>FocusEvent.preventDefault()</code>. But I still manage to lose the focus by mouse clicking. What’s even weirder is that when I force the focus using the <code>Stage.focus</code> property, I get an ugly looking thick yellow line around my movie clip. In presumably indicates that the movie clips is focused, but normally it’s not anywhere. Does it mean that the object is not focusable, but I somehow force focus it anyway?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that the questions above are not very clear and I don’t expect to actually answer them. But what I’m trying to indicate is that it seems that I’m doing something wrong. So the main question is that: Is there an easy way to get a modal behaviour in Flash? I think programming it from scratch and piping and handling variously little events is something I should not be doing.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that is irritating me the most is that I need this modal widow to handle and display some edge case error messages. And so putting so much effort into it does not seem right. Maybe, there is a completely different way.</p>\n\n<p>I’m aware of the fact that the this question is not perhaps supported by enough research, but I started working on something which I thought would take me half an hour and it has already been several hours. I may do more systematic research and post more concrete questions later.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","fps","frame-rate"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":1,"question_id":13179424,"title":"Flash recommended Frame Rate - 2012","body":"<p>What is the recommended FPS(Frame rate) to use in flash applications?</p>\n\n<p>Both for games and for simple applications.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let's assume that even simple applications are yet flash applications and they do use animations.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","osmf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13248729,"title":"OSMF Media Player flicker.","body":"<p>Ive got a simple MediaPlayerSprite in a VideoPlayer class which is assigned a new media element each time a new video needs to be played but when I do this there is a white flicker on the screen before the new video is played. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried to create two players and hide the original until it is loaded and ready to play but this hasn't worked like I'd want it to. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas how I can avoid this white flicker?

The entire\ndemos folder is not included. There is a link to it on the main Red5 app page, but the link goes nowhere.\nI actually had to download a zip file with a previous version of Red5 in order to acquire the demos \nfolder. If someone at Red5 is reading this, could you please correct this oversight?</p></li>\n<li><p>There is some weird port- handling behavior when you run the server. When running the server, I get\nseveral JVM_Bind errors -- until I make changes to the ports in the red5.properties file. I have to\nchange the http.port entry and the jmx.rmi.port entry. Only by changing these ports do I seem to get the\nserver to run properly. What is really strange, though, is that I am running the server on a laptop\nwhich I periodically shut down. If I boot the laptop and run Red5 again, I get the JVM_Bind errors again!\nThis despite the fact that I am pointing it to different ports. I have found that I can then change back\nto the old port numbers and Red5 starts up without problems. So now on jmx.rmi.port I alternate between\nport 4444 and 9999. On http.port I alternate between Port 8080 and 8081. In any event, there appears to\nbe something in the server that somehow \"thinks\" that a previously used port is still in use. Some kind\nof cache? If so, is there any way to clear it so that I won't have to change ports all the time?</p></li>\n<li><p>Once I get the server running with the proper demos folder in place, the demos seem to work well -- as\nlong as I am running everything on the same machine. For some reason, however, the server does not \nrespond to http requests from other machines. This is clearly some kind of configuration issue, but the\ndocumentation that I have read so far dos not tell how to make Red5 handle requests from anywhere other\nthan localhost. I would like to run the demo apps on the same machine and other machines. Is there any\ndocumentation on how to make this so? Could someone tell me where that documentation is?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are the things I have seen so far with Red5.

Everything I have read so far about compiling to 11.4 works only in Flash Builder with Flex. I am searching for a way to compile to 11.4 using Flash Professional, but with no luck so far. Does anyone know of a plugin/command-line prompt/swc/... that I can use to accomplish this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","flash","video","video-streaming"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13109203,"title":"How to play flv stream videos on android","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10910637/android-play-flv-video-stream-from-url\">Android: play flv video stream from url</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to build a FLV stream video player for android which I can get control of the volume, play, pause and more.\nlike  RealPlayer and VLC Media Player does.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-2","instance","loader"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":1,"question_id":12905098,"title":"As2 loading swf instance","body":"<p>I have a .swf which loads an external .swf:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.createEmptyMovieClip(\"container_mc\", this.getNextHighestDepth());\nvar my_listener:Object = new Object();\n\nmy_listener.onLoadComplete = function(target_mc:MovieClip) {\ntarget_mc._x = 50;\ntarget_mc._y = 50;\naddChild(my_loader);\n\n        var blocker = my_loader.content.test\n        blocker._visible = false;\n}\n\nmy_listener.onLoadProgress = function(target_mc:MovieClip) {\ntrace(target_mc.getBytesLoaded() + \" out of \" + target_mc.getBytesTotal());\n}\n\nvar my_loader:MovieClipLoader = new MovieClipLoader();\nmy_loader.addListener(my_listener);\nmy_loader.loadClip(\"child_as2.swf\", container_mc);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to acces the external swf and make the movieclip with instance name test visible = false;  but it won't work. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried a lot of codes and right now it throws me this error:</p>\n\n<p><code>Scene=Escena 1, layer=Capa 1, frame=1, Line 9  There is no property with the name 'content'.</code></p>\n\n<p>Any idea?</p>\n\n<p>If you have a better code i will thank you so much.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flex","flash","web-applications"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7002,"score":0,"question_id":4600550,"title":"Missing on-screen keyboard for Flash/Flex web application on Android?","body":"<p>I have an enterprise Flex web application, served up over https, that runs fine on Flash player 10.0 and beyond on a desktop computer/browser.  </p>\n\n<p>However, when I run it from my HTC Incredible with Android 2.2 the app loads fine, but there is no on-screen keyboard and so I cannot log in.

We will need to be able to run a large project with a team of 3-4 artists and 10+ programmers. We use Perforce source control system for storage of all code and assets. We need to be able to manage a project with multiple shared resources and multiple people (artists &amp; programmers) working on screens and controls.</p>\n\n<p>Our problem is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>We want to be able to create skinned graphical custom components, such as buttons, sliders, checkboxes as well as more complex controls such as tables and game specific elements.\nWe want to be able to share graphics assets in a single location and allow multiple artists and coders to work on shared components simultaneously. We need all of this to be stored in a Perforce source control repository.</p>\n\n<p>For AS3 code this is all fairly straight forward. It works like any other codebase and we have set up FlashBuilder and FlashDevelop projects.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the options seem to be as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a flash project or projects. The problem here is that all of the assets are copied into AuthortimeSharedAssts.fla. This means that, because FLA is a binary format, our source control cannot allow more than one person to edit any shared resource at the same time.</li>\n<li><p>Set up manual authortime sharing. This will allow work on multiple shared components because individuals can update a small discrete FLA file and this will automatically update a larger shared librar. The problem is that this does not allow sharing of graphics assets, which means that, if an artist updates a graphic, this does not filter down to individual flash files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the XFL format. This would allow us to merge files when checking in to source control as they are plain text and it saves out individual assets as separate files, which looks perfect. The problem is that I can't see how to make a project, which entirely uses XFL files (i.e. makes something like AuthortimeSharedAssets.xfl).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the moment I can't see any obvious, sensible way of running a large project  in Flash.

The issue is the child swf might also embed these fonts, but not explicitly so, meaning they are only embedded because there are fields in the child swf that use certain characters of a font. This means the text fields in the child use the incomplete embedded font instead of the embedded complete set that is registered in the parent or any level of grandparent. Also this means the swfs that may become children of this child won't get the complete font.</p>\n\n<p>My question:\nIs there any way to tell flash at compile to not embed, under any circumstances, fonts into a swf? If not is there a tool that removes embedded fonts from a compiled swf?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a few things I have given thought to/noticed so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It seems as if each Font class is tied to an ApplicationDomain. ( Confirmation of this would be helpful )</li>\n<li>Using device fonts on text fields will not cause any fonts to embed. ( Not an option for me however because I need the fields to embed fonts at runtime from a parent swf. )</li>\n<li>I can't find a way to unregister fonts or simply tell loaded child swfs to use parent fonts, which would be useful to apply to the loaded child swfs.</li>\n<li>It may be possible to load the child in a different context that would allow parent definitions of a fonts to override the child definitions. ( Or would there be two definitions and if so which one takes priority? )</li>\n<li>Loading assets from the library of the child and adding them to the stage will get the parent definition of the font. ( this makes sense because the asset is created outside the domain of the child )</li>\n<li>A possible solution might be to not add any characters to the textfields for compile of the swf, but this isn't really an option either because I need static text using any font.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've started forming a definition of what the problem is in my mind that may be incorrect, so please if necessary take a few steps back and give me a different perspective on the problem.

If I remove that VGroup (and all it's children), the transition plays fine.  Add it back in, and everything blows up again.  I tried using a VBox instead of a VGroup, but there was no change--same error.  I also tried getting rid of horizontalAlign=\"center\", and again, no change.</p>\n\n<p>Some further experimenting reveals that if I only have one child in the VGroup, then the transition works.  As soon as I get two children in the VGroup, however, it throws the error.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if I remove the VGroup completely and simply make the Labels direct children of the GridItem, it fails (same Invalid BitmapData error).  So it seems that perhaps the real culprit is having multiple controls at the same level in the control tree?  E.g., two controls work if they are in a linear parent-child relationship inside the GridItem (GridItem->VGroup->Label), but two labels at the same level (whether their immediate parent is the VGroup or the GridItem) causes the Invalid BitmapData error.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any other control I could use to accomplish what I'm trying to do with the Grid control, which is layout things in a table, with some cells that span into other rows or columns.  TileLayout would work if I didn't need to span into other rows and columns in a few cases.</p>\n\n<p>I've thought about using absolute positioning, but that will make it difficult (impossible?) to easily add/remove other controls into the \"grid,\" which is what I want to do.  When we're running subscription promotionals, we'll add text into certain cells noting how the promotional affects (or does not affect) that particular pricing option.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Here's what the grid looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:Grid id='membershipGrid' &gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"One Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Two Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"5 Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;!-- Comment out this VGroup, and everything works fine --&gt;\n           &lt;s:VGroup horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Monthly Autorenew\"  fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Payment plan option is not available\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"for multiple year memberhips.\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n           &lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Standard Membership\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardOneYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_ONE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardTwoYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_TWO_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardFiveYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_FIVE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"monthlyAutorenew\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.MONTHLY_AUTORENEW).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flash","webview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":26,"score":-2,"question_id":13038172,"title":"How to capture stream video in WebView?","body":"<p>My app has a WebView which loads html with ebedded flash video.\nIs threre any way to store flash stream into file?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","application-domain"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3747,"score":7,"question_id":4144270,"title":"AS3 - How to get ALL definitions in an ApplicationDomain of a loaded SWF?","body":"<p>When you load and SWF into another, the loader SWF can get definitions in the loaded SWF using <code>ApplicationDomain.getDefinition(name:String)</code> in example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package \n{\n    // ... imports\n\n    public class SWFLoader extends Sprite\n    {\n        private var loadedAppDomain:ApplicationDomain;\n\n        public function SWFLoader()\n        {\n            var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"test.swf\");\n            var loader:Loader = new Loader();\n            loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onTestLoadComplete);\n            loader.load(request);\n        }\n\n        private function onTestLoadComplete(event:Event):void\n        {\n            var loaderInfo:LoaderInfo = LoaderInfo(event.target);\n            loadedAppDomain = loaderInfo.applicationDomain;\n\n            // Here we can get ANY defined symbol (class, namespace or function according to Adobe Flash help)\n            var someSymbolClass:Class = Class(loadedAppDomain.getDefinition(\"SomeSymbol\"));\n            var someSymbolSprite:Sprite = Sprite(new someSymbolClass());\n\n            addChild(sprite);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, so how can I get ALL the definitions and not just ONE of them?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript","osmf"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":13035248,"title":"OSMF: defining a start and endpoint for a VideoElement within a SerialElement","body":"<p>I have a MediaPlayer containing a SerialElement of two sequential videos, both 60 seconds, but only want to play from 04:00-20:00 of the first one, and from 02:00-08:00 of the second one. </p>\n\n<p>Right now I am waiting for the ability to seek to the first position (04:00), seeking &amp;

The instructor starts out with a rail yard that only has tracks, NO CARS or LOCOMOTIVES. Here's a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sTtcG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The instructor will have several objects below that map that he/she can drag and drop onto the rail yard to illustrate scenarios, here's a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RAP4R.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The objects are in my library and a single object is placed on the stage when the swf first runs. I have made an object array that has the linked name, x, and y coordinates of where I want the object to be placed when it's attached. Here is the object and loop to put item on the stage:</p>\n\n<p>There are a total of about 50 items, but this example will only show two.</p>\n\n<p>Object Array</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _objectArray = [{obj:{name:\"detector\",x:20,y:680}},{obj:{name:\"locomotive\",x:270,y:610}}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Attach Movie Loop</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* pulls objects from library and places on the stage */\nfor(var _i in _objectArray)\n{\n    var _name = String(_objectArray[_i].obj.name);\n    var _xx   = _objectArray[_i].obj.x;\n    var _yy   = _objectArray[_i].obj.y;\n    this.attachMovie(_name,_name,this.getNextHighestDepth(),{_x:_xx,_y:_yy});\n    this[_name].onRelease = function()\n    {\n        Clone(this);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the instructor starts building the scenario he/she will click on the object and it will place a duplicate of that object on the stage outside the object area. Then he/she can drag and drop that duplicate anywhere on the stage. In the for loop you can see I call the <code>Clone()</code> function, here that is:</p>\n\n<p>Clone Function</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _number:Number = 0;\nvar _cloneArray:Array = [];\nfunction Clone(_mc):Void\n{\n    var _clone = String(\"clone\" + _number);//used to make unique clone names\n    _cloneArray.push(_clone);//build array so I can remove objects from stage\n\n    /* duplicate objects */\n    _mc.duplicateMovieClip(_clone,100+_number,{y:580,_x:Stage.width/2});\n\n    /* set press event */\n    this[_clone].onPress = function()\n    {\n        this.swapDepths(10000);//bring to the top\n        this.startDrag(false,0,0,1024,580);//drag to constraints\n    }\n\n    /* set release event */\n    this[_clone].onRelease = function()\n    {\n        this.stopDrag();\n        if(_mc._name == \"loco\" || _mc._name == \"car\")\n        {\n            BuildTrain(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All this works great, but where I run into problems is when the instructor wants to \"build\" a train. So what I mean by that is, the instructor will place a locomotive on the stage, then place a tank car on the stage, the instructor will drag the tank car and drop it on top of the locomotive and the tank car will snap behind it the locomotive inline. When that happens the tank car will now follow the locomotive if the instructor wants to drag it somewhere. So it's like there are now one unit. This instructor could want 20 cars behind the locomotive ... and he might want to build more than one train. Here is a screenshot of a locomotive and car \"snapped\" together:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M3KaU.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Here's some code that allows me to snap the cars together, which works fine, but my problem is I can't drag the objects around as one unit after all the cars have been snapped:</p>\n\n<p>BuildTrain</p>\n\n<pre><code>function BuildTrain():Void\n{\n    for(var _i in _consistArray)\n    {\n        var _value = _consistArray[_i];\n        var _math  = _mc.width + this[_value]._width;\n        var _space = 1; // this is the space between cars\n        if(eval(_mc._droptarget)._name === _value)\n        {\n            _mc._x = this[_value]._x + _math / 2 + _space;\n            _mc._y = this[_value]._y;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>Clone()</code> does snap one car to the locomotive and car to car if you want to build a long train. Where the problem lies is I cannot figure out how to make them one unit after they are snapped. I thought about maybe building an array using a parent child relationship, but I'n not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a long post, but some background hopefully helped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm playing around with the idea that Amy had below since it seems logical that a child that resides inside a parent would just follow the parent. I managed to get one child - which is not enough, I need to be able to attach much much more - but I think this is the right path. I want to attach a car to the last car attached?

So it's quite possible that a user can draw a line with thickness <code>0.1</code> or <code>300.0</code>, and it looks that line possible thickness (in <code>Graphics.lineStyle()</code>) has upper border.

The whole reason I introduced the superclass Pin was to ensure that there was a pure one to one relationship between Pin and Geolocation objects rather than having a Geolocation be associated with either a User or a Person which would require the Geolocation table to have <code>user_id</code> and <code>place_id</code> columns, one of which would always be null. </p>\n\n<p>I was expecting every User to automatically have a <code>.geolocation</code> property, via the parent Pin class, which referred to a Geolocation but it seems like SQLAlchemy does not do this. How can I make subclassing relationships work to accomplish my goal of having User and Place and potentially other classes subclass Pin, have each of those classes have a geolocation property via Pin, and have a one to one relationship between a Pin and a Geolocation?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","firefox","upload"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":12961592,"title":"Flash uploader browse window out of focus","body":"<p>When i use flash for uploading file i click on it and it opens the open window to select file window always goes behind firefox window first time, then subsequent times it does not. \nAs soon as i restart browser first time click it goes to background again.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","player","mp4","mediaelement.js","fallback"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2045,"score":1,"question_id":6190831,"title":"Mediaelement.js malfunction in IE, no flashback works","body":"<p>I used the mediaelement.js in my site, i used for the example a .mp4 file with H.264 codec, works well in all browsers, but not works in any version of Internet explorer when i publish the site, on my localhost don't have any problem (the flash fallback works well) , but in my server don't works.</p>\n\n<p>The code the i used is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;VIDEO HTML5&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"player_files/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"player_files/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"player_files/mediaelementplayer.min.css\" rel=\"Stylesheet\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n\n&lt;video id=\"video1\" src=\"http://www.teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"http://www.teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n\n&lt;video width=\"640\" height=\"360\" id=\"video2\" poster=\"videos/precious.jpg\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\"&gt;\n    &lt;source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" /&gt;\n    &lt;source type=\"video/webm\" src=\"http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.webm\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;object width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"player_files/flashmediaelement.swf\"&gt;        \n        &lt;param name=\"movie\" value=\"player_files/flashmediaelement.swf\" /&gt; \n        &lt;param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"controls=true&amp;file=http://teletica.com/html5/videos/precious.mp4\" /&gt;         \n\n        &lt;img src=\"player_files/precious.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" alt=\"Here we are\" title=\"No video playback capabilities\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;   \n&lt;/video&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>The player works in this direction \"http://www.teletica.com/html5\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","scripting","batch","png","export"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12961381,"title":"Batch Export PNG Sequence from Adobe Flash FLA files","body":"<p>I found this script online to batch publish fla files, is it possible to change it to export png file sequences to the same directory?

In short, you've got to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTML 5 vs. HTML 4</li>\n<li>Large screens vs. small screens</li>\n<li>Touch-based input vs. mouse-based input</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, it's theoretically possible to build a single application that utilizes the latest in responsive design (to handle large AND small screens), utilizes the latest HTML 5 capabilities but degrades gracefully (to support the millions of users who are stuck on IE 6, 7, and 8), and somehow supports both touch input (huge hit areas, no hover/rollover behaviors, pinch-to-zoom, etc.) <strong>and</strong> mouse-based input.</p>\n\n<p>However, in my opinion, this requires a <strong>TON</strong> of additional code and is <strong>nightmarishly</strong> difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative - what I <em>generally</em> tend to recommend - is a Flash version for desktop users, and a <strong>HTML5/Touch</strong>-<em>only</em> version for mobile/iPad users.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>huge</strong> downside of this is that you've got two totally distinct sets of code. The upside is that you can create the optimal experience for both sets of users (i.e., you don't need to write code to support sub-optimal experiences for poor IE6/7/8 desktop users who are otherwise stuck with HTML4), and you can safely assume that mobile users are using a VERY current, VERY capable HTML5 compliant browser.</p>\n\n<p>Is my thinking correct?

You can even load in different flash movie clips through XML for the different animations. One of the features also allows you to flip an animation when you perform a certain action.

My current experience with Box2D is limited to creating a world, bodies and adding those bodies to the world in a functional manner.</p>\n\n<p>I'm finding it easy enough to integrate Box2D into my game environment, maintaining well-written code and have completed a few tutorials that walk through dealing with collisions. The issue that I'm facing now is that my game will have many bodies, each interacting with other bodies in different ways, and I'm finding it hard to write my own <code>b2ContactListener</code> subclass without it getting extremely messy.</p>\n\n<p>Based off a tutorial I used, I have created my own subclass of <code>b2ContactListener</code> and added an override of the <code>BeginContact()</code> method. The argument that <code>BeginContact()</code> receives when it is called will reference an instance of <code>b2Contact</code>, through which I can access two <code>b2Fixture</code> instances (the two instances that have collided). I am then able to access the <code>b2Body</code> instance associated with each of those <code>b2Fixture</code>s.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Currently I have a roundabout way of finding out what two things collided (i.e. whether they're a wall and a missile, or the player and a tree, etc) which uses <code>GetUserData()</code> and looks like this as an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var f1Player:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureA().GetBody().GetUserData() is Player\nvar f2Player:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureB().GetBody().GetUserData() is Player\nvar f1Tree:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureA().GetBody().GetUserData() is Tree\nvar f2Tree:Boolean = contact.GetFixtureB().GetBody().GetUserData() is Tree\n// ... continutes with all possible combinations.\n\n\n// Example of managing a collision:\nif(f1Player &amp;&amp; f2Tree)\n{\n    // Player (FixtureA) and Tree (FixtureB)\n}\n\nif(f2Player &amp;&amp; f1Tree)\n{\n    // Player (FixtureB) and Tree (FixtureA)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, this is going to end up extremely long and unmanageable. I also have to write each set of actions to perform twice to cater for a certain element being FixtureA or FixtureB, or vice versa (obviously in the form of a function call with the parameters swapped around rather than literally re-written).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is clearly not the correct approach, but I haven't been able to locate resources that more thoroughly explain collision detection management.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have experience with collision detection management using Box2D that they can share?

Then, tcpflow shows that all buffered data is sent to the client, but the client don't receives data. some seconds after that, connection dissapears from netstat and tcpflow shows that the same data is sent again, but this time the client receives the data so starts sending data to the server and the server receives it.

The \"other\" color can of course be almost the same one e.g. visually indistinguishable from black.</p>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","actionscript-3","flash","background"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":12795649,"title":"Actionscript workers limitation","body":"<p>I have few questions about workers. \nHow can i send to an worker complex objects of my own data types...serialization doesn't work and it is very sad :(\nWhen Adobe is planing to release workers that are able to exchange any data types, starting from primitive and to very complex objects?</p>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","actionscript-3","flash","sound-api","worker"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":259,"score":2,"question_id":11902863,"title":"Can ActionScript Workers be used to play / generate Sounds in a separate thread?","body":"<p>I'm very new to <strong>ActionScript Workers</strong>, but I would like to know if this is possible.</p>\n\n<p>From what I have read, <strong>ActionScript Workers</strong> (ASW) are like separate threads that can do more CPU intensive calculations without interrupting the Main thread (which is executing your main SWF file).</p>\n\n<p>The only example I really seen kicking around was the one illustrating animation playing at a consistent rate while an ASW took care of loading or calculating some intensive math formulas.</p>\n\n<p>Is the Sound API available for ActionScriptWorkers?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","filereference"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":12794244,"title":"Flex FileReference.upload does not trigger any events on subsequent calls","body":"<p>I'm using the PLUpload library for browser file uploads.\nIt's Flash module uses FileReference.</p>\n\n<p>When testing the uploads I kill the web server to see how it handles it and can be programmatically recovered from.

This approach translates\n  into a challenging problem – a P2P data exchange protocol that\n  can operate in churn rates where more than 90% of peers can\n  leave the overlay in under 10 seconds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there a public implementation of the code (or anything like it) available? I looked around and couldn't find anything, but it may be using a different name.</p></li>\n<li><p>The authors of the paper used a Java applet on the client. Now that Flash (sort of) has UDP support, would it be possible to do this part in Flash? Are there any known Flash implementations of distributed P2P web servers?</p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","flash-cs5"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":424,"score":0,"question_id":7599542,"title":"Flash CS5 won't execute AS3 code","body":"<p>I am getting a strange issue in Flash CS5.

The video did not play.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, for both devices, when pressing 'Load DRM Metadata' in the TVP, I received an 'Error #1009'.</p>\n\n<p>The SVP reported the Flash version as 10.2.164.128 for the NSZ-GT1, and 10.2.164.113 for the NSZ-GS7.</p>\n\n<p>For the second test, I used a locally built &amp; locally hosted OSMF sample player, version 1.5, configured with the example video from the Flash Access test site.</p>\n\n<p>As a reference I first tried a desktop PC browser flash plugin, and in this case I was presented with a prompt for the username and password; after entering these, the video played successfully.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I attempted this from the Chrome browser on both devices, although the OSMF player loaded I was never presented with the prompt for the username and password.</p>\n\n<p>Since there is no debug Flash player for Google TV, I was unable to investigate further with the device.</p>\n\n<p>Any clarification or insight into support for Flash Access on Google TV would be appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","css","image","actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":94,"score":1,"question_id":12735041,"title":"AS3: How to scale down multiple external html images in TextArea object's htmlText?","body":"<p>I'm new to AS3, and last touched Flash when it was with Macromedia, version 4.</p>\n\n<p>I'm building a flashapp to display images via html data.\nThe data is populated in a <code>TextArea</code> object via <code>htmlText</code> property.\nThe <code>TextArea</code> container has a fixed width and height;</p>\n\n<p>In the html data, I have multiple <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags referencing external images.\nHowever, the problem arise when the image referenced is larger than the <code>TextArea</code> dimensions.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import fl.controls.TextArea;\n\nvar box:*;\n\nbox = TextArea();\nbox.htmlText = \"External HTML Data with multiple &lt;img src='elsewhere.jpg'&gt; tags\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The images within the external data does not have any <code>id</code> attributes in it. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried css styling with the styleSheet property, but flash only supports a subset of CSS1 specs.\n<a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/StyleSheet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/StyleSheet.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So css <code>max-width</code> is nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>The closest possible solution I've read about, uses <code>getImageReference</code> method\n<a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/TextField.html#getImageReference%28%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/TextField.html#getImageReference()</a>\nfrom TextField object.</p>\n\n<p>This method requires the image in the image to be first loaded, then be called by <code>getImageReference</code> via <code>id</code> attribute to get a <code>DisplayObject</code> which then can be manipulated.</p>\n\n<p>From here, it seems that I would need to get a <code>string.match</code> method on the external data to match and insert different <code>id</code> attribute for each <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.

I am deep into development.</p>\n\n<p>This morning one of my testers reported seeing a flex based popup that I did not create.</p>\n\n<p>I am not able to post pictures here but to describe the popup - It has a grey header-bar with a small close button which looks more like a flex panel. As far as I'm aware this is not part of the standard flex popup. It then has a question mark image in the top left corner of the main window. I believe this is the stand in graphic that flex uses when it tried to load an image but can't. At the bottom of the popup is a text input box which is pre-filled with an IP address. The address is the same for both myself and the tester. Finally at the very bottom is an OK and a Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The buttons are styled because I set a global button skin for my app. Other than that I did not create this popup and cannot find any evidence of it in my scripts.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately fired up the same build that I have on my own iPad. I had tested it before sending out and had not seen any evidence of this before but when I tested it this morning, I too saw this popup. It seems to have literally occurred overnight.</p>\n\n<p>I did some more testing and have discovered that if I turn off all internet connections then the app won't even start. It hangs at the splash screen. I can't be certain about this build but I know that previous builds have most definitely worked offline.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched all through my scripts for something that might cause this. I am not using any reference libraries beyond the standard ones and I'm not using any ANE's. I have also checked other Flex apps that I am working on but they all seem fine.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else come across this before?

I will have x number of tickers that count up to a value that increment (every time when my timer fires, for example every 100ms), for example the value can be \"1.03\", and next time the timer fire it can be something like \"1.14\". I split this number into three \"columns\"=tickers and each ticker will have it value;\nticker1: 1\nticker2: 1\nticker3: 4</p>\n\n<p>When ticker3 get next \"0\"-value = 10, ticker2 should update to \"2\" and so on.\nThe problem is to make the numbers scroll so if the number was \"4\" the first time, and next time it is \"2\", it should actually scroll through all the numbers between that and so on, and not jump back up with that row.</p>\n\n<p>So if i for example stop the tickers at value \"1.14\", that should be the value the tickers stop at.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: CODE</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>package gui {\nimport flash.events.Event;\nimport com.greensock.TweenMax;\nimport com.greensock.easing.Linear;\nimport com.greensock.TweenLite;\n\nimport flash.display.MovieClip;\nimport flash.display.Sprite;\n\npublic class Ticker extends Sprite {\n\n    public var windowBg_mc:MovieClip;\n\n    private var _stepValue:int = 0;\n\n    public var row1:MovieClip;\n    public var row2:MovieClip;\n    private var _activeRow:MovieClip;\n\n    public var stopBtn:MovieClip;\n\n    public function Ticker() {\n        init(0);\n    }\n\n    private function init(val:int):void{\n\n        this.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, updateConnection);\n\n        _stepValue = val;\n\n        TweenMax.to(row2, 0, {tint: 0xff0000});\n\n        _activeRow = row1;\n\n        var yMoveTarget_num:Number = -(Number(_stepValue) * 34);\n\n        TweenLite.to(_activeRow, 5, {y: yMoveTarget_num, ease: Linear.easeNone});\n\n        updateConnection(null);\n    }\n\n    private function updateConnection(e:Event):void{\n\n        if(_activeRow.y &lt;= -342){\n            _activeRow.y = 340;\n            if( _activeRow == row1 ){\n                _activeRow = row2;\n            }else{\n                _activeRow = row1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if( _activeRow == row1 ){\n            row2.y = row1.y + 340;\n        }else{\n            row1.y = row2.y + 340;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public function tick(inpValue:int):void{\n\n        if(_stepValue == inpValue) return;\n\n        var oldValue : int = _stepValue;\n        _stepValue = inpValue;\n\n        if( _stepValue &lt; oldValue ){\n            //target must be change here\n        }\n\n        var yMoveTarget_num:Number = -(Number(_stepValue) * 34);\n        TweenLite.to(_activeRow, .4, {y: yMoveTarget_num, ease: Linear.easeIn});\n    }\n\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And \"tick\" is the method that gets called every 100ms.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","html5","video","html5-video","mediaelement.js"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":438,"score":0,"question_id":5130017,"title":"How do I stop my mediaelement.js player from downloading when it is paused/stopped?","body":"<p><strong>I have a video player on my site that once paused I would like to prevent rest of the video being downloaded.</strong> I am using <a href=\"http://mediaelementjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MediaElement.js</a> for html5 video with flash fallback.

This means:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Setting the best quality given the available bandwidth when the chat starts</li>\n<li>Responding to network congestions during chat by decreasing the quality.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The task is similar to <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/dynstream_advanced_pt1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dynamic stream switching</a>, but P2P has its specifics that make dynamic streaming approaches not work. For example, the maxBytesPerSecond metric monitored in dynamic stream switching is pretty useless in P2P where the receiving NetStream's buffer size is set to 0 to minimize latency.</p>\n\n<p>So far, it looks like the most reliable QoS metric for P2P is SRTT. In my simulated tests on a local network, a bandwidth congestion makes it shot up to 500 ms and more when there's a bandwidth limit introduced. However, it gives no hint as to how best adjust the value for <code>bandwidth</code> in <code>Camera.setQuality(0, bandwidth)</code> to respond to the congestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've done lots of experiments, and I still don't see a clear and simple solution to the problem. I'm also wondering how this issue is addressed (if at all) in other RTMFP chat solutions.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","flash","air","adobe","multiscreen"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":99,"score":2,"question_id":12672423,"title":"How to Multi-Screen android tablet application on Adobe AIR and Flash Professional","body":"<p>I have done app in ipad with Adobe AIR thats work fine in ipad,</p>\n\n<p>but now i have to create android tablet app for multiscreen resolution like this,</p>\n\n<p>2560*1600, 1366*768, 1280*800, 1280*768, 1024*768, 1024*600, 960*640, 960*540, 854*480, 800*600, 800*480, 800*400</p>\n\n<p>and my current .fla file resolution is 1024*768 so how can i create android tablet app with multi-screen?</p>\n\n<p>thanks </p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","flash","flex","video","inline"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12674837,"title":"Inline Video Player in Facebook Bug","body":"<p>I have created a player its in early stages though, but I need to play the videos inside Facebook timeline like youtube does.

This works fine for URLs with no special characters (by either setting the <code>source</code> property or calling <code>load()</code> on <code>Image</code>). However, when a URL is submitted that has special characters which have already been escaped, i.e. in most cases simply copied directly from the URL bar in a browser, <code>URLRequest</code> escapes the percent signs again with '%25', which makes the URL invalid and the server returns an error. Pasting the same URL in a browser loads the image just fine though. I've tried <code>decodeURI()</code> on the URL, but that ignores a large set of characters, so I tried <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>, and that decodes everything correctly, but when <code>URLRequest</code> goes to re-encode it, it ignores the now-decoded special characters and doesn't escape them, so in this case the URL is not valid, because it still has unsafe characters in it and fails. So, how can I send <code>URLRequest</code> something with special characters in it (encoded or unencoded) and have it actually work? Really, I wish it didn't do anything with my URL and let me determine if it's valid or not, but it's embedded in the Flash Player globals swc and is therefore the closed-source piece of flash and I can't see the source code.

The canvas refresh lag is noticeable around 5 symbols deep, and can become atrocious beyond that.

I'm just not sure what to be looking for as the source of Error 1009?  I've confirmed and reconfirmed my instance names...  all buttons exist in the same frame where the action script is located (frame 133).  i'm not importing any external objects...</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be much appreciated!</p>\n"}]}

Two, how can I make it collide properly with the boundaries so it reverses course at a proper rate?  And three, slightly unrelated but still a major challenge so I'll mention it now:  if my collision areas (scoring targets) are aligned vertically, can I put conditions in the collision detection to test for rate of speed to effectively collide with a target?  How can I determine that rate of speed?</p>\n\n<p>Ok, here's my current wobbly code for rolling my ball and hitting a target:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function moveBall(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    if (this.mouseX &lt;= 172 + gameTable.tableLane.width)\n    {\n        ball.x = this.mouseX;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ball.x = 172 + gameTable.tableLane.width;\n    }\n    if (this.mouseX &lt; 200)\n    {\n        ball.x = 200;\n    }\n    //trace(this.mouseX)\n}\n\nfunction releaseBall(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    //rollBall();\n    ballSpeed = rollPower * 10;\n    //set minimum roll distance\n    if (ballSpeed &lt; 313)\n    {\n        ballSpeed = 313;\n    }\n    ballStop = ball.y - ballSpeed;\n    gameElements.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, rollBall);\n    gameElements.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, ballTargetScore);\n    gameElements.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, moveBall);\n}\n\n\n\nfunction rollBall(event:Event):void\n{\n    trace(\"ballSpeed is \" + ballSpeed);\n    trace(\"ballStop is \" + ballStop);\n    if (ball.y &gt; ballStop)\n    {\n        ball.y -= 6;\n        ball.y += friction;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\n//match targets to scoring values which should be tied to determineScore()\nfunction ballTargetScore(event:Event):void\n{\n    var targetValue:String;\n    var targetArray:Array = new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaCTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLtTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRtTarget,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetTop,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetMiddle,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetLower,\n      gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerScoringAreaTarget);\n    var targetTextArray:Array =  new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaC_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLt_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRt_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaU_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaM_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaL_text.text,\n        gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerSA_text.text);\n\n    for (var i:uint; i &lt; targetArray.length; i++)\n    {\n        if (targetArray[i] != null)\n        {\n            trace(\"targetArray value is \" + targetArray[i]);\n            if (ball.hitTestObject(targetArray[i]))\n            {\n                targetValue = targetTextArray[i];\n                trace('targetValue becomes',targetValue);\n                determineScore(targetValue);\n                gameElements.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, rollBall);\n                gameElements.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, ballTargetScore);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more background on my development, please take a look at my previous question thread:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12560357/as3-how-can-i-get-rid-of-non-null-hittestobject-error-with-already-instantiated/12562887\">AS3: How can I get rid of non-null hitTestObject error with already instantiated objects?</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help,</p>\n\n<p>Alan</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Just want to add my function for determining the speed of the ball roll.  It doesn't use a keyboard or any other conventional, that I have found in searching, method to control movement.  The number changes dynamically until the mouse button is pressed and then that is the value to work with.  This is inside my drawGame function to create the game table.</p>\n\n<pre><code>gameElements.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, powerMeter);\n\nfunction powerMeter(event:Event):void\n{\n    rollPower +=  speed;\n    gameTable.powerMeter.height = rollPower;\n    //trace(rollPower);\n\n    if (rollPower == 60 || rollPower == 0)\n    {\n        speed *=  -1;\n        //trace(\"switch speed to \" + speed);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the list of my related global vars:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//physics vars\nvar rollPower:Number = 0;\nvar speed:Number = 1;//speed of ball on roll\nvar ballSpeed:Number;\nvar ballStop:Number;\nvar friction:Number = 0.15;\nvar gravity:Number = 0.70;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ok, I've sorta fixed it, but it is still messy visually.  The ball will now move backwards.  I've meant to put in a condition where the ball will be removed when it reaches a threshold which represents the gutter on the table; however, flash doesn't seem to run the condition statement soon enough to catch the ball before it has moved visually beyond the y value.  It does remove the ball, but it looks ugly as the ball has rolled back onto the lane before it disappears.  How can I get condition checking times sped up?</p>\n\n<p>Here's my modified code.  Pointers are appreciated. </p>\n\n<pre><code>function rollBall(event:Event):void\n{\n    trace(\"ballSpeed is \" + ballSpeed);\n    trace(\"ballStop is \" + ballStop);\n    if (ball.y &gt; ballStop)\n    {\n        ball.y -=  6;\n        ball.y +=  friction;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        gameElements.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, rollBall);\n        gameElements.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, rollBackwards);\n    }\n\n}//end rollBall\n\nfunction rollBackwards(event:Event):void\n{\n    trace(\"rollBackwards is in effect\");\n    trace(\"ball.y is \" + ball.y);\n    if (ball.y &lt; 313)\n    {\n        ball.y +=  6 + gravity;\n        if (ball.y &gt;= 313)\n        {\n            gameElements.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, ballTargetScore);\n            determineScore(null);\n        }\n    }\n}//end rollBackwards\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ok, I wanted to put an update in here.  I basically \"solved\" my rollBackwards timing issues by adjusting the Y coordinate.  I either measured wrong, or got my orientation in opposition to the direction I was meant to be moving.  It mostly works now.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function rollBackwards(event:Event):void\n{\n    //trace(\"rollBackwards is in effect\");\n    //trace(\"ball.y is \" + ball.y);\n    if (ball.y &lt; 240)\n    {\n        ball.y +=  6 + gravity;\n        if (ball.y &gt;= 235)\n        {\n            gameElements.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, ballTargetScore);\n            determineScore(null);\n        }\n    }\n}//end rollBackwards\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is still a little ugly looking is when/where the ball is removed after making collision with a target.  My, perhaps, awkward conditional chain of coordinate calculations largely works from an effectiveness POV, but the ball always seems to be removed several pixels(?) prior to the actual collision being measures - even accounting for bounding boxes as opposed to actual shapes.  I also attempted to turn the ball into a tween just before it was removed to make it fade away in a pretty manor, but that never seemed to work.  And I never even tried to tackle turning the arc-shaped \"bumpers\" under each target into actual collision objects that the ball could roll along if the aim was off.  That was just put into the \"too hard\" basket.  Below is my code for the collision measuring and the tweening, just in case anyone has any keen insights to add.  Otherwise, I'm relatively happy with the end result.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//called during determineScore event\nfunction disappearBall():void\n{\n    myBallTween = new Tween(ball,\"alpha\",Strong.easeOut,ball.y + 5,ball.y,8,false);\n    myBallTween.obj.alpha = 0;\n    myBallTween.start();\n}//end disappearBall\n\nfunction ballTargetScore(event:Event):void\n{\n    var targetValue:String;\n    var targetArray:Array = new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaCTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLtTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRtTarget,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetTop,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetMiddle,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetLower,\n      gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerScoringAreaTarget);\n    var targetTextArray:Array =  new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaC_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLt_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRt_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaU_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaM_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaL_text.text,\n        gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerSA_text.text);\n\n    for (var i:uint;

I think I will have issues with the bounding box of my objects on that one.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help,</p>\n\n<p>Alan</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's the response to Vesper with a cleaned up function (thanks) and new error.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>function ballTargetScore():void\n{\n    var targetValue:String;\n    var targetArray:Array = new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaCTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLtTarget,\n      gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRtTarget,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetTop,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetMiddle,\n      gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaTargetLower,\n      gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerScoringAreaTarget);\n    var targetTextArray:Array =  new Array(gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaC_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaLt_text.text,\n        gameTable.upperScoringArea.upperScoringAreaRt_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaU_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaM_text.text,\n        gameTable.middleScoringArea.middleScoringAreaL_text.text,\n        gameTable.lowerScoringArea.lowerSA_text.text);\n\n    for (var i:uint; i &lt; targetArray.length; i++)\n    {\n        if (targetArray[i] != null)\n        {\n            trace(\"targetArray value is \" + targetArray[i]);\n            if (ball.hitTestObject(targetArray[i]))\n            {\n                targetValue = targetTextArray[i];\n                trace('targetValue becomes',targetValue);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    determineScore(targetValue);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ballSpeed is 432</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object upperScoringAreaCTarget_mc] </p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object upperScoringAreaLtTarget_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object upperScoringAreaRtTarget_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object middleScoringAreaTargetTop_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object middleScoringAreaTargetMiddle_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object middleScoringAreaTargetLower_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>targetArray value is [object lowerScoringAreaTarget_mc]</p>\n  \n  <p>ArgumentError: Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>at flash.display::DisplayObjectContainer/removeChild() </p>\n    \n    <p>at SkeeBlast_7_fla::MainTimeline/determineScore() </p>\n    \n    <p>at SkeeBlast_7_fla::MainTimeline/ballTargetScore()</p>\n    \n    <p>at SkeeBlast_7_fla::MainTimeline/rollBall() </p>\n    \n    <p>at SkeeBlast_7_fla::MainTimeline/releaseBall()</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks for the assistance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The rules, which I'm sure are necessary, are making me turn this into a really long question.  :)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I sort of figured out the error about the DisplayObject, but the program still isn't working correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I fixed the error by adding my gameElements MC to my removeChild call in the determineScore function, which is below; however, the ball still isn't removed, even with the error gone, and the targetValue and the score never update (or show up in the trace from above).</p>\n\n<pre><code>function determineScore(scoreEvent:String):void\n{\n    if ( scoreEvent == \"D-O\" || scoreEvent == \"2XB\" || scoreEvent == \"?\")\n    {\n        if (scoreEvent == \"D-O\")\n        {\n            ballCount +=  1;\n            gameTable.tableDisplay.BR_text.text = ballCount - 1;\n            gameTable.tableDisplay.BR_text.embedFonts = false;\n            gameElements.removeChild(ball);\n            if (ballCount &gt; 0 )\n            {\n                initBall();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                drawEnd();\n            }\n        }\n        else if (scoreEvent == \"2XB\")\n        {\n            ballCount +=  2;\n            gameTable.tableDisplay.BR_text.text = ballCount - 1;\n            gameTable.tableDisplay.BR_text.embedFonts = false;\n            gameElements.removeChild(ball);\n            if (ballCount &gt; 0 )\n            {\n                initBall();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                drawEnd();\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            determineScore(allRandomScore(allScoresArray));\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        scoreTotal +=  Number(scoreEvent);\n        ballScore = Number(scoreEvent);\n        gameTable.tableDisplay.Score_text.text = scoreTotal;\n        gameTable.tableDisplay.Score_text.embedFonts = false;\n        gameElements.removeChild(ball);\n        if (ballCount &gt; 0 )\n        {\n            initBall();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            drawEnd();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks for looking at this.

When I drag the transformer div, I trap the drag event, figure out the delta_x and delta_y, and add these to the existing transform using the <code>jquery css()</code> function - so if I drag the transformer 10px to the right, I update the tx property of the transforms by +10 to move the wrapper and its swf content. </p>\n\n<p>Here's a simplified edit of the transform code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var dx = currentBounds.x - lastBounds.x; // delta x\nvar dy = currentBounds.y - lastBounds.y; // delta y\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; selectedItems.length; i++) {\n    var selectedItem = selectedItems[i];\n    var matrix = parseMatrix(selectedItem.css(\"transform\")); // utility to read a matrix into an object\n    matrix.tx += dx;\n    matrix.ty += dy;\n    var newMatrix = unparseMatrix(matrix); // reverse utility\n    selectedItem.css(\"transform\", newMatrix);\n    selectedItem.css(\"-moz-transform\", newMatrix);\n    selectedItem.css(\"-ms-transform\", newMatrix);\n    selectedItem.css(\"-webkit-transform\", newMatrix);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this works fine, apart from one oddity: whenever I drag the swf outside of its original bounds in Firefox, the stage stops being repainted, and the color sticks on whatever value it currently has. By tracing inside the swf I can see the function is still being called, and the shape is still being redrawn - it's just that in the browser, the whole object is not being repainted. (This is only in Firefox - IE and Chrome work fine) If, however, I modify my code so that instead of moving the wrapper with a transform, I simply update the  <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties, everything works as expected, and the stage keeps updating.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why this happens? My best guess is that <code>-moz-transform</code> takes some kind of a raster impression of an object, and then operates on that rather than the original, but I can't understand why that only happens when you move beyond the original object's boundaries? One more oddity is that if I right-click the transformed swf, the context menu appears as you would expect, but in Firefox it is in the original position of the swf, suggesting the transform has perhaps hidden the original and created a copy:</p>\n\n<p>Any light that anyone can shed would be most welcome. Although the workaround (using top / left instead of a transform) is quite straightforward, I'd like to stick with transforms if possible, as this will interact more cleanly with other parts of my application. Also I want to be able to apply more complex transforms: will Firefox (or other browsers) rasterize a swf that is rotated?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","media","live","red5","encoder"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12568073,"title":"Hide red5's context path (or Flash Media Live Encoder's FMS URL)","body":"<p>Is it possible to stream a webcam image via Flash Media Live Encoder to red5 (for example: rtmp://127.0.0.1/<strong>mySecretStreamInput</strong>) and make it available for clients on another URL (something like: rtmp://IP_ADDRESS/<strong>stream</strong>)?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":78,"score":0,"question_id":12565296,"title":"A flash based desktop game.

Without actually having looked at the SDKs, my understanding would have been that AIR enables you to develop Flash (i.e. ActionScript, and apparently also JavaScript/HTML) applications that can be run by the AIR runtime without the need of a browser (such as a pure desktop or smartphone application). The Flex SDK appears to be a collection of classes and additional APIs (similar to JavaFX?) to extend the \"standard\" Flash library.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I've downloaded the most recent versions of both SDKs, and apparently, it's not that simple. So, first I looked at the AIR SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html</a>, v3.4 as of now). As far as I can tell, the \"adt\" utility is the main part of AIR that lets you package finished applications. However, I'm not sure if the AIR SDK actually includes a compiler – say you have a bunch of ActionScript .as files and want to turn them into a .swf or .air file using the AIR SDK, is that even possible?</p>\n\n<p>The Flex SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html</a>, v4.6 as of now) unfortunately didn't help with the confusion. It does include compilers and other tools, but in its \"bin\" folder, I could also find \"adt\" and \"adl\" – the AIR tools! What's more, it also has \"AIR SDK license.pdf\" and \"AIR SDK readme.txt\" files; judging from those, it appears that the Flex SDK includes some older version of the AIR SDK version 2.</p>\n\n<p>To make things even more confusing, I also found a \"combined version of the Flex and AIR® SDKs (Flex SDK 4.6.0.23201 and AIR 3.4.0.2540 SDK)\" on Adobe's site (<a href=\"http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/</a>). It seems that this wasn't merely created by copying the AIR 3.4 files to the Flex 4.6 files, adding yet another item to the list.</p>\n\n<p>So, essentially, I'd like to know the differences between these two (three?) SDKs. Would I need the Flex utilities to compile? Why does the \"pure\" Flex SDK include parts (?) of AIR? Could I just copy any version of the AIR SDK into a Flex SDK to use both with e.g. FlashDevelop?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","flash","html5","javax.script"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":135,"score":0,"question_id":9991796,"title":"SwfUpload flash uploader not visible and not working in IOS ","body":"<p>i am working on a web application based on media gallery.In this application i am uploading media using SWFUpload either images and videos.When i try to open my application on IOS then uploader not visible there.Where it is working fine on safari installed on windows.I want some suggestions from experts of this field.\none site who is using SWFUpload is <a href=\"http://www.ehproductions.com/mediaimage.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ehproductions.com/mediaimage.htm</a>.\nHere SwfUploader working nice on windows but not on IOS machines.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any javax html5 compatible uploader? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","oauth-2.0","google-drive-sdk","google-drive"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":1,"question_id":12550894,"title":"Flash and Google Drive SDK cannot talk to each other","body":"<p>I need to create a flash web app connecting to Google Drive SDK to retrieve a public binary file but I am facing cross domain security issues.</p>\n\n<p>I am able to do it in javascript using <strong>cross-site xmlhttprequest</strong> with CORS.

Any help appreciated. cheers</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","actionscript-3","flash","internet-explorer"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":12440109,"title":"Flash urlrequest relative path in IE","body":"<p>I am making a small flash script for uploading files.

When the user clicks the main button, the control dispatches an itemClick (MenuEvent.ITEM_CLICK) event that contains information about the selected menu item. Therefore, the same itemClick event is dispatched when the user clicks the main button or selects the current item from the pop-up menu. Because the same event is dispatched in both cases, clicking on the main button produces the same behavior as clicking on the last selected menuItem, so the main button plays the role of a frequently used menu item.”</p>\n\n<p>In my application I got a requirement to change the existing functionality of the main button. It should not navigate to the frequently used menu item screen instead it should open the popup and it should behave exactly same as the secondary button ( v).</p>\n\n<p>I tried with  openAlways=true property of PopUpMenuButton control. But it did not solve the problem completely. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - </p>\n\n<p>I already tried the option mentioned by TRISH below. But it is not solving my problem.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever we click on the main button of PopUpMenuButton control two events will be dispatched. First click event will be dispatched followed by itemClick event. In the Click event handler we are writing code to open the popup so it is opening the popup and in the itemclick event handler respective page navigation code is there so it is navigating to that particular page. (These two are happening one by one so first popup is opening and within seconds it is navigating to the recently opened page because of itemclick handler code. So whenever we are clicking on main button these two actions are happening parallel hence we are getting a popup blink but not stable popup. If we modify anything in itemclick handler it is effecting the functionality of popup button because same handler for both the button clicks. Even the event target is also same in case of itemclick event irrespective of main button or popup button.)</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","bitmapdata"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":6,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15219,"score":5,"question_id":1098890,"title":"AS3:How to change a colored Bitmap's BitmapData to black and white?","body":"<p>How can I change the bitmapdata of a coloured Bitmap to <strong>Black and White</strong> in <strong>AS3</strong> ? \nI'm developing a simple image editor tool for a CMS in flash. </p>\n\n<p>People should be able to switch the colour of the uploaded Bitmap to black and white. <strong>I want the bitmapdata itself to change</strong> So I can write it to a ByteArray with Adobe's JPGEncoder Class afterwards. </p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":12422916,"title":"AS3 XML Loading - variable does not exist outside the loading function","body":"<pre><code>//Generating menu from XML\nvar linksXML:XML;\nvar linksLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\nvar linksDB:Array = new Array();\nlinksLoader.load(new URLRequest(\"menu_links.xml\"));\nlinksLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, processXML);\nfunction processXML(evnt:Event):void {\n    linksXML = new XML(evnt.target.data);\n    for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; linksXML.link.length(); i++){\n        var newLink:Array = [linksXML.link[i].@name, linksXML.link[i].@param, linksXML.link[i]];\n        linksDB[i] = new Array(newLink);\n        trace(linksDB);\n    }\n}\ntrace(linksXML.*);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output is</p>\n\n<pre><code>Second trace: \nnull\nFirst trace: \n&lt;menu&gt;\n  &lt;link name=\"first\" param=\"true\"&gt;first.php&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;link name=\"second\" param=\"true\"&gt;second.php&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;link name=\"third\" param=\"true\"&gt;third.php&lt;/link&gt;\n&lt;/menu&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So in my opinion flash is losing variable when exitin the function.

With some server-side logging as well as some logging hacked into the swf, I know that the UrlLoader is successfully doing and GET'ing a crossdomain.xml file, is correctly processing it (ie: if I wreck it, I get a security error), and is also successfully completing the \"load\" request (the server sends the data).

What seems to have been happening was that the Event.COMPLETE event handler (onComplete in the stack trace) was using the global SP object.  Something about the release (vs debug) compilation must have been affecting the startup timing of the SP variable initialization.

I'm adding functionality to my application so that if a user clicks one of the buttons around the transformed movieclip, a lightbox-style layer appears over the 3D-transformed movieclip.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm having is that when the lightbox layer appears, there's a perceptible shift in the location/transformation of the transformed movieclip, and when the lightbox layer is removed, the transformed movieclip returns to its original location.  Stranger still, this effect only happens about half the time; usually, the first couple of lightbox invocations have no effect, but the third or fourth causes the 3D movieclip to jump around.</p>\n\n<p>There's no 3D elements that are part of the lighbox (i.e. no z-indices are being explicitly set), and I can't find documentation of this phenomenon anywhere else.  Is this a bug in FP 10?  If it is, the only workaround I can think of is taking a snapshot of the 3D-transformed movieclip as <code>bitmapData</code> and showing that in place of the 3D mc whenever the lightbox appears, but that seems inefficient and brutally hackish.

Then the code adds objects from the next level...</p>\n\n<p>Catching and the removing event listeners is done by this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>override public function addEventListener(type:String, listener:Function, useCapture:Boolean=false, priority:int=0, useWeakReference:Boolean=false):void\n    {\n        super.addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture, priority, useWeakReference);\n        arrListeners.push({type:type, listener:listener});\n\n    }\n\n    private function clearEvents():void\n    {\n       for(var i:Number = 1; i&lt;arrListeners.length; i++){\n          if(this.hasEventListener(arrListeners[i].type))\n        {\n             this.removeEventListener(arrListeners[i].type, arrListeners[i].listener);\n          }\n       }\n       arrListeners = []\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code overrides internal addEventListeners and makes every Listener to be added in an array.

However, when an EventListener is assigned directly to an Object then it's not added to the array, so it doesn't get removed automatically later.</p>\n\n<p>I know that when you remove the object, also you remove the Event Listeners assigned to it.

I heard that Adobe tried to do something similar with the FalconJS compiler prototype (see this <a href=\"http://tv.adobe.com/watch/flex-community-summit-december-2011/open-discussion-about-falcon-and-falconjs/\">Adobe video Open Discussion about Falcon and FalconJS</a> for more information), but they stopped the effort. The code of the FalconJS proof-of-concept will be contributed to the Apache Foundation as part of the Apache Flex project, but </p>\n\n<p>It is surprising to see that there is not a single application utilizing both runtimes in the OpenLaszlo showcase section: <a href=\"http://www.openlaszlo.org/showcase\">http://www.openlaszlo.org/showcase</a></p>\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://ajaxian.com/archives/laszlo-webtop\">old Ajaxian article from 2007</a> I read that Laszlo Webtop's \"final release will support OpenLaszlo 4, which will mean support for both Ajax and Flash applications\". But the Laszlo Webtop demo site <a href=\"http://gowebtop.com/webtop/\">http://gowebtop.com/webtop/</a> has only a Flash based version of Webtop. I've read in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12089808/which-openlaszlo-version-should-i-use-for-new-projects-and-when-migrating-applic\">this Stackoverflow discussion</a> that <a href=\"http://www.gliffy.com\">Gliffy</a> - one of the most impressive OpenLaszlo applications I know - has been rebuilt using JavaScript, not utilizing the dual-runtime capability of OpenLaszlo.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any other large OpenLaszlo applications deployed as both HTML5/DHTML and Flash, which are maybe not listed on the OpenLaszlo.org website? Even if Flash is not that popular any more, it is still a relevant technology for a number of use cases (audio conferencing, 3d in the browser, GPU accelerated video playback, etc.).</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","actionscript-3","papervision3d"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11486,"score":2,"question_id":673059,"title":"AS3 DAE Augmented Reality PaperVision 3D","body":"<p>I have been playing with Augmented Reality recently (and having lots of fun with it too!!)

So my question today isn't dealing with any code, but how to go about this the correct way from the start. I have a video player built to a static size (max: 800x600) which I'll have to re-code every time I need it to be a different size.</p>\n\n<p>What I need it to do in the near future is dynamically resize itself and all the elements inside of it based on 1 width variable that it will received either from HTML or XML.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now to me there are 2 ways to go about this:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the smallest size possible and resize upwards, but I'm unsure of how the Flash movie will actually expand upwards as of right now.</li>\n<li>Or 2, start with the largest size possible (in this case 800x600) and size everything down.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Step 1, I think seems to be the better way to go about this (ala YouTube style), but Step 2 also seems like it could be the easier way? A friend of mine mentioned that I should go with the larger size and have elements resize in each class, then fix to the upper left hand corner. However for the player to fit inside of certain div columns on sites, blogs whatever he said that there will have to be an HTML/CSS side of this... meaning that the div containing the resized flash player will have to cover up the areas of the Flash movie that are not to be shown? Is that possible to put a 800x600 flash movie into a div that smaller then 800 pixels wide? And cover it up with another div?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anyways, my mission is to be able to have a dynamically sized player like this:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4090193306%5F852e7bebf4%5Fo.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?

Haxe?","body":"<p>I'm planning on making a little game. And I'm looking for an engine. Basically what I want is Unity, but then 2D. It's a very interface heavy game, stylized, so what I need is an engine (or similar) in which it's easy to draw lines, primitives and text (and bitmaps, though that's less important.) The game will have a game world, though you'll never directly see it. All you'll get is a bunch of information about it (text, lines, graphs, ...) </p>\n\n<p>I know you could use Unity to make 2D games, though for what I have in mind it's not optimal and the way objects work in Unity isn't really how I want to structure my game. (I've worked a lot in Unity and absolutely love it, though I don't think it's the right tool for this game.)</p>\n\n<p>What I love about Unity is that you can just build for any platform, with a single click, and it just works. It also already has it's own way of building your gameobjects, and since I'm making something very different, I don't want this. I need more control over the objects and actually only want the engine to draw stuff.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about using Flash, ActionScript3. It should be very good at drawing lines and text. And hopefully just as easy to build.</p>\n\n<p>I also checked out HTML5 and javascript, using KineticJS, which can draw lines and primites very easily (pretty much exactly like I want it), though I hate javascript and want more structured code. Maybe it's just me that I can't get javascript to be clean enough for my taste, but well, that's something we'll have to live with then :P</p>\n\n<p>My question now is, since I never used flash. What are your thoughts on this. Is it perfect for this kind of stylized text-based games? Is it easy to build (I'm using FlashDevelop since that's a free way to make flash stuff)? On top of that, can I use a single code base for Windows and Mac (maybe even iOS, Android or other, though that's less important)?</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe you have another suggestion I could check out? (I already checked out a bunch of other question here, though none were really helpful. So yea it's another 'I'm looking for an engine' question, so don't kill me for that. I already did quite a bit of looking around, though would love some more input from others.)</p>\n\n<p>Edit1: I've been looking around some more and found Haxe (http://haxe.org/) seems promising, can anyone recommend this or?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot,</p>\n\n<p>-Pablo</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":12275689,"title":"Flash and External Javascript","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/690730/calling-a-flash-externalinterface-with-javascript\">calling a Flash ExternalInterface with JavaScript</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a flash file with AS code.

The code SWF files must load or embed the creative assets and interact with the code therein for our apps to function.</p>\n\n<p>For iOS mobile development, there is another consideration - it is not possible to load runtime code in an AIR app packages for iOS because of Apple TOS (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8688645/is-it-possible-to-embed-or-load-swfs-when-making-iphone-apps-is-it-allowed-by-a\">related question</a>).  Hence, it is not possible to use a Loader to load SWFs in an iOS environment and retain their code.</p>\n\n<p>Embedding a SWF into an ActionScript file the standard way results in a Loader that loads the embedded SWF directly as bytes.  This results in access to the top-level, main timeline as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\")]\n  private var no_aot_support:Class;\n\npublic function main():void\n{\n  var no_ios:* = new no_aot_support();\n  addChild(no_ios);\n  no_ios.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, function():void {\n    var timeline:MovieClip = no_ios.getChildAt(0).getChildAt(0);\n    trace(timeline.foo); // foo variable exists, output is 'blah'\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this embedding mechanism doesn't work on iOS devices because runtime-code is not allowed per Apple's TOS - all code must be passed through the ahead-of-time compiler (AOTCompiler) at compile-time, and the SWF embedded in this way does not meet this criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Asking around, I <a href=\"http://hybridmindset.com/blog/Rendering-Embedded-SWFs-On-iOS-Devices-Using-AIR-2.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">found</a> that one can use a class-level embed to get around this, as a class-level embed does go through the compiler and will result in working code under iOS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\", symbol=\"Symbol1\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine, but I don't want to reference a symbol in the SWF, I want the whole swf (aka reference the main timeline), but the following results in a compiler error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also decompiled the SWF, found the main timeline symbol, and tried this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\", symbol=\"embed_test_fla.MainTimeline\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the compiler insists this symbol doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>Since I have many, many SWF assets, I need a solution that doesn't involve changing my whole workflow (i.e. going into each FLA and making changes).  This should be possible, and if not, this is a workflow problem Adobe should address.</p>\n\n<p>So here I am stuck - regular embeds get the MainTimeline but don't work in iOS, class-level embeds work in iOS and can't access the MainTimeline.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"http://onetacoshort.com/temp/embed_test.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">download my expample project</a> and play with this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flash-cs5","flash-cs4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":112,"score":1,"question_id":12236749,"title":"hit test only on the visible content of MOVIECLIP","body":"<p>I have masked a Bitmap using a shape and have converted this to a movie clip.\nNow only the masked image is inside the movieclip. i have added a mouse click event listener for this movie clip and still the click is taken for the whole movieclip. how do i manage to click only the visible area of the movieclip.</p>\n\n<p>`</p>\n\n<pre><code>//img is a bitmap on stage and s1 is an irregular shape on the stage which is a movieclip\nimg.mask = s1;\n\nvar bmp:Bitmap = new Bitmap(new BitmapData(img.width,img.height,true));\nbmp.bitmapData.draw(img);\nvar n:MovieClip = new MovieClip();\n\n\n\nn.addChild(bmp);\n\naddChild(n);\n\n\ntrace(s1.width + \" \" + s1.height);\ntrace(n.width + \" \" + n.height);\nn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, clicked);\nremoveChild(s1);\nremoveChild(img);\n\nfunction clicked(m:MouseEvent):void\n{\n            trace(n.hitTestPoint(n.mouseX,n.mouseY, false));\n            trace(\"clikckedek kkc kkeke\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>`</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","flex4"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":0,"question_id":12202581,"title":"Get available browser width and height","body":"<p>How do I get the available browser width and height in Flex (<strong><em>not</em></strong> Flash)? </p>\n\n<p>There is Capabilities.screenResolutionY and screenResolutionX that give the total monitor resolution and there is stage.stageWidth and stage.stageHeight but in the documentation it says \"Calling the stageWidth property of a Stage object throws an exception for any caller that is not in the same security sandbox as the Stage owner (the main SWF file)\".

I can easily imagine that some Actionscript inserted on a layer above the bone animation layer could actually force a symbol swap to occur, thus resolving the issue.  This code may in fact be fairly simple, but would require the user to enter certain information into certain sections of the code (the name of the symbol which would replace the existing symbol, and on which frame or frames of the animation the user wanted the swap to occur).  Because most animators don't want to spend the time putting in the code, and then digging through it to enter the symbol names in the right places, I think our plug-in would make this all a lot easier.  The user would simply click on a \"Bone Tool Helper\" icon in the toolbar, and a window would pop up with empty fields which the user would populate with the required info.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine our Plug-In would look something like <a href=\"http://www.animonger.com/flashtools.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Plug-Ins offered here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those tools solve other issues that Flash has (not the Bone Tool issues).  They have free trial editions (with limited functionality), and there is a charge for the \"pro\" versions.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unfamiliar with programming this type of plug-in. How difficult would it be to build a production-ready, user-friendly plug-in as described?

I would appreciate any help that you all might be able to offer. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT!!!</p>\n\n<p>As suggested by Will, I attempted to create a timer based network monitoring subsystem. In the IO_ERROR handler on my RSS Ticker, I stop the RSS timer, and start the Network Monitoring Timer. Every 10 seconds, it attempts to download a file from the server. It continues doing so until it works, at which point it turns its own timer off, the restarts the RSS timer.</p>\n\n<p>Should work in theory. Not only that, but it does work if I change it to downloading a website instead of a network file. When using the network file, once it fails, it keeps failing, even after the connection is reestablished. Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>...\n\nfunction ioRSSFeedXMLLoaderErrorHandler(e:Event):void\n{\n    rssTickerTMR.stop();\n    networkMonitorTMR.start();\n\n    trace(\"ioRSSFeedXMLLoaderErrorHandler:\");\n    trace(e.toString());\n\n    ins_rssTitle.text = \"Waiting for connection...\";\n    ins_rssContent.text = \"\";\n\n\n}\n\n// netowrk monitor\nvar networkMonitorXMLLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\nnetworkMonitorXMLLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, networkMonitorXMLLLoaded); \nnetworkMonitorXMLLoader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, networkMonitorXMLLoaderErrorHandler);\n\nvar networkMonitorTMR:Timer = new Timer(10000,0);\nnetworkMonitorTMR.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, checkNetwork);\n\n\nfunction checkNetwork(e:Event = null):void\n{\n    networkMonitorXMLLoader.load(new URLRequest(\"//server/share/file.xml\")); \n}\n\nfunction networkMonitorXMLLoaderErrorHandler(e:Event = null) :void\n{\n    trace(\"Still Off\");\n}\n\nfunction networkMonitorXMLLLoaded(e:Event = null) :void\n{\n    trace(\"Back On\");\n    rssTickerTMR.start();\n    networkMonitorTMR.stop();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I said, if i switch \"//server/shar/file.xml\" to <a href=\"http://www.google.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.ca</a>, it works. When i unplug my ethernet, the network monitor starts, when I plug it back it, it switches back to the RSS... but with my network resource, it just continues to fail...</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","keyframe","after-effects"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":129,"score":1,"question_id":10955621,"title":"Is there a way to export keyframe data from After Effects to flash","body":"<p>I used a motion tracker in After effects to trace the path of an object.

Well, we pretty quickly hit some sort of limit with the performance where, even with a modest number of such connections, latency becomes a very serious issue.</p>\n\n<p>The server's computer's CPU and memory usage isn't going off the deep end, and the FMS server's CPU and memory usage isn't going off the deep end.  They don't even seem to be affected that much by this.  However in the admin console for the FMS server, it quickly becomes evident it's a bandwidth problem of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>What's strange though is that for a little while, if I keep just adding new connections, the bandwidth usage goes up fairly linearly.  Then it peaks.  Once it gets to about 20-25 Mbps, it won't go any further.</p>\n\n<p>I've looked around for a way to configure this limit to be a lot higher than it currently is.  I haven't been able to find anything.  The closest I've come is with the BandwidthCap tags in Application.xml, but those don't really apply; they're just capping the bandwidth for individual connections.</p>\n\n<p>Is there not some way for me to raise the bandwidth limit for the overall server so that we could have a halfway decent number of simultaneous video streaming connections?  We are running the FMS server on a computer that meets only about half of the minimum memory requirements, and I am aware that this may be the only real problem here.  However I need to know whether this is true before I tell my boss that we need more memory.  If there is a chance this is just configurable or something, I need to try that first.

I can also see them when I use the IE developer tools to check the response headers in the network feed for the page.</p>\n\n<p>So I got those set, but I am still having the problem.

To accomplish that, I using a method similar to the one listed on <a href=\"http://www.codelixir.com/zero-clipboard-multi-instance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, where the ZeroClipboard.Client() element for each row is created when the user mouses over the row.  This is working great in FireFox, but not in Chrome.  </p>\n\n<p>Also as a note: I copied the contents of the ZeroClipboard.js file into the user script itself instead of including it in an external file.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the markup that creates the copy button for each element<br>\n    <code>&lt;span style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline; cursor:pointer\" id=\"copy_'+id+'\" class=\"CopyLink\" link=\"'+url+'\" onmouseover=\"clipboard.add(this)\"&gt;Copy&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Here is the code segment that adds the clipboard's client object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function main(){\n    window.clipboard = {\n        load: function (){\n            if(!clipboard.initialized){\n                ZeroClipboard.setMoviePath(\"http://www.swfcabin.com/swf-files/1343927328.swf\");\n                clipboard.initialized=true;\n                console.log(\"Clipboard intialized\");\n            }\n        },\n        add: function(element){\n            clipboard.load();\n            var clip = new ZeroClipboard.Client();\n            console.log('Clipboard client loaded: ' + element.id);\n\n            clip.glue(element, element.parentNode);\n            console.log('Clipboard glued: ' + element.id);\n\n            clip.setText(element.getAttribute('link'));\n            console.log('Clipboard text set: ' + element.getAttribute('link'));\n\n            clip.addEventListener('complete',function(client,text) {\n                console.log('Clipboard copied: ' + text);//doesn't fire in chrome\n            });\n\n            clip.addEventListener('load',function(client) {\n                console.log('Clipboard loaded: ' + element.getAttribute('link'));\n            });\n        }        \n    }\n    //other code in user script including injecting above markup\n    //as well as contents of ZeroClipboard.js\n    window.ZeroClipboard = { ... }\n}\n\nvar script = document.createElement(\"script\");\nscript.appendChild(document.createTextNode('('+main+')()'));\n(document.head || document.body || document.documentElement).appendChild(script);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this block, every console.log fires in FireFox when I mouse over and click the copy span, but in chrome, all except the 'complete' listener fire.

I am also able to verify that the flash object is being added to the page in the correct location, but it is simply not responding to a click.  </p>\n\n<p>Since the zeroclipboard code is no longer being maintained according to the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/\" rel=\"nofollow\">site</a>, I'm hoping someone out there can help me out.  I'm thinking there is possibly some issue with dynamically adding the embedded flash objects in chrome on mouseover, or perhaps some difference between user scripts in chrome vs firefox with greasemonkey?
