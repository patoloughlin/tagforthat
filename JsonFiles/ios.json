This works propery in all desktop browsers i have checked as well as within android. The issue lies with clicking on the LIs in the footer. I have attempted to attach a click event to the footer elements via the following: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#footer li').live('click', function(e) { \n\n        Site.loadpage($(this).attr('page') + '.html');\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But nothing happens (no javascript errors or anything). So to get more information i added a more generic click event, where perhaps i would find some other element getting in the way that is capturing the event with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('*').live('click', function(e) { \n\n    alert(e.target);\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this event, i can click anywhere on my page and i get an alert with the type of element i have clicked on. <strong>EXCEPT for in the footer</strong>, where nothing at all happening. </p>\n\n<p>Here is some further information about the page i am using this with, i can provide more information if necessary, the only other thing that may be relevant is that i am using jquery for this (obviously).</p>\n\n<p>I have a page with the following structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"header\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div id=\"footer\"&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li page=\"projects\" class=\"projects\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li page=\"people\" class=\"people active\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;People&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    \n                &lt;li page=\"assignments\" class=\"assignments\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assignments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li page=\"search\" class=\"search\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li page=\"more\" class=\"more\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the following CSS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>html { \n\n    height:100%; \n    width: 100%;\n    margin:0; \n    overflow: hidden; \n    padding: 0px; \n    position: fixed;\n    text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px transparent !important;\n    letter-spacing: 0px;\n    font-family: Helvetica;\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nbody { \n\n    padding: 0px;\n    margin: 0px; \n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    font-family: Helvetica;\n}\n\n#header { \n\n    background: url(../images/devices/iphone/header.jpg); \n    color: white;\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0px;\n    left: 0px;\n    right: 0px;\n    height: 45px; /* ADJUST FOR IPAD */\n    box-shadow: -5px -5px 4px 7px #888;\n}\n\n#header .center { \n\n    position: static;\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n    max-height: 45px; /* ADJUST FOR IPAD */\n    text-align: center;\n\n}\n\n#header h1.center { margin: 8px 0px 10px 0px; }\n\n#content { \n\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 48px;\n    top: 45px;\n    left: 0px;\n    right: 0px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n\n\n\n}\n\n#footer { \n\n    background: url(../images/devices/iphone/header.jpg);\n    background-size: 48px 100%;\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 0px;\n    left: 0px;\n    right: 0px;\n    height: 48px; /* ADJUST FOR IPAD */\n    color: white;\n    text-align: center;\n    display: none;\n}\n\n#footer { text-align: center; }\n#footer ul { list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 1px; font-size: 8px; }\n#footer li { padding-top: 35px; padding-bottom: 1px; display: inline-block; background-image: url(../images/inactive-menu.png); width: 62px; background-size: 312px; }\n#footer li.active { background-image: url(../images/active-menu.png); }\n#footer li span { width: 57px; padding-top: 10px; }\n#footer li.projects { background-position: 0px 0px;}\n#footer li.people { background-position: -62px 0px;}\n#footer li.assignments { background-position: -124px 0px;}\n#footer li.search { background-position: -187px 0px;}\n#footer li.more { background-position: -250px 0px;}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ios","frameworks","unity3d"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":1,"question_id":13267141,"title":"How to use iOS framework with Unity?","body":"<p>I'm trying to use an iOS native framework inside Unity, but I don't know how.</p>\n\n<p>Inside my C# script, I call a native function like this : </p>\n\n<pre><code>[DllImport (\"__Internal\")]\n    private static extern void writeHello();\n\n    void Start () {\n        writeHello();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have drag the iOS framework inside my project like this : </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/583990ScreenShot20121107at102612AM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to my image</a></p>\n\n<p>But when I deploy my app on iPad, xCode showing this error : </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:   \"_writeHello\", referenced\n  from:\n        RegisterMonoModules() in RegisterMonoModules.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7 clang: error: linker command failed with\n  exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't understand why, and I don't know if what I'm trying to do is possible.\nHelp!

Just recently my iOS app began to fail with the dreaded <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> error. I did a lot of research on SO and Google and received some great advice, but none of the posts have helped me to resolve my issue. By now, I understand that EXC_BAD_ACCESS could be one of two things:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1) A pointer is now pointing to memory that was deallocated.\n2) A pointer itself is corrupt.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I read and followed the instructions <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3111585/tracking-down-exc-bad-access-without-nszombie\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://loufranco.com/blog/files/Understanding-EXC_BAD_ACCESS.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327082/exc-bad-access-signal-received\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://mobiledevelopertips.com/debugging/tracking-down-exc_bad_access-errors-with-nszombieenabled.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. When I perform \"Build and Run\" I can reproduce the exc_bad_access 100% of the time.  However, when I enabled NSZombie in either the debugger or in Instruments, I <strong>never</strong> can reproduce the issue. Furthermore, NSZombie does not leave any helpful information in the console.</p>\n\n<p>The closest I got to pinpointing the issue was by literally putting an NSLog after every single line of code, in order to see where it was crashing.  I believe that it is crashing at two distinct points - both of which are returning a cell in the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code>. Below I'm providing the two methods where I believe things are crashing, as well as the error output on my console. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>\n\n<p>The offending method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath

When the account is created, the user can also choose a password and later sign in without using Facebook, just with email and password.  By the way, there are also users whose accounts are not Facebook connected and who only can log in with email and password.

However, if they are a Facebook-connected user who did not log in via Facebook, how can we open the dialog on their behalf?  Is it kosher for the app to retrieve the Facebook access token we have stored for the user on our backend?  If not, what other recourse is there?  We can open another Facebook session then, but the user could log in as a completely different user than the one to which their MyApp account is connected, which (while not necessarily that bad) is not the desired behavior. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help!

This would probably work\nfine but I'm bothered about situations where the player exits the\napp or worse the app crashes, meaning that the PFObjects that now\ncontain new data are not updated on the server and are lost, so when\nthe player loads the game back up, they will see an older state of\nthe game.</p></li>\n<li><p>Always keep an offline version of the PFObjects. When the game\n    loads, it checks the offline version to see if the online version of\n    the data is newer or older if it's older then it uploads the new\n    (offline) data to parse, and then continues with that. I don't\n    really see any problem with that other than I don't know how to do\n    it! :p</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding point 1. Parse have told me the following...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The app will be terminated before the save operation finishes, by\n  default. You can request a background execution task that should give\n  you enough time to finish saving objects in the background. You can\n  see an example of this in Anypic's source code:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic/blob/master/Anypic-iOS/Anypic/PAPEditPhotoViewController.m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic/blob/master/Anypic-iOS/Anypic/PAPEditPhotoViewController.m</a></p>\n  \n  <p>self.photoPostBackgroundTaskId = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]\n  beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:^{\n          [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTask:self.photoPostBackgroundTaskId];\n      }];</p>\n  \n  <p>You'll want to look up beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler: in\n  the iOS docs for more info.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that's definitely an avenue I could explore although it looks a fairly complex one, and I'm a little bothered by the use of \"should give you enough time\" to save the objects, meaning maybe there will be situations when it's not.</p>\n\n<p>So (finally) on to my questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Of those 2 solutions offered above, in the view of the experts on here, which is going to be the most straightforward (i'e easy for a beginner) solution for me to have a go at?</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding point 2. There seems to be a myriad of ways to save infomation offline in ios, I've read about NSUserDefaults, SQLLite, plists, core data and so on. All I'll be looking to do is save a few arrays of PFObjects offline, that's all, no files, no graphics etc. Although there will be a lot of PFObjects to save probably around a 1000. As with point 1, which will be the most straightforward way to save this data offline? What would be great would be to have a few lines of code that saves it all out locally, and I can use a few lines to read it all back in and re-populate the PFObjects if needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again regarding point 2. How could that the offline date is more up to date? simply save the current time with NSDate?</p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","parsing","uilabel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13296278,"title":"Paste NSString from parse into UILabel","body":"<p>I'd like to grab the NSString which I created on parse.com and paste it into a label, if the view loads.

The AVPlayer successfully uses Airplay to play the commercial (not sure why, but that's good I guess).  However, after the commercial the MPMoviePlayerController wants to start at zero again (on some devices and not others) so the timing get's all messed up.

I'm trying to understand what I did incorrectly.</p>\n\n<h2>In detail</h2>\n\n<p>I have an Xcode C++ project for iOS that needs to be integrated with Amazon's AWS SDK. I downloaded the latest version of the SDK. The SDK is distributed as a framework. According to Amazon's article <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/mobile/sdkforios/gsg/Welcome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Getting Started with the AWS SDK for iOS\">Getting Started with the AWS SDK for iOS</a>, all I had to do was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Control-click Frameworks Group, then click Add files to &lt; project name ></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From other Internet resources and my personal knowledge I knew that adding the framework to the project's \"Build Binary With Libraries\" build phase should work too.</p>\n\n<p>None of the two methods worked. The compiler couldn't find the header files and the linker couldn't find the binary. Moreover, when the framework appeared in the project navigator, expanding the node showed nothing, while other frameworks usually contain their resources and include files.</p>\n\n<p>Sniffing around I noticed that the directory structure of the framework is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AWSiOSSDK.framework/\n   Versions/\n      A/\n         Headers/\n         Resources/ \n         AWSiOSSDK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is, as far as I understand, not exactly as <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Apple requires\">Apple requires</a> it to be. So, in a desperate attempt I removed the <code>Versions/A</code> part; i.e., put all the content of the framework immediately under <code>AWSiOSSDK.framework</code> directory.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly that solved all the problems - the headers are found, the binaries are linked, everything works. Now I wonder why. I assume a framework distributed by such a respected company as Amazon should have a correct form. Then why didn't it work? Why my modified structure works? Are there frameworks with different structures? How do I tell the compiler and the linker to accept the original form? Or does Amazon distribute a broken bundle?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","cocoa-touch","fonts"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1583,"score":0,"question_id":8090916,"title":"Fonts on iOS device","body":"<p>I've read the available font families by <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIFont_Class/Reference/Reference.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>[UIFont familyNames]</code></a>, but I've got various lists on different devices (but with the same iOS version).

My colleagues are getting confused, because when they want to see which VC connects to another, they have to look into the code...</p>\n\n<p>Therefore my question... Is there any way to connect ViewControllers in InterfaceBuilder(storyboard) without creating any particular kind of segue(Modal, push, custom). Just to demonstrate connections between view controllers?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","cocoa-touch","cocoa"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":1,"question_id":13291198,"title":"Declaring delegates on .m","body":"<p>I am relatively new to Objective-C. </p>\n\n<p>I have come to a code on the web that has something like this on rootViewController.m (this is a navigationController based app).</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface RootViewController (CManagerDelegate) &lt;CManagerDelegate&gt;\n@end\n\n@interface RootViewController (PViewDelegate) &lt;PViewDelegate&gt;\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>two questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>what are these lines doing in the beginning of rootViewController.m</li>\n<li>what are these lines doing in code?

I get an empty body without any data and somewhere Restkit logs this, which indicates authorization problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-11-06 19:27:46.887 MyProject OAuth[22187:11603] I\n  restkit.network:RKRequest.m:689 Status Code: 401</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I realized that Restkit would not add any parameters in this way and hence the request is not aware of what signature, timestamp and OAuth version to use. Hence I tried the same using POST request where I can specify these parameters. Even now I get an empty body and the Restkit log says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-11-06 19:28:03.231 MyProject OAuth[22205:11603] I\n  restkit.network:RKRequest.m:689 Status Code: 404</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not know where I am going wrong or what else to try! Looking forward for help in resolving this issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nI implemented a missing callback method and now am getting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The request must be signed\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>message. I presume that the above setup should have been enough for OAuth authentication, as mentioned in the referred link, what else am I supposed to do?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Observations</em>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I could see the internals of RestKit code and the OAuth parameters are put into the HTTP header field of the URL request. But am not sure if Drupal 7 is capable of reading this information from the HTTP header field for it always returns me back:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The request must be signed</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means that the OAuth parameters are not received by Drupal in first case, otherwise it would have given me the following error at least:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Invalid Signature</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was looking for some other options to see if my consumer key and secret and all the other setup is done properly in the server side or not. To confirm this I downloaded the php OAuth client script from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/oauth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Download the SVN code from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/oauth/source/checkout\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In that when I cross check the requests with PHP client, my requests are all being served perfectly &amp; I get back the xml by just entering the endpoint, consumer key and consumer secret.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing I tried is to allow GCOAuth to generate the signature and all inside the Restkit and placed a breakpoint so that I can dump the HTTP header fields in a log and instead of Restkit sending the request to the server, I quickly prepared the URL request exactly in the same format as the above PHP client does. Now this request when triggered, I get back the</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Invalid Signature</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>response, does this also somehow mean that the OAuth parameters are not properly prepared in Restkit / GCOAuth?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nRaj</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","uitableview","recorder"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":0,"question_id":13283217,"title":"how to drag or drop multi uitableveiwcells on ios?","body":"<p>I want do drag a lot of selected cells and recorder them in my app.But I don't know how to do it.It seems apple just let u to drag one that what I have done it.\nidea?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":13278458,"title":"How do I set the next text field in focus for editing when the user hits return?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1347779/how-to-navigate-through-textfields-next-done-buttons\">How to navigate through textfields (Next / Done Buttons)</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9540500/ios-app-next-key-wont-go-to-the-next-text-field\">iOS app “next” key won’t go to the next text field</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two text fields in my view and I'd like the cursor to move from the email text field to the password text field when the user hits the return key.

I dont know how efficient/correct this way would be though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ISSUE :</strong> but before i refuge to the above solution, i want to know, can this notification happen from the server without my app trying to call or fetch the update from the server? I mean, my app comes into the picture only after the server sends a notification in the form of a msg or some xml or something.. </p>\n\n<p>Any help would be deeply appreciated. </p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ios6","iphone-5"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":147,"score":0,"question_id":13193011,"title":"purgeIdleCellConnections: found one to purge conn=0x1ddde360","body":"<p>I cannot find a proper solution to this problem. I think someone can help me to clear this bug.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong>\nWhen I use a 3G connection to test my app on the device, by the time the console shows this bug <code>\"purgeIdleCellConnections: found one to purge conn = 0x1ddde360\"</code> more than one time, it occurs with different number <code>(0x1ddde360 or 0x21b98a60 or....)</code>. Sometimes it hangs and the application crashes and dies. I cannot open the app. I have to delete and build again. When I use Wi-Fi it works fine: no problem at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Actual Results:</strong>\nI am using a web service(WSDL) in my app. While launching the application itself I am calling more than one web service. This app is already in the App Store (Promayarnlite) but that file was built using the IOS 5.1 SDK so it worked fine. Now I updated my Xcode to 4.5.1 and IOS 6 SDK, so I want to update my app in the App Store. I am struggling with this part.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A: Internally NSURLConnection maintains a connection cache.  Each cache entry represents a set of persistent HTTP connections to a host.  When a new request comes in, it is queued on an entry in the cache.  This may be an existing entry or it may be a new entry, and it may also generate a new HTTP connection within that entry, depending on various complex factors (the protection space, the authentication status [in the case of authentication methods--yes, I'm looking at you, NTLM!--that are stateful], pipelining, various cache limits, and so on).  When a connection associated with a cache entry finishes running all of its requests, it looks for more work on the cache entry's queue; if it doesn't find any the connection goes idle.  If the connection is idle for too long, the connection is purged (which closes the underlying TCP connection).</p>\n\n<p>This cache implementation has changed in iOS 6.  Prior to iOS 6 there was a single mechanism for purging idle cache entries, with radically different timeouts for Mac OS X and iOS (30 seconds versus 6 seconds, and the iOS value could be as low as 3 seconds on older versions of iOS).  In iOS 6 there are now two mechanisms for purging idle cache entries, one that applies to connections running over WWAN and one that applies to all other connections.  The WWAN timeout has dropped back to its traditional value (3 seconds) while the all-other-connections timeout has been bumped up to the old Mac OS X default (30 seconds).</p>\n\n<p>The log message you're seeing is generated when a WWAN connection is purged.  This log message didn't exist in iOS 5.x, which explains why you're not seeing it in your tests.  However the basic mechanism has been present, in one form or another, on all versions of iOS.</p>\n\n<p>This message is more likely to be a symptom than a cause.  Specifically the message only applies to idle connections; this is just NSURLConnection cleaning up persistent HTTP connections that aren't doing anything useful.  If you're having problems with your networking you need to investigate why the connections are going idle.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","email","twitter","phone"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12,"score":1,"question_id":13282442,"title":"How can I get the Twitter following and follower Email id and MobileNo in the iPhone sdk Using MGTwitterEngine?","body":"<p>I'm unable to get the Twitter following and Followers Email id and MobileNo i am using below code for that using below code i am able to get only Twitter following name and Id Please help?</p>\n\n<pre><code>if([[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]==nil)\n{\n    urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"https://api.twitter.com/1/friends/ids.json?cursor=-1&amp;user_id=%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"Userid\"]];\n}\nelse\n{\n    urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"https://api.twitter.com/1/followers/ids.json?cursor=-1&amp;user_id=%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]];\n}\n\n\nNSURLRequest *notificationRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]];\nNSHTTPURLResponse *response;\nNSError *error;\nNSData *responData;\n\nresponData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:notificationRequest returningResponse:&amp;response error:&amp;error];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",responData);\nNSString *dataString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:responData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\n//    NSDictionary *dict = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)[dataString JSONValue]];\n//    //   NSMutableDictionary *globalCelebDict=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]initWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary *)[dataString JSONValue ] ];\n//    //NSMutableDictionary *globalCelebDictNext=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]initWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary *)[[ globalCelebDict objectForKey:@\"GetGroupDetailsResult\"] JSONValue]];\n//    NSLog(@\"dict %@\",dict);\n\nSBJSON *json = [[SBJSON alloc] init];  \nNSMutableDictionary *customDetailDict=[[NSMutableDictionary alloc]init];\ncustomDetailDict=[json objectWithString:dataString error:&amp;error];\n//  NSDictionary *customDetailDict = [json objectWithString:dataString error:&amp;error];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",customDetailDict);\nif (customDetailDict!=nil) {\n    array=[[customDetailDict objectForKey:@\"ids\"]retain];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",array);\n\n    NSLog(@\"%d\",[array count]);\n    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]removeObjectForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\",[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]valueForKey:@\"UseridLoop\"]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","mkannotation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11,"score":0,"question_id":13282624,"title":"Pin animatesDrop mapView-iOS","body":"<p>I have implemented code as seen below.

There are no image files in the app at all (yet). I've been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and I'm looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.</p>\n\n<h1>Game Setup</h1>\n\n<p>At a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game (towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc) are also subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.</p>\n\n<p>I keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each object's state is updated in the main game loop (fired by an <code>NSTimer</code> at 60-240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting). The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.</p>\n\n<p>I handle view updates using a <code>CADisplayLink</code> timer at the native refresh rate (60 Hz), which calls <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override <code>drawRect:</code> to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapon's new state.</p>\n\n<h1>Performance Issues</h1>\n\n<p>Testing on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS (the target frame rate), usually into the 10-20 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Using Instruments I've determined that only roughly 5% of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state -- the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the <code>CGContextDrawPath</code> function (which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done) is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.</p>\n\n<p>From some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isn't up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive (especially when drawing things that aren't opaque and have some alpha value &lt; 1.0). I'm almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but it's pretty low level and I'm not really excited to have to use it -- it doesn't seem like it should be necessary for what I'm doing here.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphics?</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>Some Ideas...</h2>\n\n<p>Someone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single <code>CALayer</code> instead of having each object on its own <code>CALayer</code>, but I'm not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a theory that using <code>CGAffineTransforms</code> to do my animation (i.e. draw the object's shape(s) in <code>drawRect:</code> once, then do transforms to move/rotate/resize its layer in subsequent frames) would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I don't think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>To give you a feel for the level of drawing I'm doing, here's an example of the <code>drawRect:</code> implementation for one of my weapon objects (a \"beam\" fired from a tower).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: this beam can be \"retargeted\" and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n\n    // Draw beam\n    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(c, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor);\n    CGContextSetLineWidth(c, self.width);\n    CGContextMoveToPoint(c, self.origin.x, self.origin.y);\n    CGPoint vector = [TDBoard vectorFromPoint:self.origin toPoint:self.destination];\n    double magnitude = sqrt(pow(self.board.frame.size.width, 2) + pow(self.board.frame.size.height, 2));\n    CGContextAddLineToPoint(c, self.origin.x+magnitude*vector.x, self.origin.y+magnitude*vector.y);\n    CGContextStrokePath(c);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Instruments Run</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a while:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The <code>TDGreenBeam</code> class has the exact <code>drawRect:</code> implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2b1y3512341d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full Size Screenshot</a></strong>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSw3j.png\" alt=\"Instruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":16,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3123,"score":16,"question_id":8624519,"title":"Simulator slow-motion animations are now on?","body":"<p>A while ago I was experimenting, trying to see if see if i could get navigation items to animate and scroll between each other.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is related but suddenly without touching the simulator options I'm getting this message <code>Simulator slow-motion animations are now on</code> and moving between views is very slow, like a 3 seconds.

Right now I would like to do the same using ranges (ie i specify the range in time.. read a small chunk of audio as per the time, and then go back and read again). The reason why I want to use time range is b/c I want to control the size of each read (to fit in a packet with a max size). </p>\n\n<p>for some reason, there is always a bump between each read. In my code you'll notice that I start the AVAssetReader and end it every time I set a time range, and that's b/c I cannot dynamically adjust the time range after the reader has started (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5508619/how-to-seek-within-an-audio-track-using-avassetreader\">here</a> for more details).</p>\n\n<p>Could it be that starting and ending a reader is just too expensive to produce a continues real time experience? Or are other ways of doing this that I'm not aware of? </p>\n\n<p>Also note that this jitter or lag happens at whatever I set the time interval to be.. which makes me believe that starting and ending a reader the way I am is too expensive for real time audio playback.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) setupReader \n{\n    NSURL *assetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"ipod-library://item/item.m4a?id=1053020204400037178\"];

I just request that if you decide to lay out code or a code example to tell me where to put the code (ex: place this code in a new .h file and then link this code to the .m file)</p>\n\n<p>and an example project would be the most helpful! thanks! </p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","uiviewcontroller","uinavigationcontroller","uikit"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":0,"question_id":13253827,"title":"iOS - embedding a viewController on a navigationController","body":"<p>I have 3 view controllers, <code>vcA</code>, <code>vcB</code> and <code>vcC</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I am on <code>vcA</code> and push <code>vcB</code>.

Then in the Application UI I will show the list of stories of created by the writers and show corresponding prices for the stories as specified by the authors when they created the story. Once the user taps on the buy button, I will show the purchase for the generic consumable product of the same price and complete the in app purchase process. </p>\n\n<p>Now the question is will Apple approve of such implementation? Does it fit with their IAP policy? I am asking as I couldn't find a guideline for a workflow such as this. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach to implement this is by implementing an in app credit/currency system, like games use.

First I get the message in Xcode's output window:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Warning: Attempt to present UITabBarController on LoginVC while a\n  presentation is in progress!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And secondly, to test that the user was set correct, on the Profile screen (the first screen segued to)  have a label that has it's text set to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Welcome %@\",[[[API sharedInstance] user] objectForKey:@\"username\"]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it's a hit or miss whether the username actually appears or says (null) as shown:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sQ76d.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>You can also see a button I made there, to print to the output window the values of user.

Select an image in your image library, select \"Edit\", and crop the image. When you get the ALAsset you'll get the full image, and if you sync using iPhoto, iPhoto also pulls the full image.

Here's the code I am using, variation of some others I have found on SO.</p>\n\n<pre><code>        CLLocation *whereIAm = mapView.userLocation.location;\n\n        float lat = whereIAm.coordinate.latitude;\n        float lon = whereIAm.coordinate.longitude;\n\n\n        CLLocationCoordinate2D southWest = {[currentLatitude floatValue], [currentLongitude floatValue]};\n        CLLocationCoordinate2D northEast = southWest;\n\n        southWest.latitude = MIN(southWest.latitude, lat);\n        southWest.longitude = MIN(southWest.longitude, lon);\n\n        northEast.latitude = MAX(northEast.latitude, lat);\n        northEast.longitude = MAX(northEast.longitude, lon);\n\n        CLLocation *locSouthWest = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:southWest.latitude longitude:southWest.longitude];\n        CLLocation *locNorthEast = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:northEast.latitude longitude:northEast.longitude];\n\n        CLLocationDistance meters = [locSouthWest distanceFromLocation:locNorthEast];\n\n        MKCoordinateRegion region;\n        region.center.latitude = (southWest.latitude + northEast.latitude) / 2.0;\n        region.center.longitude = (southWest.longitude + northEast.longitude) / 2.0;\n        region.span.latitudeDelta = meters / 111319.5\n        region.span.longitudeDelta = 7.0;\n\n        MKCoordinateRegion savedRegion = [mapView regionThatFits:region];\n        [mapView setRegion:savedRegion animated:YES];\n\n        [locSouthWest release];\n        [locNorthEast release];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a better way built into MapKit to just zoom out so that both annotations have, lets say half an inch between them at the outer frame?  I don't really care if the user has to zoom in after, I just want it to zoom out properly.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","interface-builder"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13266560,"title":"X & Y coordinates of the main UIView are not 0,0 in inferface builder","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13191941/storyboard-weird-controller-view-frame-origins\">Storyboard weird controller view frame origins</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>in the following screenshot, the main view's X &amp; Y coordinates are supposed to be 0,0 (because it's simply the main view that sticks by default to screen bounds) why do they appear as 160, 294 ? </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/utaAt.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","interface-builder"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":44,"score":-1,"question_id":13266020,"title":"IOS: create UIs programatically or use Interface builder","body":"<p>we are building a little bigger mobile app in iOS. we need separate the components. there are two voices in team:\n1. use the interface builder, it is OK.\n2. programmatically, we can be good if any errors.</p>\n\n<p>is there any person who involved this and have experiences can share some hints?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","uinavigationbar","uibarbuttonitem","arrow"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":440,"score":3,"question_id":10763279,"title":"Programmatically draw back button with arrow?","body":"<p>Usually when you use a <code>UINavigationController</code> you get a back button that has an arrow on the left side of it.

It's a tab bar application for iPad set up in Xcode.  I added a tab bar item to the navigation bar in one of the view controllers.  When that button is pressed, the controller presents a popover that contains a navigation controller that has a very simple <code>UITableViewController</code> subclass, called <code>TestContentViewController</code>, as its root view controller.</p>\n\n<p>In <code>viewDidLoad</code> of that subclass, I randomly generate a number of items:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.numItems = arc4random() % 10 + 3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my number of rows; number of sections is 1.  In <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> I just set the cell's label text and return it.  When a row is selected, I generate another instance of the same class and push it on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Without doing anything at all with the <code>contentSizeForViewInPopover</code> property on any VC, the popover just goes to its maximum height and stays there no matter how many rows are in my table view.</p>\n\n<p>If I set the size in viewDidAppear, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.numItems * 44);\n  [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n{\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it flashes very quickly to full height and then snaps to the height I set.</li>\n<li>When a new controller is pushed on the navigation controller, it snaps to its height with no animation.</li>\n<li>When I navigate back, if the VC that I'm popping to is taller than the one I'm popping from, it animates to the correct size.  If what I'm popping to is smaller, it does nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing but in <code>viewWillAppear</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it's full-height</li>\n<li>When I first tap a row and get a new controller on the stack, it animates to a minimum of about 400px tall.  When a new controller is pushed on the stack, if it needs more height it gets it.  If not it stays at what it was before.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, it's basically the same as <code>viewWillAppear</code> except it appears at the right size at first.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried setting the nav controller's delegate to be the VC that presents the popover, and then set the popover's height (<code>setPopoverContentSize:animated:</code>) in <code>navigationController:didShowViewController:animated:</code>, but the resultant height is off by a little bit.  I think the size I set there needs to take into account the extra height of the navigation bar built into the top of the popover.  And the animation when pushing a new controller on the stack is weird.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","image","slider","resolution","settings.bundle"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13263239,"title":"Resolution of the Max Value Image in a Slider in Settings Bundle","body":"<p>Somebody said I should use a 21*21 image, but should I provide another 42*42 image for the retina display?

However, I haven't found any reference to the behavior I'm seeing anywhere, so I figured this is my best bet.</p>\n\n<p>I've got a trio of <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements set up as a date selection mechanism. There are some event handlers behind them to do things like update the list of days when the month or year change, but that's about it. The elements themselves are totally simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select class=\"day required\"&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"1\"&gt;01&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"2\"&gt;02&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"3\"&gt;03&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"4\"&gt;04&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"5\"&gt;05&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"6\"&gt;06&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"7\"&gt;07&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"8\"&gt;08&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"9\"&gt;09&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"10\"&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"11\"&gt;11&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"12\"&gt;12&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"13\"&gt;13&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"14\"&gt;14&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"15\"&gt;15&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"16\"&gt;16&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"17\"&gt;17&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"18\"&gt;18&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"19\"&gt;19&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"20\"&gt;20&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"21\"&gt;21&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"22\"&gt;22&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"23\"&gt;23&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"24\"&gt;24&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"25\"&gt;25&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"26\"&gt;26&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"27\"&gt;27&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"28\"&gt;28&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"29\"&gt;29&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"30\"&gt;30&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(copied straight out of the Chrome developer tools).  So that's the \"Day\" selection, and it's the one that's giving me bizarre behavior (sometimes) on iOS (and only iOS).</p>\n\n<p>When I tap on that <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> directly (the \"Day\", that is), there's no problem; it works just fine. However, when I tap first on the \"Month\" selection to its left, and then get to the \"Day\" by clicking the \"Next\" button in the pop-up Safari \"pick an option\" interface, then things get weird. What happens is that the option texts all show up, as usual.  If I \"roll\" the list up or down a ways such that the currently-selected option is not visible (so like, from day \"5\" to day \"15\"), and then click another selection, well that works insofar as the newly-selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> entry gets a checkmark by it, but if I roll the list back to the original one, it's still checked!  It's possible to repeat the process a few times to the point where there are checkmarks all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>When I click the blue \"Done\" button, only one entry is actually selected; you'll note that there's no \"multiple\" attribute on the element.  The same HTML works fine of course in desktop browsers and in Android; oddly enough, we've seen the same problem in Chrome on iOS.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried disabling the event handlers experimentally, but that has no effect. I've tried making jsfiddle/jsbin examples without success either.  The page this code appears on is not simple but it's not wildly complex; the most interesting thing about it is that the markup is all dynamically generated by a JavaScript template system, but that all works fine across all sorts of stuff without any comparable weirdness.</p>\n\n<p>Since I don't see console errors and it seems independent of whether I handle \"change\" events or not, <em>and</em> because it <em>only</em> happens when I get to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> in a certain way, I'm inclined to thing that this is just a corner-case bug with the low-level widget used by WebKit for <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements (on iOS), and not a problem with my code per se.  Of course, if there's a workaround I'd be delighted to try it, but none of the random alterations I've made so far have had any effect.</p>\n\n<p>Anybody else seen this?</p>\n\n<p><em>edit</em> another couple of details: when it's acting strangely, taps on the options always correctly update the element on the page.  Sometimes there's no \"click\" sound, but sometimes there is. When I click between options without rolling the list up or down, then within the subset of options I can see the widget starts working properly again, but non-visible options may remain checked.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","nsarray"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13260040,"title":"how to capture the first letter of each array entry","body":"<p>I have a sorted array of NSString values, I would like to know how to capture the first letter of each string only when the first letter is different and put it in a new NSArray.</p>\n\n<p>For instance if I have an array that was like like</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"a, aaa, aaaa, b, c, d, dd, ddd\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it would be like this in the new NSArray</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"a, b, c, d\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","ipad","video","itunes","picture"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9,"score":0,"question_id":13261230,"title":"videos in picture library...is there a way to keep the videos from being shared?","body":"<p>I have videos in my picture library that i added with iTunes this videos are then pulled locally to my Ipad mini (idk if it matters) app. </p>\n\n<p>The app is for a classroom setting the problem is that who ever has the app can share the videos from the picture library.. is there a way to prevent the videos from being passed along/stolen.. can I encrypt them? </p>\n\n<p>could i not simply use the video library instead? i've gone this way but when the videos are opened in the app the photo library opens and plays there.  </p>\n\n<p>please any suggestions are gratefully received.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13260787,"title":"setDefaultTimeZone not working","body":"<p>I'm adding the following line to my <code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions</code> expecting to get the right time for Brasil but it does not seems to work.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[NSTimeZone setDefaultTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation:@\"BRT\"]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-11-06 22:45:13 +0000 // wrong time\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any tips?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","core-bluetooth","peripherals"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":364,"score":3,"question_id":13041930,"title":"Run iOS 6 device as a BLE peripheral","body":"<p>As we know, iOS 6 support running devices (iPhone 4s and above, and new iPad) as a BLE peripheral.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","sql","phonegap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":0,"question_id":13253228,"title":"Get resultSet keys in phonegap?","body":"<p>With say 5 fields in the DB, I know the columns that can be queried and use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getDetails_success (tx, results) {\n    var len = results.rows.length;\n\n    for (var i=0; i&lt;len; i++) {\n\n        var content = results.rows.item(i);\n        buf += '&lt;tr '+ content.OID+'&gt;';\n        buf += '&lt;tr '+ content.KID+'&gt;';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on.</p>\n\n<p>What if I have 50 fields, of which 5 random fields has to be displayed.

I set a breakpoint in each one, started my app with xcode in the simulator but still get the error and the Breakpoints don't get hit. </p>\n\n<p>BackendConnector.m</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"BackendConnector.h\"\n\n@implementation BackendConnector\n\n@synthesize dataPoint, chartDataPoints;\n\n- (NSMutableArray *)GetWebserviceData\n{\n    NSMutableData *myMutableData;\n    chartDataPoints = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n\n    [self createWebserviceAndGetResponse: &amp;myMutableData];\n\n    if (myMutableData != NULL)\n    {\n        NSString *theXml = [[NSString alloc]initWithBytes:[myMutableData mutableBytes] length:[myMutableData length] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\n        NSLog(@\"doc = %@\", theXml);\n\n        arrayCount = 0;\n        [self parseResponse: myMutableData];\n    }\n    else \n    {\n        UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Error\" \n                                                        message:@\"There is no Data returned from Webservice!\"\n                                                       delegate:nil \n                                              cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" \n                                              otherButtonTitles: nil];\n        [alert show];\n        [alert release];\n}\n\n    return NULL;\n    //return chartDataPoints;\n}\n\n- (void) createWebserviceAndGetResponse: (NSMutableData **) myMutableData_p  \n{\n    NSMutableString *sRequest = [[NSMutableString alloc]init];\n\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\\\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\\\" xmlns:ser=\\\"http://service.ReportWebservice.xyz.com/\\\"&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;soapenv:Body&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;ser:getReport&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;arg0&gt;User/arg0&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;arg1&gt;password&lt;/arg1&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;/ser:getReport&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;\"];\n    [sRequest appendString:@\"&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;\"];\n\n    NSURL *myWebserverURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://xyz.com/services/report\"];\n\n    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:myWebserverURL]; \n    NSLog(@\"request: %@\", request);\n\n    [request addValue:@\"text/xml; charset=utf-8\" forHTTPHeaderField:@\"Content-Type\"];\n    [request addValue:@\"\" forHTTPHeaderField:@\"SOAPAction\"];\n\n    NSString *contentLengthStr = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%d\", [sRequest length]];\n\n    [request addValue:contentLengthStr forHTTPHeaderField:@\"Content-Length\"];\n    [request setHTTPMethod:@\"POST\"];\n    [request setHTTPBody:[sRequest dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];\n\n    NSURLConnection *conn = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self];\n\n    if(conn)\n    {\n        *myMutableData_p=[[NSMutableData data] retain];\n    }\n\n    [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request delegate:self];\n\n    NSError *WSerror;\n    NSURLResponse *WSresponse;\n\n    *myMutableData_p = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:request returningResponse:&amp;WSresponse error:&amp;WSerror];\n}\n\n- (BOOL)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace:(NSURLProtectionSpace *)protectionSpace {\n    return [protectionSpace.authenticationMethod isEqualToString:NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust];\n}\n\n- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:(NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge {\n    [challenge.sender useCredential:[NSURLCredential credentialForTrust:challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust] forAuthenticationChallenge:challenge];\n    [challenge.sender continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge:challenge];\n}\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Error is: </p>\n\n<p>Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1202 \"The certificate for this server is invalid.

Usually, there are enough results that the bottom of the table is no longer visible on the screen. All is well, until I try to scroll the table. When that happens, no scroll bar appears on the right edge of the screen, and the table doesn't move on a one-to-one scale with my finger movement.

This does not seem to be what all these other alarms are doing as they do not keep on running if you press home BTN.

(Which is what I need)</p>\n\n<p>Also, When you ask how much time you have left running you get aprox 10 min. By dropping an infinite loop in there the numbers will actually run down to 0 and then go into the negatives for hours on end.(tested) Im not sure how this would behave in the real world or in terms of app acceptance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>B.

For example, the XML in the .storyboard file has its starting <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> tag's <code>toolsVersion</code> and <code>systemVersion</code> attributes altered by whatever configuration the most recent file manipulator happens to be running. Synchronizing everybody's Xcode versions precisely seems to help with <code>toolsVersion</code>, but <code>systemVersion</code> changes no matter what, depending on the specific Mac and/or OS X version the developer is running.</p>\n\n<p>This is idiotic, but mostly harmless. What worries us, though, is that at other times some other changes are automatically made to the storyboard just by opening them after a <code>git pull</code>. That is to say, Alice makes changes to a storyboard, commits and pushes them to the repository. Bob then pulls Alice's changes and opens up the storyboard to make further changes. The moment he opens the storyboard, the file icon immediately changes to a modified-but-unsaved state, and a <code>git status</code> shows that any number of weird changes have occurred. All this without Bob having changed anything or saved the file himself.</p>\n\n<p>The most common automated change we're seeing is the disappearance or reappearance of the entire <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> tag hierachy near the end of a storyboard file. We haven't figured out what is causing this. We may have several localized versions of a storyboard in various .lproj directories, and when opening them inside Interface Builder, the class hierarchy may spontaneously be removed from some and added into others, or left alone in some. This causes a lot of noise in <code>git diff</code>, but it doesn't actually break any functionality. We will often selectively add the actual changes we made into git's index, commit those, and then just discard the spontaneous, nonsensical <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> changes. This is to keep commits small and nice, as they should be. Eventually, though, it just becomes too much to bother with since Xcode keeps re-doing the changes, and someone just ragecommits them along with some other stuff... which is fine until someone else's Xcode decides to want to change them back for no apparent reason.

There's scroll views for Leaderboards and Achievements (and others that aren't currently relevant), and in each of them, it's possible to scroll, but it's as though it never gets any touch ended events. When you let go, the content just stays where it was, even if it's outside the view - it doesn't bounce back. When you touch again, it jumps back instantly, and is scrollable again.</p>\n\n<p>The bigger problem caused by this though, is that you can't normally select anything in the scroll views (I guess they're selected with a touch ended event).

Now the problem is with recording of those notes. As I mentioned I have many instruments, I need to record each instrument sound separately. So, I tried to save the midi note numbers into an array for each instrument. The problem now is I have to mix all of those sounds (ideally with out replaying them through a mixer) and create a music file out of them. One tedious way I could think of is to have each instrument recorded separately into a music file when the midi tone is played itself and finally mix all instrument music files by adding up. But the user may delay some instrument tunes etc and then, I am finding it pretty hard to mix. Also, I was unable to find a proper way with which I can mix audio files of various lengths, and delays before them. Can anyone please let me know if there is a way I can generate an audio file from the midi note numbers for various instruments without having to play them through the multi channel mixer and wait until the all the sounds are done playing through the mixer to record them?

I have this issue where I am using a class to store global information that is needed through out the code because it stores the list of food that a user adds to their meal plan. The issue that I have is that one it is a relatively large data structure that I am using. The data structure is a dictionary with keys to five other dictionaries that all have 8 mutable arrays that can be as large as the user wishes due to the fact that can add as much food as their heart desires.</p>\n\n<p>I have set the structure like so</p>\n\n<pre><code>mealInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]\n[mealInfo setObject:[NSMutableDictionary dictionary] forKey:\"foo\"];\n[[mealInfo objectForKey:\"such\"] setObject: [NSMutableArray array] forKey:\"bar\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is repeated for the complete data structure. This did seem to solve some of my possible memory leaks when I analyzed in xcode. The issue is further then that cause I have an idea what the issue is just not the solution. I have objects created, which create this structure in the local scope of the .m file I am in. I go save this structure in the class where mealInfo is created, not the local scope, with a static object of that class. (<em>I am not using too much code because it is one in a lot of locations and two is way too many lines</em>)</p>\n\n<p>After I save to the static variable of the class I release the local scope, I can not release the mealInfo because when I have done that in the past it actually causes the object to disappear and nil in the class that it was initialized in making it inaccessible to other classes trying to access this information. </p>\n\n<p>One solution I thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getters and setters, but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times. This I was trying to avoid. I will do that if that is the only solution, but would like to get this method to work first. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is not too confusing. I also hope someone might have a solution to this memory leak.

The User-Agent the iPhone Simulator 6 is presenting is (iPhone Simulator; ios 6.0; Scale/2.00). </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to either allow this User-Agent on IIS 7 or change the User-Agent in the iPhone simulator? </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else seen this issue?\nThanks in advance,\nEd</p>\n\n<p>Update----</p>\n\n<p>Hi Everyone\nOk so I figured out how to change the User-Agent and Content-Type using the NSMutableURLRequest.  I changed these to match what the browser would send, FireFox browser, and tried again to no avail.  I still believe there is an issue with the configuration of IIS 7.5 but I can not find it...\nThanks for anyones help!!!\nEd</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","game-center"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13223891,"title":"Game Center unable to load score in iOS6","body":"<p>I have been using the apple example GKTapper (from 2010) to manage scores for a long time.

I have a iPhone App that I have been updating for over a year and it has been working just fine on my iPad2, iPhone 3GS, as well as the 4G, 4GS, and 5. However, just recently I obtained an iPad3 to test the App on. Something very strange happens: When the App is loaded through Xcode in development it comes up and looks perfect - however, <strong>it won't respond to any touches at all</strong>. I have an alert that pops up on load and you can close that, but the actual main view controller will not react to any drag or touch gestures - it is essentially frozen. However! <strong>When I rotate the device and the App rotates correctly, it suddenly starts working just fine,</strong> even if I rotate it back! The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal. Here is what I have been able to confirm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad3 device: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-retina sim: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-normal sim: <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n<li>iPad2 device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-retina sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-normal sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4S device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4 device: normal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If all the iPhones worked and the iPads didn't, it would make some sense. But my ipad2 works just fine. Also, if I use the iPad3 open it, it is frozen. BUT! <strong>If I hit the 2X button, it starts working</strong> again even without rotation.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to test and see if it would work as a Universal App. On the iPad3 <strong>when I switch it over to Universal, it works just fine to begin with</strong>. So something weird must be going on with the simulator.

Or can we create a new string for which we are able to set this information?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The explanation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In iOS 6, you can toggle a selection as bold or italic. But the way this works is vexing: it does not change the NSFontAttributeName that Apple has exposed to us (changing the font name from, for instance, \"HelveticaNeue\" to \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\"). Instead, it preserves the font-family as \"Helvetica Neue\" and changes the \"font-weight\" to bold in the style string. If you were to ask an instance of attributed text for its description, you would see something like this for its font information:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSFont = \"&lt;UICFFont: 0x1fbc53a0&gt; font-family: \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\"; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-size: 16px\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This creates a problem. We cannot change the font while preserving bold and italic style information. If you jump through the hoops of scanning the old attributed string for style info, creating a new string with a new font, and then changing the font attribute name (using, for instance, \"Courier-Bold\" for everywhere you want it to be bold), you create a new problem: if you try to toggle the font back to normal (not bold) you will instead have a font name like \"Courier-Bold\" <em>AND</em> a font-weight of \"bold\", because the style information was not yet set to bold. And toggling will not, of course, change the font name. So you've essentially created a font that can no longer be changed when the user toggles the selected text. The user will press the \"bold\" button in the contextual menu, but it will do nothing, because the boldness has now been hardcoded into the font name, you might say.</p>\n\n<p>If you go the other route and try to override \"toggleBoldface\" and \"toggleItalic\" in your UITextView, it does not seem possible to actually prevent the style information in the style string from being changed. You cannot, it seems, change the font name alone during the toggle event.</p>\n\n<p>So, again, the question: can we just access the font-weight and font-style information directly somehow? Or can we create a new string for which we are able to set this information? This would solve the problem of trying to switch from one font to another and preserving style info.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And a double clarification:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are talking about iOS. When you set an attributed string's font attribute (NSFontAttributeName) for some range of characters, internally iOS creates an NSFont with a style string. The style string will read \"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal\" if you have set a font attribute yourself. But this style string is where the bold and italic information set in a UITextView (by toggling) is stored.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ipod-touch","iphone-5"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":13136475,"title":"Can iOS appllication be deployed on iPod touch device?","body":"<p>I'm working on iOS application that is intended for iPhone 5.

Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField.

The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach. Even worse, I will have to keep a track of the index where the cell should appear when it translates from one section to another.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have 8 cells in section 1 and 2. 4 cells of second section appear as hidden in the first section and vice versa. When the user presses + in one section A, its property should be set to hidden in section A and it should be made visible in section B. However, when the cell's property is set to hidden, a void is created in its place which looks very ugly. Is there a way to fill the void? Also, if I use a grouped cells, the remaining cell at the end of section will not have rounded bottom corners.</p></li>\n<li><p>User can drag cells from one section to another.

Upon researching this, here on SO, I saw a couple different questions relating to having targets that were still set to build armv6 under Xcode 4.5. I checked my Xcode settings, and for both the product and my one compiled target (I have 3 or 4 script targets) \"Valid Architectures\" is set to \"armv7, armv7s\". I remember having to mess with this when I upgraded to Xcode 4.5, and I think I changed it then. I am building Cocos2d as a sub-project and I checked it as well. The only other archive I have is the libTestFlight.a, which is of course pre-built. I unzipped my IPA, looked in the Info.plist, and CFBundleExecutable is in fact missing, though Bundle Name, Bundle Display Name, and Executable File are all there and correct. What else could cause this? Could there be a problem with codesigning or my Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile? I have made some changes to make my bundle identifier consistent with my App ID on iTunes Connect (a case-sensitivity issue). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did in fact have a correct CFBundleExecutable. I was using PListEdit Pro to look at the Info.plist, and what it was reporting as \"Executable File\" was really CFBundleExecutable. I also took my ad-hoc signed IPA and used Xcode organizer to install it on my device, and it runs just fine, so there is no problem with the IPA, other than the TestFlight desktop app cannot find the dSYM in it. I unpacked the IPA, and it does seem that the dSYM is missing. I looked in the .xcarchive I built the IPA from, and the dSYM is present in there, so it looks like it is being stripped out by the codesigning step, perhaps? I extracted the dSYM from the xcarchive and attempted to upload it with my IPA to TestFlight.

The base for all of my calculations is the width of the content view. This is how the beginning of my implementation of <code>layoutSubviews</code> looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) layoutSubviews\n{\n  [super layoutSubviews];  // invoke this to set up the content view's bounds\n\n  CGFloat contentViewWidth = self.contentView.bounds.size.width;\n\n  [...]  // calculate and assign frames to subviews\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have started testing this in a grouped table view in the iPhone simulator. The cell is supposed to consist of only what's inside the content view, i.e. I have turned off all the surrounding fancy stuff. Specifically, I have disabled the accessory view by setting the accessory type to <code>UITableViewCellAccessoryNone</code>. Due to this, the accessory view is hidden, although its bounds/frame properties still report a size of 20/20.</p>\n\n<p>Based on all this, and the following simple illustration, I would expect the content view width in the above code snippet to be reported as 300.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;----------- screen width = 320 -----------&gt;\n+------------------------------------------+\n|                                          |\n|    &lt;--- content view width = 300 ---&gt;    |\n|    +--------------------------------+    |\n|&lt;--&gt;|         table view cell        |&lt;--&gt;|\n| 10 +--------------------------------+ 10 |\n|                                          |\n|                  [...]                   |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it's not, the content view width that is actually reported is 270!</p>\n\n<p>A bit of research shows that the 30 missing points are comprised of a) 20 width of the accessory view, and b) 10 spacing between content view and accessory view. I tried setting the accessory view size to 0/0, the effect was that the content view width is now reported as 290. Slightly better, but still 10 points off. I also tried setting the <code>accessoryView</code> property to <code>nil</code>, but the view is simply re-created by <code>[super layoutSubviews]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the question: Is there a way to <strong>really</strong> disable the accessory view so that it is not included in the calculation of the content view width? Alternatively, would it be safe to skip invoking <code>[super layoutSubviews]</code> and simply calculate the width myself?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","objective-c-blocks"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13224093,"title":"ObjectiveC: Passing method parameter to a block inside a block?","body":"<p>I have a method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)myMethod:(NSError *)error\n{\n    [[self.data allKeys] enumerateUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop){\n        __block NSString *channelName = obj;\n        NSArray *subArray = [self.data objectForKey:obj];\n        [subArray enumerateUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop){\n            Wrapper *wrapper = obj;\n            [wrapper handleError:error forChannel:channelName];\n        }];\n    }];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1) Do I need to use different names for parameters obj, idx and stop for the inner block?</p>\n\n<p>2) Do I need or not need to define channelName as __block?</p>\n\n<p>3) Do I need to define a weak self outside all blocks and use it in blocks?</p>\n\n<p>edit:</p>\n\n<p><code>channelName</code> is used by inner block, and is passed to the handler block.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ipad"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":738,"score":2,"question_id":9167991,"title":"iOS icon breaks app validation","body":"<p>I have an iPad app that I submitted to Apple successfully using my personal Apple Developer account.

When I set the TintColor on [UINavigationBar appearance] it will change the colors, but that only takes a UIColor.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to either set the default navigation back button image (without manually changing every viewcontroller) or convert an image into a UIColor?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: ANSWER IS BELOW</p>\n\n<p>Apparently UIBarButtonItem has a separate function for the backbutton customization. I had to create another image for the back button based off navbar_btn.png and set it using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:backButtonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","cocoa","uiscrollview","paging"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":2,"question_id":13218732,"title":"Scrolling when UIScrollView inside UIScrollView","body":"<p>I want to put a second UIScrollView inside of the first page of another UIScrollView.\nTo scroll to page 2 of the first UIScrollView I now have to swipe right above oder below the second UIScrollView.
