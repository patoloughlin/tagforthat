There are no image files in the app at all (yet). I've been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and I'm looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.</p>\n\n<h1>Game Setup</h1>\n\n<p>At a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game (towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc) are also subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.</p>\n\n<p>I keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each object's state is updated in the main game loop (fired by an <code>NSTimer</code> at 60-240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting). The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.</p>\n\n<p>I handle view updates using a <code>CADisplayLink</code> timer at the native refresh rate (60 Hz), which calls <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override <code>drawRect:</code> to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapon's new state.</p>\n\n<h1>Performance Issues</h1>\n\n<p>Testing on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS (the target frame rate), usually into the 10-20 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Using Instruments I've determined that only roughly 5% of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state -- the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the <code>CGContextDrawPath</code> function (which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done) is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.</p>\n\n<p>From some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isn't up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive (especially when drawing things that aren't opaque and have some alpha value &lt; 1.0). I'm almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but it's pretty low level and I'm not really excited to have to use it -- it doesn't seem like it should be necessary for what I'm doing here.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphics?</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>Some Ideas...</h2>\n\n<p>Someone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single <code>CALayer</code> instead of having each object on its own <code>CALayer</code>, but I'm not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a theory that using <code>CGAffineTransforms</code> to do my animation (i.e. draw the object's shape(s) in <code>drawRect:</code> once, then do transforms to move/rotate/resize its layer in subsequent frames) would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I don't think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>To give you a feel for the level of drawing I'm doing, here's an example of the <code>drawRect:</code> implementation for one of my weapon objects (a \"beam\" fired from a tower).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: this beam can be \"retargeted\" and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n\n    // Draw beam\n    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(c, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor);\n    CGContextSetLineWidth(c, self.width);\n    CGContextMoveToPoint(c, self.origin.x, self.origin.y);\n    CGPoint vector = [TDBoard vectorFromPoint:self.origin toPoint:self.destination];\n    double magnitude = sqrt(pow(self.board.frame.size.width, 2) + pow(self.board.frame.size.height, 2));\n    CGContextAddLineToPoint(c, self.origin.x+magnitude*vector.x, self.origin.y+magnitude*vector.y);\n    CGContextStrokePath(c);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Instruments Run</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a while:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The <code>TDGreenBeam</code> class has the exact <code>drawRect:</code> implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2b1y3512341d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full Size Screenshot</a></strong>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSw3j.png\" alt=\"Instruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","nsmutablearray","plist","nsmutabledictionary"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13281528,"title":"Accessing NSMutableDictionary inside NSMutableArray","body":"<p>I have an <code>NSMutableArray</code> of <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> (it's a plist).

Let's say we have an app in which professional writers write stories from a web based UI. And then these stories become available for user of the iOS app as in app purchase items.</p>\n\n<p>As you may know we need to create in app purchase products in advance. But in our situations it means that for each of the story created by the writers we will have to create a new IAP product and wait for Apple to approve it.</p>\n\n<p>To circumvent this, I am planning to create generic \"consumable\" products in IAP like story worth $1.99, story worth $2.99, so on, so forth. Then in the Application UI I will show the list of stories of created by the writers and show corresponding prices for the stories as specified by the authors when they created the story. Once the user taps on the buy button, I will show the purchase for the generic consumable product of the same price and complete the in app purchase process. </p>\n\n<p>Now the question is will Apple approve of such implementation? Does it fit with their IAP policy? I am asking as I couldn't find a guideline for a workflow such as this. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach to implement this is by implementing an in app credit/currency system, like games use. Where people buy credits/coins and then they purchase items with coins. This is a tried and tested approach but it doesn't fit in my analogy of the app, hence the question.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","facebook"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13275231,"title":"Facebook friend's wall posting","body":"<p>When the user logs in in facebook on my applicaiton, they are able to access their friend's list, select friends and then press on done.

I have to scroll more and I will be able to see it but it goes back up again to 3/4. Its kind of like the scroll to refresh, where the view only moves if you drag it and when you leave it bumps back to where it was. Why is this happening?

So this is the game accelerometer delegate method which sets rollingX equal to everything and then I move the character based upon rollingX:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) accelerometer:(UIAccelerometer *)accelerometer didAccelerate:(UIAcceleration *)acceleration {\n    rollingX = ((acceleration.x - calibrationFloat) * kFilteringFactor) + (rollingX * (1.0 - kFilteringFactor));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However this is not working, the calibration doesn't seem to do anything and I am not sure why. Does anyone set why this wouldn't be working?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","cocoa-touch","uiwebview"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":2,"question_id":13261713,"title":"How to create Tap event on Long Tap gesture on UIWebView?","body":"<p>I have added Long Tap gesture on <code>UIWebView</code>.

The settings window is a subclass of <code>UITableViewController</code> (style set to grouped), and tapping any of its cells pushes different \"chooser\" view controllers on the nav controller that are also subclasses of <code>UITableViewController</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For each of the chooser views, in <code>viewDidAppear</code>, I'm setting <code>contentSizeForViewInPopover</code> appropriately:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.items.count * 44);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it doesn't animate the change; when the navigation animation finishes, the popover snaps to the new height (width never changes from 320).  Navigating backward animates the size change (accomplished with the technique from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/5032887/412107\">this answer</a>), but forward never does.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried obtaining a reference to the popover it's in and using <code>setPopoverContentSize:animated:</code> but it doesn't work.

It's a tab bar application for iPad set up in Xcode.  I added a tab bar item to the navigation bar in one of the view controllers.  When that button is pressed, the controller presents a popover that contains a navigation controller that has a very simple <code>UITableViewController</code> subclass, called <code>TestContentViewController</code>, as its root view controller.</p>\n\n<p>In <code>viewDidLoad</code> of that subclass, I randomly generate a number of items:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.numItems = arc4random() % 10 + 3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my number of rows; number of sections is 1.  In <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> I just set the cell's label text and return it.  When a row is selected, I generate another instance of the same class and push it on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Without doing anything at all with the <code>contentSizeForViewInPopover</code> property on any VC, the popover just goes to its maximum height and stays there no matter how many rows are in my table view.</p>\n\n<p>If I set the size in viewDidAppear, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.numItems * 44);\n  [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n{\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it flashes very quickly to full height and then snaps to the height I set.</li>\n<li>When a new controller is pushed on the navigation controller, it snaps to its height with no animation.</li>\n<li>When I navigate back, if the VC that I'm popping to is taller than the one I'm popping from, it animates to the correct size.  If what I'm popping to is smaller, it does nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing but in <code>viewWillAppear</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it's full-height</li>\n<li>When I first tap a row and get a new controller on the stack, it animates to a minimum of about 400px tall.  When a new controller is pushed on the stack, if it needs more height it gets it.  If not it stays at what it was before.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, it's basically the same as <code>viewWillAppear</code> except it appears at the right size at first.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried setting the nav controller's delegate to be the VC that presents the popover, and then set the popover's height (<code>setPopoverContentSize:animated:</code>) in <code>navigationController:didShowViewController:animated:</code>, but the resultant height is off by a little bit.  I think the size I set there needs to take into account the extra height of the navigation bar built into the top of the popover.  And the animation when pushing a new controller on the stack is weird.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","image","slider","resolution","settings.bundle"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13263239,"title":"Resolution of the Max Value Image in a Slider in Settings Bundle","body":"<p>Somebody said I should use a 21*21 image, but should I provide another 42*42 image for the retina display?

So that's the \"Day\" selection, and it's the one that's giving me bizarre behavior (sometimes) on iOS (and only iOS).</p>\n\n<p>When I tap on that <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> directly (the \"Day\", that is), there's no problem; it works just fine. However, when I tap first on the \"Month\" selection to its left, and then get to the \"Day\" by clicking the \"Next\" button in the pop-up Safari \"pick an option\" interface, then things get weird. What happens is that the option texts all show up, as usual.  If I \"roll\" the list up or down a ways such that the currently-selected option is not visible (so like, from day \"5\" to day \"15\"), and then click another selection, well that works insofar as the newly-selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> entry gets a checkmark by it, but if I roll the list back to the original one, it's still checked!  It's possible to repeat the process a few times to the point where there are checkmarks all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>When I click the blue \"Done\" button, only one entry is actually selected; you'll note that there's no \"multiple\" attribute on the element.  The same HTML works fine of course in desktop browsers and in Android; oddly enough, we've seen the same problem in Chrome on iOS.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried disabling the event handlers experimentally, but that has no effect. I've tried making jsfiddle/jsbin examples without success either.  The page this code appears on is not simple but it's not wildly complex; the most interesting thing about it is that the markup is all dynamically generated by a JavaScript template system, but that all works fine across all sorts of stuff without any comparable weirdness.</p>\n\n<p>Since I don't see console errors and it seems independent of whether I handle \"change\" events or not, <em>and</em> because it <em>only</em> happens when I get to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> in a certain way, I'm inclined to thing that this is just a corner-case bug with the low-level widget used by WebKit for <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements (on iOS), and not a problem with my code per se.  Of course, if there's a workaround I'd be delighted to try it, but none of the random alterations I've made so far have had any effect.</p>\n\n<p>Anybody else seen this?</p>\n\n<p><em>edit</em> another couple of details: when it's acting strangely, taps on the options always correctly update the element on the page.  Sometimes there's no \"click\" sound, but sometimes there is. When I click between options without rolling the list up or down, then within the subset of options I can see the widget starts working properly again, but non-visible options may remain checked.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","nsarray"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":13260040,"title":"how to capture the first letter of each array entry","body":"<p>I have a sorted array of NSString values, I would like to know how to capture the first letter of each string only when the first letter is different and put it in a new NSArray.</p>\n\n<p>For instance if I have an array that was like like</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"a, aaa, aaaa, b, c, d, dd, ddd\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it would be like this in the new NSArray</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"a, b, c, d\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","ipad","video","itunes","picture"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13261230,"title":"videos in picture library...is there a way to keep the videos from being shared?","body":"<p>I have videos in my picture library that i added with iTunes this videos are then pulled locally to my Ipad mini (idk if it matters) app. </p>\n\n<p>The app is for a classroom setting the problem is that who ever has the app can share the videos from the picture library.. is there a way to prevent the videos from being passed along/stolen.. can I encrypt them? </p>\n\n<p>could i not simply use the video library instead? i've gone this way but when the videos are opened in the app the photo library opens and plays there.  </p>\n\n<p>please any suggestions are gratefully received.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13260787,"title":"setDefaultTimeZone not working","body":"<p>I'm adding the following line to my <code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions</code> expecting to get the right time for Brasil but it does not seems to work.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[NSTimeZone setDefaultTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation:@\"BRT\"]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-11-06 22:45:13 +0000 // wrong time\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any tips?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","core-bluetooth","peripherals"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":357,"score":3,"question_id":13041930,"title":"Run iOS 6 device as a BLE peripheral","body":"<p>As we know, iOS 6 support running devices (iPhone 4s and above, and new iPad) as a BLE peripheral.

I'm interested in finding out the Apple-blessed / most elegant way of achieving this that will lead to the least amount of pain down the road as the app grows. Some approaches I've looked into so far:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> I changed the background / height of the navigation bar by applying an image through [UINavigationBar appearance], seems to have worked fine.</p>\n\n<pre><code>UIImage *navBarImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"navigation-bar.png\"];\n\n[[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage:navBarImage\n                                   forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Seems like the most \"modern\" way of achieving background/height change, although it most likely doesn't survive an orientation change. Any improvements that could be made here?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> I replaced the default back button with the following in the viewDidLoad of the pushed view</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Set the custom back button\nUIImage *buttonImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"back.png\"];\n\n//create the button and assign the image\nUIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];\n[button setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\n\n//set the frame of the button to the size of the image (see note below)\nbutton.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, buttonImage.size.width, buttonImage.size.height);\n\n[button addTarget:self action:@selector(back) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];\n\n// offset the back button\nbutton.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 5, -10, -5);\n\n//create a UIBarButtonItem with the button as a custom view\nUIBarButtonItem *customBarItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:button];\nself.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = customBarItem;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not very pleased with this solution because it leaves customization of the bar to the controller on top of the navigation stack. <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UINavigationController_Class/Reference/Reference.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">From the Apple docs</a> it would seem like they'd prefer you to subclass the UINavigationBar altogether and replace it once and for all in the navigation controller: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can also specify a custom UINavigationBar subclass by using the initWithNavigationBarClass:toolbarClass: method to initialize the navigation controller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Would that be the advised route? I was NOT able to replace the default Back button of the UINavigationBar through [UIBarButtonItem appearance] as it still attempts to display text in the button, and when you remove the text, the button isn't displayed at all. Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> The page title should be replaceable with another view through navigationItem.titleView.

I tagged textfields and added them in this array in text field delegate method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (BOOL) textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)textField {\n    FDTextFieldCell *cell = (FDTextFieldCell *)[textField superview];\n    NSIndexPath *indexPath = [[self tableView] indexPathForCell:cell];\n\n    if ([indexPath section] == 0) {\n        if ([indexPath row] == 0) {\n            [[FDProfile sharedProfile] setName:[textField text]];\n            [textField setTag:1];\n            [textFieldsArray insertObject:textField atIndex:0];\n        } else if ([indexPath row] == 1) {\n            [[FDProfile sharedProfile] setSurname:[textField text]];\n            [textField setTag:2];\n            [textFieldsArray insertObject:textField atIndex:1];\n        } else if ([indexPath row] == 2) {\n            [[FDProfile sharedProfile] setNickname:[textField text]];\n            [textField setTag:3];\n            [textFieldsArray insertObject:textField atIndex:2];\n        } else if ([indexPath row] == 3) {\n            [[FDProfile sharedProfile] setEmail:[textField text]];\n            [textField setTag:4];\n            [textFieldsArray insertObject:textField atIndex:3];\n            [textField resignFirstResponder];\n        }\n    }\n\n    [[self tableView] reloadData];\n    return YES;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now i try to improve functionality of button \"Next\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:(FDInputAccessoryView *)view {\n    for (UITextField *textField in [self textFieldsArray]) {\n        if ([textField isFirstResponder]) {\n     textField = [[self textFieldsArray] objectAtIndex:textField.tag + 1];\n            [textField becomeFirstResponder];\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this code doesn't works. I think there is an issue with using fast enumeration? </p>\n\n<p>Can somebody help with this?\nThanks, Alex.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some ideas to solving from c-had:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you setting up your textFieldsArray in textFieldShouldReturn:? Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","sql","phonegap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":0,"question_id":13253228,"title":"Get resultSet keys in phonegap?","body":"<p>With say 5 fields in the DB, I know the columns that can be queried and use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getDetails_success (tx, results) {\n    var len = results.rows.length;\n\n    for (var i=0; i&lt;len; i++) {\n\n        var content = results.rows.item(i);\n        buf += '&lt;tr '+ content.OID+'&gt;';\n        buf += '&lt;tr '+ content.KID+'&gt;';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on.</p>\n\n<p>What if I have 50 fields, of which 5 random fields has to be displayed.

This does not seem to be what all these other alarms are doing as they do not keep on running if you press home BTN. Which suggest that they use some method that gives them permission to run while locked but not in the BG. (Which is what I need)</p>\n\n<p>Also, When you ask how much time you have left running you get aprox 10 min. By dropping an infinite loop in there the numbers will actually run down to 0 and then go into the negatives for hours on end.(tested) Im not sure how this would behave in the real world or in terms of app acceptance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>B. Use a silent audio loop to pose as a continus audio playing media center</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Worked when locked, and will keep up running in most situations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can fail if interrupted by another media center and in some other occasions.</li>\n<li>Can also go agains apple policy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This can work I a lot of situations but is by far not ideal. And since Like I say again, there has to be another method that is not documented. </p>\n\n<h2>Conclussions Thus Far</h2>\n\n<p>Testing with the listed APPs suggests that they are not using any of the two methods I just described. Method 'A' seems to be closer but if implemented would not behave how these apps behave. </p>\n\n<p>I used a apple developer ticket to get more info, I'll post any new findings along those means as well. </p>\n\n<h2>Thank You</h2>\n\n<p>Any insight is appreciated, and for your participation thus far.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1332,"score":2,"question_id":5836587,"title":"How do I get all resource paths in my bundle recursively in iOS?","body":"<p>I have an \"unzipped\" folder in my application bundle.

For example, the XML in the .storyboard file has its starting <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> tag's <code>toolsVersion</code> and <code>systemVersion</code> attributes altered by whatever configuration the most recent file manipulator happens to be running. Synchronizing everybody's Xcode versions precisely seems to help with <code>toolsVersion</code>, but <code>systemVersion</code> changes no matter what, depending on the specific Mac and/or OS X version the developer is running.</p>\n\n<p>This is idiotic, but mostly harmless. What worries us, though, is that at other times some other changes are automatically made to the storyboard just by opening them after a <code>git pull</code>. That is to say, Alice makes changes to a storyboard, commits and pushes them to the repository. Bob then pulls Alice's changes and opens up the storyboard to make further changes. The moment he opens the storyboard, the file icon immediately changes to a modified-but-unsaved state, and a <code>git status</code> shows that any number of weird changes have occurred. All this without Bob having changed anything or saved the file himself.</p>\n\n<p>The most common automated change we're seeing is the disappearance or reappearance of the entire <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> tag hierachy near the end of a storyboard file. We haven't figured out what is causing this. We may have several localized versions of a storyboard in various .lproj directories, and when opening them inside Interface Builder, the class hierarchy may spontaneously be removed from some and added into others, or left alone in some. This causes a lot of noise in <code>git diff</code>, but it doesn't actually break any functionality. We will often selectively add the actual changes we made into git's index, commit those, and then just discard the spontaneous, nonsensical <code>&lt;classes&gt;</code> changes. This is to keep commits small and nice, as they should be. Eventually, though, it just becomes too much to bother with since Xcode keeps re-doing the changes, and someone just ragecommits them along with some other stuff... which is fine until someone else's Xcode decides to want to change them back for no apparent reason.

There's scroll views for Leaderboards and Achievements (and others that aren't currently relevant), and in each of them, it's possible to scroll, but it's as though it never gets any touch ended events. When you let go, the content just stays where it was, even if it's outside the view - it doesn't bounce back. When you touch again, it jumps back instantly, and is scrollable again.</p>\n\n<p>The bigger problem caused by this though, is that you can't normally select anything in the scroll views (I guess they're selected with a touch ended event).

Now the problem is with recording of those notes. As I mentioned I have many instruments, I need to record each instrument sound separately. So, I tried to save the midi note numbers into an array for each instrument. The problem now is I have to mix all of those sounds (ideally with out replaying them through a mixer) and create a music file out of them. One tedious way I could think of is to have each instrument recorded separately into a music file when the midi tone is played itself and finally mix all instrument music files by adding up. But the user may delay some instrument tunes etc and then, I am finding it pretty hard to mix. Also, I was unable to find a proper way with which I can mix audio files of various lengths, and delays before them.

I have this issue where I am using a class to store global information that is needed through out the code because it stores the list of food that a user adds to their meal plan. The issue that I have is that one it is a relatively large data structure that I am using. The data structure is a dictionary with keys to five other dictionaries that all have 8 mutable arrays that can be as large as the user wishes due to the fact that can add as much food as their heart desires.</p>\n\n<p>I have set the structure like so</p>\n\n<pre><code>mealInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]\n[mealInfo setObject:[NSMutableDictionary dictionary] forKey:\"foo\"];\n[[mealInfo objectForKey:\"such\"] setObject: [NSMutableArray array] forKey:\"bar\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is repeated for the complete data structure. This did seem to solve some of my possible memory leaks when I analyzed in xcode. The issue is further then that cause I have an idea what the issue is just not the solution. I have objects created, which create this structure in the local scope of the .m file I am in. I go save this structure in the class where mealInfo is created, not the local scope, with a static object of that class. (<em>I am not using too much code because it is one in a lot of locations and two is way too many lines</em>)</p>\n\n<p>After I save to the static variable of the class I release the local scope, I can not release the mealInfo because when I have done that in the past it actually causes the object to disappear and nil in the class that it was initialized in making it inaccessible to other classes trying to access this information. </p>\n\n<p>One solution I thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getters and setters, but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times. This I was trying to avoid. I will do that if that is the only solution, but would like to get this method to work first. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is not too confusing. I also hope someone might have a solution to this memory leak.

I have tried to find a way to change the iPhone Simulator's User-Agent or allow the User-Agent in IIS 7 but can not seem to figure it out. The User-Agent the iPhone Simulator 6 is presenting is (iPhone Simulator; ios 6.0; Scale/2.00). </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to either allow this User-Agent on IIS 7 or change the User-Agent in the iPhone simulator? </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else seen this issue?\nThanks in advance,\nEd</p>\n\n<p>Update----</p>\n\n<p>Hi Everyone\nOk so I figured out how to change the User-Agent and Content-Type using the NSMutableURLRequest.
