The code does not work, but is my rough push to see what's going to happen.</p>\n\n<pre><code>(defn mock-move [sym]\n    (for [move (filter (and #(not= \"O\" %) #(not= \"X\" %)) (vals board))]\n        (loop [move move\n               board board\n               ranked-moves {}\n               sym sym]\n            (let [board (assoc board move sym)]\n                (if (human-wins board)\n                    (recur (next-move move) (assoc board move (.toString move)) (assoc-in ranked-moves [move] 1) sym)\n                    (if (game-tied board)\n                        (recur (next-move move) (assoc board move (.toString move)) (assoc-in ranked-moves [move] 0) sym)\n                        (recur (next-move move) board ranked-moves (switch-symbol sym))))))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The general steps I wrote out are:</p>\n\n<p><em>It is the computer's turn (O). It wants to find the best move. It's playing against a human player (X).</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Iterate through empty spots on the board.</li>\n<li>For each empty spot,\n<ul>\n<li>Simulate selecting the spot by placing an O there.</li>\n<li>Now check to see if O has won the game.\n<ul>\n<li>If it has won the game, score it a 1, and add a key-value map where the key is the spot and the value is 1.</li>\n<li>Remove O from that spot (we're just simulating things).</li>\n<li>Return to the iteration in step 1. Start at the NEXT open spot (the one after the one we just used) and do NOT switch the symbol (we're still on O's turn).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If O did not win, check to see if the game has ended in a tie.\n<ul>\n<li>If it's a tie, score it a 0, and add a key-value map where the key is the spot and the value is 0.</li>\n<li>Remove O from that spot (we're just simulating things).</li>\n<li>Return to the iteration in step 1. Start at the NEXT open spot (the one after the one we just used) and do NOT switch the symbol (we're still on O's turn).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If neither are true (the game has not been won and the game is not tied), then return to the iteration in step 1 and hand them the CURRENT board (with our simulation move made) and switch the symbol to X (it is now time to simulate an X move).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Does that make sense?  Am I going about this in the right way?  What functions (not the actual code, but the purpose of the functions) does the Minimax need?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that my goal is to score each available spot.  If I have a board with 5 open spots, each should receive a score of -1, 0, or 1, and the computer should pick the highest.  But I can't seem to figure out how to get to this point and after a few days of trying I feel like my brain's fried.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","algorithm","matlab","correlation"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":40,"score":-2,"question_id":13277414,"title":"Different Cross-Correlation Results in MATLAB and C++ but Same Algorithm","body":"<p>I have implemented a cross-correlation algorithm both in MATLAB and C++.

So, for instance,\nCalculus I currently has 4 sections available. This means that, depending on the amount of sections, and whether or not the course has a lab, this drastically affects the scheduling process.</p></li>\n<li><p>Courses at our university are represented using a combination of subject abbreviation and course code. In the case of Calculus I: MATH 1110.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CRN is a code unique to a section.</p></li>\n<li><p>The university I study at is not mixed, meaning males and females study in (almost) separate campuses. What I mean by almost is that the campus is divided into two.</p></li>\n<li><p>The datetimes and timeranges dicts are meant to decreases calls to datetime.datetime.strptime(), which was a real bottleneck.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My first attempt consisted of the algorithm looping continuously until 30 schedules were found. Schedules were created by randomly choosing a section from one of the inputted courses, and then trying to place sections from the remaining courses to try to construct a valid schedule. If not all of the courses fit into the schedule i.e. there were conflicts, the schedule was scrapped and the loop continued.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the above solution is flawed. The algorithm took too long to run, and relied too much on randomness.</p>\n\n<p>The second algorithm does the exact opposite of the old one. First, it generates a collection of all possible schedule combinations using itertools.product(). It then iterates through the schedules, crossing off any that are invalid. To ensure assorted sections, the schedule combinations are shuffled (random.shuffle()) before being validated. Again, there is a bit of randomness involved.</p>\n\n<p>After a bit of optimization, I was able to get the scheduler to run in under 1 second for an average schedule consisting of 5 courses. That's great, but the problem begins once you start adding more courses.</p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea, when I provide a certain set of inputs, the amount of combinations possible is so large that itertools.product() <em>does not terminate</em> in a reasonable amount of time, and eats up 1GB of RAM in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if I'm going to make this a service, I'm going to need a faster and more efficient algorithm. Two that have popped up online and in IRC: dynamic programming and genetic algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Dynamic programming cannot be applied to this problem because, if I understand the concept correctly, it involves breaking up the problem into smaller pieces, solving these pieces individually, and then bringing the solutions of these pieces together to form a complete solution. As far as I can see, this does not apply here.</p>\n\n<p>As for genetic algorithms, I do not understand them much, and cannot even begin to fathom how to apply one in such a situation. I also understand that a GA would be more efficient for an extremely large problem space, and this is not <em>that</em> large.</p>\n\n<p>What alternatives do I have? Is there a relatively understandable approach I can take to solve this problem? Or should I just stick to what I have and hope that not many people decide to take 8 courses next semester?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a great writer, so I'm sorry for any ambiguities in the question.

I do little bit about compression theories and so am aware that this scheme that I have come up with could very well never achieve compression at all.</p>\n\n<p>Currently it works only for a string with no consecutive repeating letters/digits/symbols. Once properly established I hope to extrapolate it to binary data etc. But first the algorithm:</p>\n\n<p>Assuming there are only 4 letters: a,b,c,d; we create a matrix/array corresponding to the letters. Whenever a letter is encountered, the corresponding index is incremented so that the index of the last letter encountered is always largest. We incremement an index by 2 if it was originally zero. If it was not originally zero then we increment it by 2+(the second largest element in the matrix). An example to clarify:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array = [a,b,c,d]\nInitial state = [0,0,0,0]\nLetter = a\nNew state = [2,0,0,0]\nLetter = b\nNew state = [2,4,0,0]\n.\n.c\n.d\n.\nNew state = [2,4,6,8]\nLetter = a\nNew state = [12,4,6,8] \n//Explanation for the above state: 12 because Largest - Second Largest - 2 = Old value\nLetter = d\nNew state = [12,4,6,22]\nand so on...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Decompression is just this logic in reverse.</p>\n\n<p>A rudimentary implementation of compression (in python):</p>\n\n<p>(This function is very rudimentary so not the best kind of code...I know.

Now comes the tricky part:</p>\n\n<p>I can't really call this compression at all because <strong>each</strong> number in the matrix generated from the function are of the order of 10**200 for a string of length 50000. So storing the matrix actually takes more space than storing the original string. I know...totally useless. But I had hoped prior to doing all this that I can use the mathematical properties of a matrix to effectively represent it in some kind of mathematical shorthand. I have tried many possibilities and failed. Some things that I tried:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rank of the matrix. Failed because not unique.</p></li>\n<li><p>Denote using the mod function.

But don't really result in any compression. Same for the code. Minor optimizations later...first I want to improve the main algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is very likely that this product of a mediocre and idle mind like myself could never be able to achieve compression after all. In which case, I would then like your help and ideas on what this could probably be useful in. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Check coded parts which depict a compression algorithm. The compressed result is longer than the original string. Can this be fixed? If yes, how?</strong></p>\n\n<p>PS: I have the entire code on my PC.

You also have a start vertex and a collection of goal vertices.\n ou’re interested In finding the shortest path from the start vertex to a goal vertex, with one catch. (If there were no catch you could use Dijkstra’s or the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm, which you should review because they will be useful in solving this problem.)</p>\n\n<p>The catch is that there’s an adversary watching your progress through this graph. And when you’re at a vertex, the adversary can decide to temporarily block one of the exiting edges from your vertex. When you move along an unblocked edge, the adversary then removes the previous block and sets up a new block on one of the edges from your new vertex.</p>\n\n<p>Give an algorithm that takes such a graph and determines if you can make it to a goal or not, and if so, it tells you how long it will take you to get there (assuming the adversary makes it take as long as he can.)

Let p(v,t) denote such path value, Let d(t,t)=0, and d(v,t)=maximum of distances of shortest path from v to t in G0, we set p(t,t)=0 and p(v,t)=infinity for all vertices in {V-t}. As the regular Dijkstra’s algorithm, this algorithm runs at most V-1 iterations and splits V into two subsets S and T={V-S} such that p(v,t)=d(v,t) for all v in T. We then put item in T iteratively by removing the vertex u with the smallest value of p(u,t) from S and adding it to T. We store the values of p(v,t) in a minimum priority queue. Once we remove the minimum-key vertex u form S, we update p(v) for all vertexes in S that are connected to u by one edge.

The train must arrive facing the same direction it left and the train can never reverse on the tracks.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, the problem can be modeled as an undirected(?) graph where we must find the shortest cycle from a certain vertex, or detect that no such cycle exists. However, the interesting part is that for a vertex, v, the vertices adjacent to v are dependent on the path taken to v, so in a sense the graph could be considered directed, though this direction is path-dependent.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to model each node as 3 separate vertices, A, B and C, where A &lt;-> B and A &lt;-> C, and then use a breadth-first search to build a search tree until we find the original vertex, but this is complicated by the caveat above, namely that the adjacencies for a given vertex depend on the previous vertex we visited. This means that in our BFS tree, nodes can have multiple parents.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously a simple BFS search won't be sufficient to solve this problem. I know there are algorithms that exist to detect cycles in a graph. One approach might be to detect all the cycles, then for each cycle, detect whether the path is valid. (i.e., does not reverse direction) </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else have any insights on approaches to solving this problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nI followed the approach suggested by @Karussell in the comments. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/astahlman/spotify-railway-problem#spotify-railway-problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is my solution on github.</a> </p>\n\n<p>The trick was to model the situation using an edge-based graph, not a traditional vertex-based graph. The input file supplied in the contest is conveniently specified in terms of edges already, so this file can be easily used to build an edge-based graph.</p>\n\n<p>The program uses two important classes: Road and Solver. A Road has two integer fields, j1 and j2. j1 represents the source junction and j2 represents the target junction. Each road is one-way, meaning that you can only travel from j1 to j2. Each Road also includes a LinkedList of adjacent Roads and a parent Road. The Road class also includes static methods to convert between the Strings used in the input file and integer indexes representing the A, B, and C points at each junction.</p>\n\n<p>For each entry in the input file, we add two Roads to a HashMap, one Road for each direction between the two junctions. We now have a list of all of the Roads that run between junctions. We just need to connect the roads together at the junctions through the A, B and C switches. If a Road ends at Junction.A, we look up the roads that begin at Junction.B and Junction.C and add these roads as adjacencies. The buildGraph() function returns the Road whose target junction (j2) is \"1A\" == index 0.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, our graph is constructed. To find the shortest path I simply used a BFS to traverse the graph. We leave the root unmarked and begin by queueing the root's adjacencies. If we find a road whose target junction is \"1A\" (index 0) then we have found the shortest cycle through the starting point. Once we reconstruct the path using each Road's parent property, it's a trivial matter to set the switches appropriately as required in the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Karussell for suggesting this approach. If you want to put your comment in answer form with a short explanation, I will accept it. Thanks to @Origin, as well.

My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values: <code>True</code> for a white pixel, and <code>False</code> for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be \"pixel perfect\". By that I simply mean that if there is a white pixel somewhere on a wall it may create an unintended path.</p>\n\n<p>Another method (which came to me after a bit of thought) is to convert the image to an SVG file - which is a list of paths drawn on a canvas. This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where <code>True</code> indicates a path or wall, <code>False</code> indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Also an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not \"perfectly\" straight. This results in the paths being cubic bezier curves. With a list (array) of boolean values indexed by integers, the curves would not transfer easily, and all the points that line on the curve would have to be calculated, but won't exactly match to list indices.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that while one of these methods may work (though probably not) that they are woefully inefficient given such a large image, and that there exists a better way.

A rational case is made that these are used as they have been shown to be the most performant, stable, multipurpose sorting algorithms in use. It seems to me that all objects that we could conceive of sorting (realistically) on a computer are countably enumerable. Numbers, characters, strings, even functions (at least results upon application) are amenable to a non-comparison sorting method (As an aside, if you have doubts about string sorting, examine <a href=\"http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads//HTML/americanFlagSort.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Flag Sort</a> for a review of lexicographical ordering of strings with Radix sort).</p>\n\n<p>For situations like sorting unlabeled weights, we must use a comparison sort given the absence of a label. However, I have difficulty coming up with a pragmatic case where this property holds (that property being the absence of a cognizable, orderable label) that requires sorting on a machine, ranging from natural orderings to lexicographical ordering.</p>\n\n<p>A candidate counterexample is Radix sort. Radix sort is not comparison based. In general it will behave faster than O(n*log(n)), beating the theoretical comparison sort limit of n * log(n) by a wide margin in many cases with a complexity of O(K*n) -- K being the number of bits that are required to represent a particular item. </p>\n\n<p>Concerns like cache invalidation and memory overhead seem to be an excursion from pragmatism given the properties of contemporary hardware. Memory overhead in relation to quicksort (particular today) is not critical, since you can choose the number of buckets to use and the required memory will certainly be less than say, heap or mergesort's requirements.</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't think the position that Radix sort is \"faster\" (for any practical metric) than Quicksort is widely accepted amongst Engineers or Computer scientists, but it's not an implausible position.

Anything higher than 180 is impossible. This doesn't mean anything below 180 IS possible. 179 for example, is impossible as well, because the next best score is triple20+triple20+triple19 = 167</p>\n\n<p>4) Normally, you start at 501, and you throw 3 darts, untill you have exactly 0 points left.</p>\n\n<p>5) Now, in Double Out, it is required that the last dart hits a Double</p>\n\n<p>E.g. if you have 180 points left, you cannot finish, because your last dart has to be a double. So the maximum (with ignoring the bulls eye) = triple20 + triple20 + double20 = 160\nAnd if your score is 16, you can simply finish using 1 dart by hitting the double 8.\nAnother example, if your score is 61, you can hit triple17 + double5 (= 51 + 10)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, below is what I have so far.

It has several properties that most language specific implementations might leave out. It distinguishes between 3 different 'colors' of vertices.

Given that P out of R outcomes will be from\n  the fortune-teller set, it is not difficult to see that there are NCP\n  = (N/P!)/(N-P)! possible P-subsets from the fortune-teller set that can occur in the winning ticket. If we were to pick all P-subsets from\n  the fortune-teller set W times and fill in the remaining R-P slots\n  arbitrarily, the set of tickets obtained will have at least W\n  occurrences of each P-subset and guarantee us W wins. However, such a\n  set need not be a minimal one and in most cases is not.  </p>\n  \n  <p>We know from the fortune-teller’s promise that one of the P-subsets\n  will occur in the winning ticket. It is possible for two P-subsets to\n  differ by less than J numbers. When such a situation arises, the\n  subsets are said to overlap or cover one another with respect to the\n  shared J numbers and only one of the P-subsets must be in a purchased\n  ticket. This phenomenon is best illustrated using an example. Suppose\n  we are playing the PICK-4 Lotto and require one 2/4 win. Hence R=4,\n  J=2 and W=1. Furthermore let’s assume that the fortune-teller predicts\n  3 numbers from a set of 5 numbers ( i.e. P=3 and N=5 ). If all\n  P-subsets were taken from the fortune-teller set and arbitrarily\n  filled to complete the tickets, we would have a set of ten tickets\n  that guarantees one 2/4 win ( See Figure 1 ). However, it is also\n  possible to exclude some tickets from this set because of several\n  two-number overlaps. For instance the subset {3, 4, 5} is different\n  than {1, 3, 5} by only one number and it will be wasteful to use both\n  of these in purchased tickets. We might think that not including {3,\n  4, 5} will permit the possibility of losing, but that is not the case\n  since if {3, 4, 5}occurs we will have ‘3’ and ‘5’ in {1, 3, 5}that we\n  bought to claim the prize! Similarly there can be many more redundant\n  P-subsets. An optimal solution is shown in Figure 2. Our lottery\n  problem is that of finding the smallest set of P-subsets from the\n  fortune-teller set that guarantees the specified number of wins by\n  keeping the number of overlaps to a minimum. This set of P-subsets\n  defines the winning set regardless of what numbers are used to\n  complete the R slots on the ticket.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question are followiong</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As author metioned \"If all P-subsets were taken from the fortune-teller set and arbitrarily filled to complete the tickets, we would have a set of ten tickets\" As in article table is missing can any one help me here what are the 10 tickets?</p></li>\n<li><p>In above example if 1 and 3 occurs and if we didn't select {1, 3, 5} how can we win here?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can anyone come up with fig 2 which is missing in article? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>thank!</p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","graph"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":1,"question_id":13160494,"title":"Finding the critical intersections of a road network","body":"<p>I am trying to solve <a href=\"http://opc.iarcs.org.in/index.php/problems/CRITINTS\" rel=\"nofollow\">this problem</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A intersection I is critical if there are two other intersections J and K such that any route from J to K must necessarily pass through I.

A street (\"123\") always uses exactly 3 tiles, not more and not less. A set of the same kind (\"111\") consists of exactly 3 tiles, too.

After posting it he reviewed the formulas originated from Math Overflow and found a flaw in it (point to Stackoverflow :).<br>\n<em>noahlavine</em> developed an algorithm and presented it in pseudocode.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>A new solution</strong><br>\nAfter reading all the answers, and doing some experiments, I found that for a range of integer from 1 to 10<sup>n</sup>-1:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For digits 1 to 9, n*10<sup>(n-1)</sup> pieces are needed </li>\n<li>For digit 0, if not using leading zeros, n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - ((10<sup>n</sup>-1) / 9) are needed</li>\n<li>For digit 0, if using leading zeros,  n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - n are needed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first formula was found by <em>strainer</em> (and probably by others), and I found the other two by trial and error (but they may be included in other answers).</p>\n\n<p>For example, if n = 6, range is 1 to 999,999:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For digits 1 to 9 we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> = 600,000 of each one</li>\n<li>For digit 0, without leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – (10<sup>6</sup>-1)/9 = 600,000 - 111,111 = 488,889</li>\n<li>For digit 0, with leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – 6 = 599,994</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These numbers can be checked using <em>High-Performance Mark</em> results. </p>\n\n<p>Using these formulas, I improved the original algorithm. It still loops from the first to the last number in the range of integers, but, if it finds a number which is a power of ten, it uses the formulas to add to the digits count the quantity for a full range of 1 to 9 or 1 to 99 or 1 to 999 etc. Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:</p>\n\n<pre>integer First,Last //First and last number in the range\ninteger Number     //Current number in the loop\ninteger Power      //Power is the n in 10^n in the formulas\ninteger Nines      //Nines is the resut of 10^n - 1, 10^5 - 1 = 99999\ninteger Prefix     //First digits in a number. For 14,200, prefix is 142\narray 0..9  Digits //Will hold the count for all the digits\n\nFOR Number = First TO Last\n  CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Number,1  //Tally the count of each digit \n                                              //in the number, increment by 1\n  //Start of optimization. Comments are for Number = 1,000 and Last = 8,000.\n  Power = Zeros at the end of number //For 1,000, Power = 3\n  IF Power > 0                       //The number ends in 0 00 000 etc \n    Nines = 10^Power-1                 //Nines = 10^3 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n    IF Number+Nines &lt;= Last            //If 1,000+999 &lt; 8,000, add a full set\n      Digits[0-9] += Power*10^(Power-1)  //Add 3*10^(3-1) = 300 to digits 0 to 9\n      Digits[0]   -= -Power              //Adjust digit 0 (leading zeros formula)\n      Prefix = First digits of Number    //For 1000, prefix is 1\n      CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Prefix,Nines //Tally the count of each \n                                                     //digit in prefix,\n                                                     //increment by 999\n      Number += Nines                    //Increment the loop counter 999 cycles\n    ENDIF\n  ENDIF \n  //End of optimization\nENDFOR  \n\nSUBROUTINE TallyDigitsForOneNumber PARAMS Number,Count\n  REPEAT\n    Digits [ Number % 10 ] += Count\n    Number = Number / 10\n  UNTIL Number = 0\n</pre>\n\n<p>For example, for range 786 to 3,021, the counter will be incremented:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By 1 from 786 to 790 (5 cycles)</li>\n<li>By 9 from 790 to 799 (1 cycle)</li>\n<li>By 1 from 799 to 800</li>\n<li>By 99 from 800 to 899</li>\n<li>By 1 from 899 to 900</li>\n<li>By 99 from 900 to 999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 999 to 1000</li>\n<li>By 999 from 1000 to 1999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 1999 to 2000</li>\n<li>By 999 from 2000 to 2999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 2999 to 3000</li>\n<li>By 1 from 3000 to 3010 (10 cycles)</li>\n<li>By 9 from 3010 to 3019 (1 cycle)</li>\n<li>By 1 from 3019 to 3021 (2 cycles)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total: 28 cycles\nWithout optimization: 2,235 cycles</p>\n\n<p>Note that this algorithm solves the problem without leading zeros. To use it with leading zeros, I used a hack:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If range 700 to 1,000 with leading zeros is needed, use the algorithm for 10,700 to 11,000 and then substract 1,000 - 700 = 300 from the count of digit 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Benchmark and Source code</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I tested the original approach, the same approach using %10 and the new solution for some large ranges, with these results:</p>\n\n<pre>\nOriginal             104.78 seconds\nWith %10              83.66\nWith Powers of Ten     0.07\n</pre>\n\n<p>A screenshot of the benchmark application:<br>\n<img src=\"http://clarion.sca.mx/images/stories/digitsbench.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n\n<p>If you would like to see the full source code or run the benchmark, use these links:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Source code (in <a href=\"http://clarion.sca.mx/What-is-Clarion\">Clarion</a>): <a href=\"http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.txt\">http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.txt</a></li>\n<li>Compilable project and win32 exe: <a href=\"http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.zip\">http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.zip</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Accepted answer</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><em>noahlavine</em> solution may be correct, but l just couldn’t follow the pseudo code, I think there are some details missing or not completely explained.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Aaronaught</em> solution seems to be correct, but the code is just too complex for my taste.  </p>\n\n<p>I accepted <em>strainer</em>’s answer, because his line of thought guided me to develop this new solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","algorithm","transactions","memcached"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13132664,"title":"Implement atomic counter in Memcached without cas","body":"<p>We have a web page want to limit uo to 100 people can access concurrently, so we use a memcached to implement a global counter, e.g.</p>\n\n<p>We are using <code>http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php</code> so there is not <code>cas</code>, current code is something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>$count = $memcache_obj-&gt;get('count');\nif ($count &lt; 100) {\n   $memcache_obj-&gt;set('count', $count+1);\n   echo \"Welcome\";\n} else {\n   echo \"No luck\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see there is race condition in the above code and but if we are not going to replace <code>memcached</code> extension which support <code>cas</code>, it is able to support it using PHP code only?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","algorithm","nlp","computation-theory","cfg"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":2,"question_id":13139821,"title":"Algorithm to generate context free grammar from any regex","body":"<p>Can anyone outline for me an algorithm that can convert any given regex into an equivalent set of CFG rules?</p>\n\n<p>I know how to tackle the elementary stuff such as (a|b)*:</p>\n\n<pre><code>S -&gt; a A\nS -&gt; a B\nS -&gt; b A\nS -&gt; b B\nA -&gt; a A\nA -&gt; a B\nA -&gt; epsilon\nB -&gt; b A\nB -&gt; b B\nB -&gt; epsilon\nS -&gt; epsilon (end of string)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I'm having some problem formalizing it into a proper algorithm especially with more complex expressions that can have many nested operations.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","algorithm"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":108,"score":4,"question_id":13127898,"title":"2 in a row c# program game","body":"<p>here is the <a href=\"http://s1119.beta.photobucket.com/user/arled/media/Untitled-4.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">game board</a> just to give you an idea of how it looks like (this board will be expanded to a 7x6)</p>\n\n<p>what i want to do is detect a winner when 2 colors are in a row similar to the game \"conmect four\" taking into account diagonal combos too.

So when I search for element \"i\", k is log_2(i+1).</p>\n\n<pre><code>index = { \n    [0], -&gt; [0]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [3],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    [4],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    ....}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The size of each data block is determined by the \"super block\" it is clustered into. Where a super block is  made up of data blocks with the same size. So. index 1,2 are in the same super block (super block 1). While 0 (super block 0), and index 3 (superblock 2) are not.</p>\n\n<p>You end up with each superblock having 2^(floor(k/2)) data blocks, and each of those data blocks has size 2^(ceil(k/2)).   </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>\nWhen r = a power of 2 the index skips over what is should be.\nLike when I search for 3 it should be <code>index [2][0]</code>, instead its <code>index[3][0]</code>.\nWhy does this happen? any way to avoid it?

The two integers are lookup keys which are used to retrieve one/more objects and all the objects from the two lookups are paired together into new objects.</p>\n\n<p>This small block of code in a much larger more complex system becomes a major performance bottleneck as the dataset it's operating over scales.  Some of this could likely be mitigated by improving the data structures used to store the objects and the lookups involved but the main issue I feel is still the computation of the Cartesian product itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So some more background on my specific usage of the algorithm to see if there may be any tricks that I can use in response to Marc's comment.  The overall system is a SPARQL query engine which processes SPARQL queries over sets of Graph data, SPARQL is a pattern based language so each query consists of a series of patterns which are matched against the Graph(s).  In the case where two subsequent patterns have no common variables (they are disjoint) it is necessary to compute the Cartesian product of the solutions produced by the two patterns to get the set of possible solutions for the overall query.  There may be any number of patterns and I may have to compute Cartesian products multiple times which can lead to a fairly exponential expansion in possible solutions if the query is composed of a series of disjoint patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow from the existing answers I doubt whether there any tricks that could apply</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I thought I would post an update on what I implemented in order to minimise the need to do Cartesian products and thus optimise the query engine generally.  Note that it's not always possible to completely eliminate the need for products but it's nearly always possible to optimise so the size of the two sets being joined is much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>Since each BGP (Basic Graph Pattern) which is a set of Triple Patterns is executed as a block (in essence) the engine is free to reorder patterns within a BGP for optimal performance.  For example consider the following BGP:</p>\n\n<pre><code>?a :someProperty ?b .\n?c :anotherProperty ?d .\n?b a :Class .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Executed as is the query requires a cartesian product since the results of the first pattern are disjoint from the second pattern so the results of the first two patterns is a cartesian product of their individual results.  This result will contain far more results than we actually need since the third pattern restricts the possible results of the first pattern but we don't apply this restriction till afterwards.  But if we reorder like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>?b a :Class .\n?a :someProperty ?b .\n?c :anotherProperty ?d .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We'll still need a cartesian product to get the final results since the 2nd and 3rd patterns are still disjoint but by reordering we restrict the size of the results of the 2nd pattern meaning the size of our cartesian product will be much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>There are some various other optimisations we make but I'm not going to post them here as it starts to get into fairly detailed discussion of SPARQL engine internals.

Now, unlike the general load balancing problem present in CS theory (which is NP hard) - where the task is to allocate M loads in N servers (M >> N), such that the maximum load in any one server is minimized, the case that I am dealing with is a little more generic. In my case, the load balancing problem is more generic in the sense - it has more constraints in the form that - such and such job can only be assigned to such an such server (lets say for example job M_{i} has some special security requirements and hence can be allocated/executed only on secure server N_{j}.</p>\n\n<p>Now I looked at the Kleinberg/Tardos book and I found a section (11.7) on the more generic load balancing problem (load balancing with constraints) and I found that this problem is an exact match for the situation I am in. The Generic Load Balancing problem has been converted from IP to LP taking advantage of the fact that LP can result in fractional assignment of jobs to machines which has later been rounded off adding an additional O(MN) time to the process. This approximation solution has then been shown to be within a factor of 2 times from the minimum possible. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone point me to some C/Java/Python/MATLAB code where this algorithm has been implemented? As KL book hardly gives any examples or sample pseudo/actual code, it is hard to get the algorithm internalized completely sometimes. Also as for the linear programming part of the problem - what kind of an implementation is suitable for it - Simplex/Interior Point? How much difference will it make when complexity from this LP part is added to the problem (to the fractional re-assignment part)?

If K is even, though, we use two lines of x'es to mark the horizontal and vertical line of symmetry. Moreover, we can't use more than two loops in the whole source.</p>\n\n<p>So I have two ideas. The first is to analyze the coordinates each of the points should fulfill - there should be an equation for each of the points telling us if a given (Kx, Ky) point is x or o. We put it in the alternation of some if and just while-loop through all possible (Kx, Ky) marking some spots as x and others as y. This requires one loop.</p>\n\n<p>The other idea, quite brute-force but not making us analyze all the points, is to have a set of variables we then use for concatenating the strings. Let me explain: we have one while loop checking the \"height\" variable (each turn we decrement it by one) inside which we use a custom method of some repeatString consisting of one while-loop as well (it just multiplies the string by given t times). So we have something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while(height):\nif height==maxHeight OR ==0: print repeatString(\"x\", maxWidth)\nelse if height is an element of markedKy (an array telling us which Ky's to mark as x'es as the whole): print repearString(\"x\", maxWidth)\nelse print \"x\"+(howManySpaces*\" \")+\"x\" [\"xx\" if even] + (howManySpaces*\" \") +\"x\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and so on.

The reason this is not always used is because it requires us to check (n-1)! possible routes, and that number gets huge as 'n' increases- in fact, with just 50 cities, that would be 608281864034267560872252163321295376887552831379210240000000000 routes to check.</p>\n\n<p><em>ASSUME FOR ALL EXAMPLES TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POST THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN ARBITRARY REGION WITH 4 CITIES</em> (even though the algorithm can handle n cities. also we don't care about distances- we want to hit every possible route in brute force).</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple picture demoing what I'm talking about (4 cities is what I'm starting with to check if the process is working properly)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0050300707002.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">picture of map with cities</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the Brute Force algorithm (assume all other called methods work correctly, because they do):</p>\n\n<p>(check below for a bit more explanation)</p>\n\n<p>[code]</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void BruteForceFindBestRoute(Route r) //Must start r having 1 unflagged city to begin with\n    {\n        if(!r.allFlagged() &amp;&amp; r.route.size() != m.cities.size())\n        {\n            /*STEP 1 Begin with last unflagged city*/\n            City pivot = r.lastCityAdded();\n            /*STEP 2: Flag city*/\n            pivot.visited = true;\n            /*STEP 3: Find cities \"NOT IN ROUTE\"*/\n            ArrayList&lt;City&gt; citiesNotInRoute = new ArrayList&lt;City&gt;();\n            for(int i = 0; i&lt;m.cities.size(); i++)\n            {\n                if(!r.isCityInRoute(m.cities.get(i).name))\n                {\n                    citiesNotInRoute.add(m.cities.get(i));\n                }\n            }\n            /*STEP 4: Recursively call BruteForceFindBestRoute() using these cities added to the end of our original route*/\n            for(int i = 0; i&lt;citiesNotInRoute.size(); i++)\n            {\n                Route newRoute = r;\n                newRoute.addToRoute(citiesNotInRoute.get(i));\n                BruteForceFindBestRoute(newRoute);\n            }\n        }\n        /*STEP 5: If the route is full but the last city isn't flagged, then flag it call BruteForceFindBestRoute() again, with the last city flagged*/\n        else if(!r.allFlagged() &amp;&amp; r.route.size() == m.cities.size())\n        {\n            if(r.allFlaggedButLast())\n            {\n                Route x = r;\n                x.flagLastCity();\n                BruteForceFindBestRoute(x);\n            }\n        }\n        /*STEP 6: If all cities are flagged, the route is full.

However, after it gets to the bottom, one would expect the recursion to jump back up to step4, which it does. However, instead of R having city A flagged and city B unflagged and then recursively calling itself on the \"new route\" containing Aflag and B, R now has all 4 cities included, and all 4 are flagged. It fails because it adds city D again to \"newRoute\", recursively calls itself again, and in another method we get an array out of bounds error because there aren't 5 cities in my region, but there incorrectly are 5 cities in route r (A,B,C,D,D). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii191/om3n07/46049b90.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helpful picture of recursive tree structure</a></p>\n\n<p>The problem has something to do with calling recursion in the loop, or route 'r' being referenced within a recursive call.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any idea what I need to do, I would SERIOUSLY appreciate some help.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to anyone who will help me out.

I will state the problem and then what I have tried and perhaps someone can point me in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have a bag of items (unordered, duplicates permitted).  In practice the bag may contain 2-20 items in case this relaxation helps.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to find the minimum length chain (ordered link list in case we have different notions of a chain) which contains all of the items in the bag in any order.</p>\n\n<p>A chain consists of a start token (not present in bag) followed by any number of items followed by an end token (also not in bag).</p>\n\n<p>The chain is formed by piecing together n-tuples (order is important) and as a further relaxation let us say the n value is the same for all tuples.  In practice, I am working with n = 3.  Chains may be \"blended\" as opposed to concatenated if they have overlapping elements.  For example, consider (a,b,c) and (c,d,e).  The may be joined as (a,b,c,d,e).  Likewise, (a,b,c) and (b,c,d) may be joined as (a,b,c,d).  Some tuples may have a start token in the first position and some tokens make have an end token in the last position which of course allows there to be a solution to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem to me that an exact solution to the problem is not tractable in general.  Some sort of optimization algorithm would be necessary in order to get a \"good\" solution to the problem.  \"Good\" solutions I can live with.</p>\n\n<p>What I have started with is a greedy approach where on the first pass you find the tuple which contains the most number of elements in the bag, arbitrarily breaking ties.  Create a data structure which holds the chain we have built so far, and stick the chosen tuple into this data structure.  Split the problem into 2 subproblems, the start token side and the end token side.  Until the first token of the data structure of subproblem 1 is a start token and the last token of subproblem 2 is an end token, grow the chain such that we are trying to find the stop condition as soon as possible (start or end token depending on the subproblem) while also trying to exhaust the contents of the bag as soon as possible.  This may not be good because each subproblem has to communicate with each other as to how many items are left in the bag which need to be included.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone seen this problem anywhere?  Any thoughts as to how to improve (or get to work correctly) this algorithm?  This is a real problem I am tackling which is a smart part of a much larger system and is not a toy problem or a homework problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sorry all I been away from the computer today.

Initially, these numbers are just the\ndegrees of the vertices.</li>\n<li>Initialize an array D such that D[i] contains a list of the\nvertices v that are not already in L for which dv = i.</li>\n<li>Initialize k to 0.</li>\n<li><p>Repeat n times:</p>\n\n<p>1.Scan the array cells D[0], D[1], ... until finding an i for which D[i] is nonempty.</p>\n\n<p>2.Set k to max(k,i)</p>\n\n<p>3.Select a vertex v from D[i].

Buyers can tag their needs with keywords; sellers can do the same for what they are selling. I'm interested in finding algorithm(s) that rank-order sellers in terms of their relevance for a particular buyer on the basis of their two keyword sets. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>buyer_keywords = {\"furry\", \"four legs\", \"likes catnip\", \"has claws\"} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then we have two potential sellers that we need to rank order in terms of their relevance: </p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[1] = {\"furry\", \"four legs\", \"arctic circle\", \"white\"}\nseller_keywords[2] = {\"likes catnip\", \"furry\", \n                      \"hates mice\", \"yarn-lover\", \"whiskers\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we just use the intersection of keywords, we do not get much discrimination: both intersect on 2 keywords. If we divide the intersection count by the size of the set union, seller 2 actually does worse because of the greater number of keywords. This would seem to introduce an automatic penalty for any method not correcting keyword set size (and we definitely don't want to penalize adding keywords). </p>\n\n<p>To put a bit more structure on the problem, suppose we have some truthful measure of intensity of keyword attributes (which have to sum to 1 for each seller), e.g.,: </p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[1] = {\"furry\":.05, \n                      \"four legs\":.05, \n                      \"arctic circle\":.8, \n                      \"white\":.1}\n\nseller_keywords[2] = {\"likes catnip\":.5, \n                      \"furry\":.4, \n                      \"hates mice\":.02, \n                      \"yarn-lover\":.02, \n                      \"whiskers\":.06}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we could sum up the value of hits: so now Seller 1 only gets a score of .1, while Seller 2 gets a score of .9. So far, so good, but now we might get a third seller with a very limited, non-descriptive keyword set:</p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[3] = {\"furry\":1}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This catapults them to the top for any hit on their sole keyword, which isn't good.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my guess (and hope) is that this is a fairly general problem and that there exist different algorithmic solutions with known strengths and limitations. This is probably something covered in CS101, so I think a good answer to this question might just be a link to the relevant references.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","web-services","nlp","graph-theory","semantic"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":555,"score":6,"question_id":571932,"title":"Building or Finding a \"relevant terms\" suggestion feature","body":"<p>Given a few words of input, I want to have a utility that will return a diverse set of relevant terms, phrases, or concepts.
