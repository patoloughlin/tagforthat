The actual mesh is a list of Vertices, HalfEdges and Faces. The new mesh will consist of NewVertices, NewHalfEdges and NewFaces, like this (note: <strong>Number_...</strong> is the number of <strong>...</strong>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>NumberNewVertices: Number_Faces + Number_HalfEdges/2 + Number_Vertices\nNumberNewHalfEdges: 4 * 4 * NumberFaces\nNumberNewfaces: 4 * NumberFaces\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Catmull-Clark:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Find the FacePoint (centroid) of each Face:\n--&gt; Just average the x,y,z values of the vertices, save as a NewVertex. \nFind the EdgePoint of each HalfEdge:\n--&gt; To prevent duplicates (each HalfEdge has a Twin which would result in the same HalfEdge)\n--&gt; Only calculate EdgePoints of the HalfEdge which has the lowest index of the Pair.\nUpdate old Vertices\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ok, now all the new Vertices are calculated (however, their <strong>Outgoing_HalfEdge</strong> is still unknown).

Basically, you have a maximum of 3 darts, en you have to finish with a double.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't know the rule of Darts x01 games with Double Out finishing, it's difficult to understand this question...  Let me try to explain. For simplicity, I keep the Bull's eye out of the equation for now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) You have three darts which you can throw at number 1 through 20</p>\n\n<p>2) A single hit can have a single, double or triple score</p>\n\n<p>E.g. you can hit:\nsingle 20 = 20 points or\ndouble 20 = 40 points or\ntriple 20 = 60 points</p>\n\n<p>3) In one turn, you can score a maximum of 180 points (3x triple 20 = 3*60 = 180). Anything higher than 180 is impossible. This doesn't mean anything below 180 IS possible. 179 for example, is impossible as well, because the next best score is triple20+triple20+triple19 = 167</p>\n\n<p>4) Normally, you start at 501, and you throw 3 darts, untill you have exactly 0 points left.</p>\n\n<p>5) Now, in Double Out, it is required that the last dart hits a Double</p>\n\n<p>E.g. if you have 180 points left, you cannot finish, because your last dart has to be a double. So the maximum (with ignoring the bulls eye) = triple20 + triple20 + double20 = 160\nAnd if your score is 16, you can simply finish using 1 dart by hitting the double 8.\nAnother example, if your score is 61, you can hit triple17 + double5 (= 51 + 10)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, below is what I have so far.

It than compares it to the number of white squares (0's). Whichever is larger, is turned into a percent based on how many squares are in the image. It compares it with the threshold. If the threshold is smaller than the percent... The whole image turned the majority color. </p>\n\n<p>If the threshold is higher... It breaks into four recursive parts and zooms in. It will start with the top right, then top left, bottom left, and bottom right. </p>\n\n<p>My program works with a 4 by 4 square, because it breaks into four parts correctly. However, with the 8 by 8 square... if it needs to be broken into smaller than four parts, everything messes up. </p>\n\n<p>I know why it does this. My algorithm for zooming in the recursive function is wrong. If the square is an 8 by 8... the parameters would be something like</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>0, 8, 0, 8 = looking at the whole square</p>\n  \n  <p>0, 4, 4, 8 = the top right</p>\n  \n  <p>corner using a 4 by 4 0, 2, 6, 8 = looking at the smallest top right</p>\n  \n  <p>square of a 2 by 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I just don't know a mathematical function that would get what I need.

Each node wants to announce its presence to all the other nodes on a regular basis, but since it's a broadcast medium, two nodes transmitting at the same time will create a collision, and neither message will be transmitted correctly.</p>\n\n<p>To further complicate things, when a node receives an invalid message, it doesn't seem practical to reliably determine if this is due to a collision or due to background noise or weak signal. Also, while node visibility will usually be reflexive (A seeing B means B can see A), it will usually be the case that not all nodes can see all other nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Leaving aside external interference for a moment, it seems like a rational approach is to create timeslots, with each node transmitting in each time slot with a small (and ideally similar between nodes) probability. If there are n nodes that transmit with probability p, then no message will be transmitted (1 - p)<sup>n</sup> of the time; exactly one message will be transmitted n * p * (1 - p)<sup>n-1</sup> of the time, and the remainder of the time there will be a collision. The maximum incidence of successful collisions occurs when each of the n nodes transmits 1/nth of the time, and this results in a fairly stable 38% successful transmissions and 24% collisions; this value changes only slightly with increasing numbers of nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, it would seem we could observe the rate of successful transmissions and/or collisions, and adjust our own transmission rate to try and force them towards their expected values. What I'm not sure about is what the best feedback mechanism to achieve this is, such that everyone ends up with similar probabilities. This also doesn't account for external interference, which will cause us to keep decreasing our transmission rate in a doomed effort to avoid collisions that don't exist.</p>\n\n<p>What is the optimal algorithm - either a refinement of the above or a totally different approach - to maximize the proportion of announcement messages each node can receive without collision?</p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","design-patterns","game","tile"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":1,"question_id":13289526,"title":"Tile movement range generate pattern?","body":"<p>I am doing a tile based game.

This means that, depending on the amount of sections, and whether or not the course has a lab, this drastically affects the scheduling process.</p></li>\n<li><p>Courses at our university are represented using a combination of subject abbreviation and course code. In the case of Calculus I: MATH 1110.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CRN is a code unique to a section.</p></li>\n<li><p>The university I study at is not mixed, meaning males and females study in (almost) separate campuses. What I mean by almost is that the campus is divided into two.</p></li>\n<li><p>The datetimes and timeranges dicts are meant to decreases calls to datetime.datetime.strptime(), which was a real bottleneck.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My first attempt consisted of the algorithm looping continuously until 30 schedules were found. Schedules were created by randomly choosing a section from one of the inputted courses, and then trying to place sections from the remaining courses to try to construct a valid schedule. If not all of the courses fit into the schedule i.e. there were conflicts, the schedule was scrapped and the loop continued.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the above solution is flawed. The algorithm took too long to run, and relied too much on randomness.</p>\n\n<p>The second algorithm does the exact opposite of the old one. First, it generates a collection of all possible schedule combinations using itertools.product(). It then iterates through the schedules, crossing off any that are invalid. To ensure assorted sections, the schedule combinations are shuffled (random.shuffle()) before being validated. Again, there is a bit of randomness involved.</p>\n\n<p>After a bit of optimization, I was able to get the scheduler to run in under 1 second for an average schedule consisting of 5 courses. That's great, but the problem begins once you start adding more courses.</p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea, when I provide a certain set of inputs, the amount of combinations possible is so large that itertools.product() <em>does not terminate</em> in a reasonable amount of time, and eats up 1GB of RAM in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if I'm going to make this a service, I'm going to need a faster and more efficient algorithm. Two that have popped up online and in IRC: dynamic programming and genetic algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Dynamic programming cannot be applied to this problem because, if I understand the concept correctly, it involves breaking up the problem into smaller pieces, solving these pieces individually, and then bringing the solutions of these pieces together to form a complete solution. As far as I can see, this does not apply here.</p>\n\n<p>As for genetic algorithms, I do not understand them much, and cannot even begin to fathom how to apply one in such a situation. I also understand that a GA would be more efficient for an extremely large problem space, and this is not <em>that</em> large.</p>\n\n<p>What alternatives do I have? Is there a relatively understandable approach I can take to solve this problem? Or should I just stick to what I have and hope that not many people decide to take 8 courses next semester?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a great writer, so I'm sorry for any ambiguities in the question.

I do little bit about compression theories and so am aware that this scheme that I have come up with could very well never achieve compression at all.</p>\n\n<p>Currently it works only for a string with no consecutive repeating letters/digits/symbols. Once properly established I hope to extrapolate it to binary data etc. But first the algorithm:</p>\n\n<p>Assuming there are only 4 letters: a,b,c,d; we create a matrix/array corresponding to the letters. Whenever a letter is encountered, the corresponding index is incremented so that the index of the last letter encountered is always largest. We incremement an index by 2 if it was originally zero. If it was not originally zero then we increment it by 2+(the second largest element in the matrix). An example to clarify:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array = [a,b,c,d]\nInitial state = [0,0,0,0]\nLetter = a\nNew state = [2,0,0,0]\nLetter = b\nNew state = [2,4,0,0]\n.\n.c\n.d\n.\nNew state = [2,4,6,8]\nLetter = a\nNew state = [12,4,6,8] \n//Explanation for the above state: 12 because Largest - Second Largest - 2 = Old value\nLetter = d\nNew state = [12,4,6,22]\nand so on...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Decompression is just this logic in reverse.</p>\n\n<p>A rudimentary implementation of compression (in python):</p>\n\n<p>(This function is very rudimentary so not the best kind of code...I know. I can optimize it once I get the core algorithm correct.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>def compress(text):\n    matrix = [0]*95     #we are concerned with 95 printable chars for now\n    for i in text:\n        temp = copy.deepcopy(matrix) \n        temp.sort()\n        largest = temp[-1]\n        if matrix[ord(i)-32] == 0:\n            matrix[ord(i)-32] = largest+2\n        else:\n            matrix[ord(i)-32] = largest+matrix[ord(i)-32]+2\n    return matrix\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The returned matrix is then used for decompression. Now comes the tricky part:</p>\n\n<p>I can't really call this compression at all because <strong>each</strong> number in the matrix generated from the function are of the order of 10**200 for a string of length 50000. So storing the matrix actually takes more space than storing the original string. I know...totally useless. But I had hoped prior to doing all this that I can use the mathematical properties of a matrix to effectively represent it in some kind of mathematical shorthand. I have tried many possibilities and failed. Some things that I tried:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rank of the matrix. Failed because not unique.</p></li>\n<li><p>Denote using the mod function. Failed because either the quotient or the remainder</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13220488/can-i-store-an-iterator-in-a-file-which-i-can-read-from-later-will-this-reduce\">Store each integer as a generator using pickle.</a></p></li>\n<li>Store the matrix as a bitmap file but then the integers are too large to be able to store as color codes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let me iterate again that the algorithm could be optimized. e.g. instead of adding 2 we could add 1 and proceed. But don't really result in any compression. Same for the code. Minor optimizations later...first I want to improve the main algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is very likely that this product of a mediocre and idle mind like myself could never be able to achieve compression after all. In which case, I would then like your help and ideas on what this could probably be useful in. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Check coded parts which depict a compression algorithm. The compressed result is longer than the original string. Can this be fixed? If yes, how?</strong></p>\n\n<p>PS: I have the entire code on my PC.

You also have a start vertex and a collection of goal vertices.\n ou’re interested In finding the shortest path from the start vertex to a goal vertex, with one catch. (If there were no catch you could use Dijkstra’s or the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm, which you should review because they will be useful in solving this problem.)</p>\n\n<p>The catch is that there’s an adversary watching your progress through this graph. And when you’re at a vertex, the adversary can decide to temporarily block one of the exiting edges from your vertex. When you move along an unblocked edge, the adversary then removes the previous block and sets up a new block on one of the edges from your new vertex.</p>\n\n<p>Give an algorithm that takes such a graph and determines if you can make it to a goal or not, and if so, it tells you how long it will take you to get there (assuming the adversary makes it take as long as he can.) Your algorithm should run in time polynomial in n and m on a graph of n vertices and m edges.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my thought:</p>\n\n<p>Since the adversary make it take as long as he can, we can view the problem as given a digraph G=(V,A), a blocking system created by our adversary, we want to find an admissible graph G0 such that  it maximize the distance of shortest path from each start vertex v to t by blocking one edge each for every vertex’s neighbors. Let p(v,t) denote such path value, Let d(t,t)=0, and d(v,t)=maximum of distances of shortest path from v to t in G0, we set p(t,t)=0 and p(v,t)=infinity for all vertices in {V-t}. As the regular Dijkstra’s algorithm, this algorithm runs at most V-1 iterations and splits V into two subsets S and T={V-S} such that p(v,t)=d(v,t) for all v in T. We then put item in T iteratively by removing the vertex u with the smallest value of p(u,t) from S and adding it to T. We store the values of p(v,t) in a minimum priority queue. Once we remove the minimum-key vertex u form S, we update p(v) for all vertexes in S that are connected to u by one edge. When update, we first insert a key value k(e)=w(vu)+p(u,t) into our blocked queue Y(v), and we update p(v) as the maximum value of all fake value of Y(v) where the fake value of each Y(v) is the minimum key value k(e) within it(exclude the value we just added). Our algorithm terminates as soon as the size of S is equal to 1  </p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","algorithm","language-agnostic","data-structures","fibonacci-heap"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":21,"up_vote_count":64,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12055,"score":64,"question_id":504823,"title":"Has anyone actually implemented a Fibonacci-Heap efficiently?","body":"<p>Has anyone of you ever implemented a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap\">Fibonacci-Heap</a>?

The train must arrive facing the same direction it left and the train can never reverse on the tracks.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, the problem can be modeled as an undirected(?) graph where we must find the shortest cycle from a certain vertex, or detect that no such cycle exists. However, the interesting part is that for a vertex, v, the vertices adjacent to v are dependent on the path taken to v, so in a sense the graph could be considered directed, though this direction is path-dependent.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to model each node as 3 separate vertices, A, B and C, where A &lt;-> B and A &lt;-> C, and then use a breadth-first search to build a search tree until we find the original vertex, but this is complicated by the caveat above, namely that the adjacencies for a given vertex depend on the previous vertex we visited. This means that in our BFS tree, nodes can have multiple parents.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously a simple BFS search won't be sufficient to solve this problem. I know there are algorithms that exist to detect cycles in a graph. One approach might be to detect all the cycles, then for each cycle, detect whether the path is valid. (i.e., does not reverse direction) </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else have any insights on approaches to solving this problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nI followed the approach suggested by @Karussell in the comments. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/astahlman/spotify-railway-problem#spotify-railway-problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is my solution on github.</a> </p>\n\n<p>The trick was to model the situation using an edge-based graph, not a traditional vertex-based graph. The input file supplied in the contest is conveniently specified in terms of edges already, so this file can be easily used to build an edge-based graph.</p>\n\n<p>The program uses two important classes: Road and Solver. A Road has two integer fields, j1 and j2. j1 represents the source junction and j2 represents the target junction. Each road is one-way, meaning that you can only travel from j1 to j2. Each Road also includes a LinkedList of adjacent Roads and a parent Road. The Road class also includes static methods to convert between the Strings used in the input file and integer indexes representing the A, B, and C points at each junction.</p>\n\n<p>For each entry in the input file, we add two Roads to a HashMap, one Road for each direction between the two junctions. We now have a list of all of the Roads that run between junctions. We just need to connect the roads together at the junctions through the A, B and C switches. If a Road ends at Junction.A, we look up the roads that begin at Junction.B and Junction.C and add these roads as adjacencies. The buildGraph() function returns the Road whose target junction (j2) is \"1A\" == index 0.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, our graph is constructed. To find the shortest path I simply used a BFS to traverse the graph. We leave the root unmarked and begin by queueing the root's adjacencies. If we find a road whose target junction is \"1A\" (index 0) then we have found the shortest cycle through the starting point. Once we reconstruct the path using each Road's parent property, it's a trivial matter to set the switches appropriately as required in the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Karussell for suggesting this approach.

My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values: <code>True</code> for a white pixel, and <code>False</code> for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be \"pixel perfect\". By that I simply mean that if there is a white pixel somewhere on a wall it may create an unintended path.</p>\n\n<p>Another method (which came to me after a bit of thought) is to convert the image to an SVG file - which is a list of paths drawn on a canvas. This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where <code>True</code> indicates a path or wall, <code>False</code> indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Also an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not \"perfectly\" straight. This results in the paths being cubic bezier curves. With a list (array) of boolean values indexed by integers, the curves would not transfer easily, and all the points that line on the curve would have to be calculated, but won't exactly match to list indices.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that while one of these methods may work (though probably not) that they are woefully inefficient given such a large image, and that there exists a better way.

A rational case is made that these are used as they have been shown to be the most performant, stable, multipurpose sorting algorithms in use. It seems to me that all objects that we could conceive of sorting (realistically) on a computer are countably enumerable. Numbers, characters, strings, even functions (at least results upon application) are amenable to a non-comparison sorting method (As an aside, if you have doubts about string sorting, examine <a href=\"http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads//HTML/americanFlagSort.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Flag Sort</a> for a review of lexicographical ordering of strings with Radix sort).</p>\n\n<p>For situations like sorting unlabeled weights, we must use a comparison sort given the absence of a label. However, I have difficulty coming up with a pragmatic case where this property holds (that property being the absence of a cognizable, orderable label) that requires sorting on a machine, ranging from natural orderings to lexicographical ordering.</p>\n\n<p>A candidate counterexample is Radix sort. Radix sort is not comparison based. In general it will behave faster than O(n*log(n)), beating the theoretical comparison sort limit of n * log(n) by a wide margin in many cases with a complexity of O(K*n) -- K being the number of bits that are required to represent a particular item. </p>\n\n<p>Concerns like cache invalidation and memory overhead seem to be an excursion from pragmatism given the properties of contemporary hardware. Memory overhead in relation to quicksort (particular today) is not critical, since you can choose the number of buckets to use and the required memory will certainly be less than say, heap or mergesort's requirements.</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't think the position that Radix sort is \"faster\" (for any practical metric) than Quicksort is widely accepted amongst Engineers or Computer scientists, but it's not an implausible position.

I have added the algorithm tag, because it's mainly the steps that i'm interested in rather than the STATA code. </p>\n\n<p>I have some variables, say, var1 - var20 that can possibly contain a string. I am only interested in some of these strings, let us call them A,B,C,D,E,F, but other strings can occur also (all of these will be denoted X). Also I have a unique identifier ID.

It has several properties that most language specific implementations might leave out. It distinguishes between 3 different 'colors' of vertices.

Given that P out of R outcomes will be from\n  the fortune-teller set, it is not difficult to see that there are NCP\n  = (N/P!)/(N-P)! possible P-subsets from the fortune-teller set that can occur in the winning ticket. If we were to pick all P-subsets from\n  the fortune-teller set W times and fill in the remaining R-P slots\n  arbitrarily, the set of tickets obtained will have at least W\n  occurrences of each P-subset and guarantee us W wins. However, such a\n  set need not be a minimal one and in most cases is not.  </p>\n  \n  <p>We know from the fortune-teller’s promise that one of the P-subsets\n  will occur in the winning ticket. It is possible for two P-subsets to\n  differ by less than J numbers. When such a situation arises, the\n  subsets are said to overlap or cover one another with respect to the\n  shared J numbers and only one of the P-subsets must be in a purchased\n  ticket. This phenomenon is best illustrated using an example. Suppose\n  we are playing the PICK-4 Lotto and require one 2/4 win. Hence R=4,\n  J=2 and W=1. Furthermore let’s assume that the fortune-teller predicts\n  3 numbers from a set of 5 numbers ( i.e. P=3 and N=5 ). If all\n  P-subsets were taken from the fortune-teller set and arbitrarily\n  filled to complete the tickets, we would have a set of ten tickets\n  that guarantees one 2/4 win ( See Figure 1 ). However, it is also\n  possible to exclude some tickets from this set because of several\n  two-number overlaps. For instance the subset {3, 4, 5} is different\n  than {1, 3, 5} by only one number and it will be wasteful to use both\n  of these in purchased tickets. We might think that not including {3,\n  4, 5} will permit the possibility of losing, but that is not the case\n  since if {3, 4, 5}occurs we will have ‘3’ and ‘5’ in {1, 3, 5}that we\n  bought to claim the prize! Similarly there can be many more redundant\n  P-subsets. An optimal solution is shown in Figure 2. Our lottery\n  problem is that of finding the smallest set of P-subsets from the\n  fortune-teller set that guarantees the specified number of wins by\n  keeping the number of overlaps to a minimum. This set of P-subsets\n  defines the winning set regardless of what numbers are used to\n  complete the R slots on the ticket.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question are followiong</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As author metioned \"If all P-subsets were taken from the fortune-teller set and arbitrarily filled to complete the tickets, we would have a set of ten tickets\" As in article table is missing can any one help me here what are the 10 tickets?</p></li>\n<li><p>In above example if 1 and 3 occurs and if we didn't select {1, 3, 5} how can we win here?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can anyone come up with fig 2 which is missing in article? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>thank!</p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","graph"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":1,"question_id":13160494,"title":"Finding the critical intersections of a road network","body":"<p>I am trying to solve <a href=\"http://opc.iarcs.org.in/index.php/problems/CRITINTS\" rel=\"nofollow\">this problem</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A intersection I is critical if there are two other intersections J and K such that any route from J to K must necessarily pass through I.

A street (\"123\") always uses exactly 3 tiles, not more and not less. A set of the same kind (\"111\") consists of exactly 3 tiles, too.

After posting it he reviewed the formulas originated from Math Overflow and found a flaw in it (point to Stackoverflow :).<br>\n<em>noahlavine</em> developed an algorithm and presented it in pseudocode.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>A new solution</strong><br>\nAfter reading all the answers, and doing some experiments, I found that for a range of integer from 1 to 10<sup>n</sup>-1:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For digits 1 to 9, n*10<sup>(n-1)</sup> pieces are needed </li>\n<li>For digit 0, if not using leading zeros, n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - ((10<sup>n</sup>-1) / 9) are needed</li>\n<li>For digit 0, if using leading zeros,  n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - n are needed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first formula was found by <em>strainer</em> (and probably by others), and I found the other two by trial and error (but they may be included in other answers).</p>\n\n<p>For example, if n = 6, range is 1 to 999,999:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For digits 1 to 9 we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> = 600,000 of each one</li>\n<li>For digit 0, without leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – (10<sup>6</sup>-1)/9 = 600,000 - 111,111 = 488,889</li>\n<li>For digit 0, with leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – 6 = 599,994</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These numbers can be checked using <em>High-Performance Mark</em> results. </p>\n\n<p>Using these formulas, I improved the original algorithm. It still loops from the first to the last number in the range of integers, but, if it finds a number which is a power of ten, it uses the formulas to add to the digits count the quantity for a full range of 1 to 9 or 1 to 99 or 1 to 999 etc. Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:</p>\n\n<pre>integer First,Last //First and last number in the range\ninteger Number     //Current number in the loop\ninteger Power      //Power is the n in 10^n in the formulas\ninteger Nines      //Nines is the resut of 10^n - 1, 10^5 - 1 = 99999\ninteger Prefix     //First digits in a number. For 14,200, prefix is 142\narray 0..9  Digits //Will hold the count for all the digits\n\nFOR Number = First TO Last\n  CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Number,1  //Tally the count of each digit \n                                              //in the number, increment by 1\n  //Start of optimization. Comments are for Number = 1,000 and Last = 8,000.\n  Power = Zeros at the end of number //For 1,000, Power = 3\n  IF Power > 0                       //The number ends in 0 00 000 etc \n    Nines = 10^Power-1                 //Nines = 10^3 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n    IF Number+Nines &lt;= Last            //If 1,000+999 &lt; 8,000, add a full set\n      Digits[0-9] += Power*10^(Power-1)  //Add 3*10^(3-1) = 300 to digits 0 to 9\n      Digits[0]   -= -Power              //Adjust digit 0 (leading zeros formula)\n      Prefix = First digits of Number    //For 1000, prefix is 1\n      CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Prefix,Nines //Tally the count of each \n                                                     //digit in prefix,\n                                                     //increment by 999\n      Number += Nines                    //Increment the loop counter 999 cycles\n    ENDIF\n  ENDIF \n  //End of optimization\nENDFOR  \n\nSUBROUTINE TallyDigitsForOneNumber PARAMS Number,Count\n  REPEAT\n    Digits [ Number % 10 ] += Count\n    Number = Number / 10\n  UNTIL Number = 0\n</pre>\n\n<p>For example, for range 786 to 3,021, the counter will be incremented:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By 1 from 786 to 790 (5 cycles)</li>\n<li>By 9 from 790 to 799 (1 cycle)</li>\n<li>By 1 from 799 to 800</li>\n<li>By 99 from 800 to 899</li>\n<li>By 1 from 899 to 900</li>\n<li>By 99 from 900 to 999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 999 to 1000</li>\n<li>By 999 from 1000 to 1999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 1999 to 2000</li>\n<li>By 999 from 2000 to 2999</li>\n<li>By 1 from 2999 to 3000</li>\n<li>By 1 from 3000 to 3010 (10 cycles)</li>\n<li>By 9 from 3010 to 3019 (1 cycle)</li>\n<li>By 1 from 3019 to 3021 (2 cycles)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total: 28 cycles\nWithout optimization: 2,235 cycles</p>\n\n<p>Note that this algorithm solves the problem without leading zeros. To use it with leading zeros, I used a hack:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If range 700 to 1,000 with leading zeros is needed, use the algorithm for 10,700 to 11,000 and then substract 1,000 - 700 = 300 from the count of digit 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Benchmark and Source code</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I tested the original approach, the same approach using %10 and the new solution for some large ranges, with these results:</p>\n\n<pre>\nOriginal             104.78 seconds\nWith %10              83.66\nWith Powers of Ten     0.07\n</pre>\n\n<p>A screenshot of the benchmark application:<br>\n<img src=\"http://clarion.sca.mx/images/stories/digitsbench.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n\n<p>If you would like to see the full source code or run the benchmark, use these links:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Source code (in <a href=\"http://clarion.sca.mx/What-is-Clarion\">Clarion</a>): <a href=\"http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.txt\">http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.txt</a></li>\n<li>Compilable project and win32 exe: <a href=\"http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.zip\">http://sca.mx/ftp/countdigits.zip</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Accepted answer</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><em>noahlavine</em> solution may be correct, but l just couldn’t follow the pseudo code, I think there are some details missing or not completely explained.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Aaronaught</em> solution seems to be correct, but the code is just too complex for my taste.  </p>\n\n<p>I accepted <em>strainer</em>’s answer, because his line of thought guided me to develop this new solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","algorithm","transactions","memcached"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13132664,"title":"Implement atomic counter in Memcached without cas","body":"<p>We have a web page want to limit uo to 100 people can access concurrently, so we use a memcached to implement a global counter, e.g.</p>\n\n<p>We are using <code>http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php</code> so there is not <code>cas</code>, current code is something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>$count = $memcache_obj-&gt;get('count');\nif ($count &lt; 100) {\n   $memcache_obj-&gt;set('count', $count+1);\n   echo \"Welcome\";\n} else {\n   echo \"No luck\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see there is race condition in the above code and but if we are not going to replace <code>memcached</code> extension which support <code>cas</code>, it is able to support it using PHP code only?</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","algorithm","nlp","computation-theory","cfg"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":89,"score":2,"question_id":13139821,"title":"Algorithm to generate context free grammar from any regex","body":"<p>Can anyone outline for me an algorithm that can convert any given regex into an equivalent set of CFG rules?</p>\n\n<p>I know how to tackle the elementary stuff such as (a|b)*:</p>\n\n<pre><code>S -&gt; a A\nS -&gt; a B\nS -&gt; b A\nS -&gt; b B\nA -&gt; a A\nA -&gt; a B\nA -&gt; epsilon\nB -&gt; b A\nB -&gt; b B\nB -&gt; epsilon\nS -&gt; epsilon (end of string)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I'm having some problem formalizing it into a proper algorithm especially with more complex expressions that can have many nested operations.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","algorithm"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":108,"score":4,"question_id":13127898,"title":"2 in a row c# program game","body":"<p>here is the <a href=\"http://s1119.beta.photobucket.com/user/arled/media/Untitled-4.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">game board</a> just to give you an idea of how it looks like (this board will be expanded to a 7x6)</p>\n\n<p>what i want to do is detect a winner when 2 colors are in a row similar to the game \"conmect four\" taking into account diagonal combos too.

So when I search for element \"i\", k is log_2(i+1).</p>\n\n<pre><code>index = { \n    [0], -&gt; [0]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [2],  -&gt; [0,1]\n    [3],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    [4],  -&gt; [0,1,2,3]\n    ....}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The size of each data block is determined by the \"super block\" it is clustered into. Where a super block is  made up of data blocks with the same size. So. index 1,2 are in the same super block (super block 1). While 0 (super block 0), and index 3 (superblock 2) are not.</p>\n\n<p>You end up with each superblock having 2^(floor(k/2)) data blocks, and each of those data blocks has size 2^(ceil(k/2)).   </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>\nWhen r = a power of 2 the index skips over what is should be.\nLike when I search for 3 it should be <code>index [2][0]</code>, instead its <code>index[3][0]</code>.\nWhy does this happen? any way to avoid it?

The two integers are lookup keys which are used to retrieve one/more objects and all the objects from the two lookups are paired together into new objects.</p>\n\n<p>This small block of code in a much larger more complex system becomes a major performance bottleneck as the dataset it's operating over scales.  Some of this could likely be mitigated by improving the data structures used to store the objects and the lookups involved but the main issue I feel is still the computation of the Cartesian product itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So some more background on my specific usage of the algorithm to see if there may be any tricks that I can use in response to Marc's comment.  The overall system is a SPARQL query engine which processes SPARQL queries over sets of Graph data, SPARQL is a pattern based language so each query consists of a series of patterns which are matched against the Graph(s).  In the case where two subsequent patterns have no common variables (they are disjoint) it is necessary to compute the Cartesian product of the solutions produced by the two patterns to get the set of possible solutions for the overall query.  There may be any number of patterns and I may have to compute Cartesian products multiple times which can lead to a fairly exponential expansion in possible solutions if the query is composed of a series of disjoint patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow from the existing answers I doubt whether there any tricks that could apply</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I thought I would post an update on what I implemented in order to minimise the need to do Cartesian products and thus optimise the query engine generally.  Note that it's not always possible to completely eliminate the need for products but it's nearly always possible to optimise so the size of the two sets being joined is much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>Since each BGP (Basic Graph Pattern) which is a set of Triple Patterns is executed as a block (in essence) the engine is free to reorder patterns within a BGP for optimal performance.  For example consider the following BGP:</p>\n\n<pre><code>?a :someProperty ?b .\n?c :anotherProperty ?d .\n?b a :Class .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Executed as is the query requires a cartesian product since the results of the first pattern are disjoint from the second pattern so the results of the first two patterns is a cartesian product of their individual results.  This result will contain far more results than we actually need since the third pattern restricts the possible results of the first pattern but we don't apply this restriction till afterwards.  But if we reorder like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>?b a :Class .\n?a :someProperty ?b .\n?c :anotherProperty ?d .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We'll still need a cartesian product to get the final results since the 2nd and 3rd patterns are still disjoint but by reordering we restrict the size of the results of the 2nd pattern meaning the size of our cartesian product will be much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>There are some various other optimisations we make but I'm not going to post them here as it starts to get into fairly detailed discussion of SPARQL engine internals.

Now, unlike the general load balancing problem present in CS theory (which is NP hard) - where the task is to allocate M loads in N servers (M >> N), such that the maximum load in any one server is minimized, the case that I am dealing with is a little more generic. In my case, the load balancing problem is more generic in the sense - it has more constraints in the form that - such and such job can only be assigned to such an such server (lets say for example job M_{i} has some special security requirements and hence can be allocated/executed only on secure server N_{j}.</p>\n\n<p>Now I looked at the Kleinberg/Tardos book and I found a section (11.7) on the more generic load balancing problem (load balancing with constraints) and I found that this problem is an exact match for the situation I am in. The Generic Load Balancing problem has been converted from IP to LP taking advantage of the fact that LP can result in fractional assignment of jobs to machines which has later been rounded off adding an additional O(MN) time to the process. This approximation solution has then been shown to be within a factor of 2 times from the minimum possible. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone point me to some C/Java/Python/MATLAB code where this algorithm has been implemented? As KL book hardly gives any examples or sample pseudo/actual code, it is hard to get the algorithm internalized completely sometimes. Also as for the linear programming part of the problem - what kind of an implementation is suitable for it - Simplex/Interior Point? How much difference will it make when complexity from this LP part is added to the problem (to the fractional re-assignment part)?

If K is even, though, we use two lines of x'es to mark the horizontal and vertical line of symmetry. Moreover, we can't use more than two loops in the whole source.</p>\n\n<p>So I have two ideas. The first is to analyze the coordinates each of the points should fulfill - there should be an equation for each of the points telling us if a given (Kx, Ky) point is x or o. We put it in the alternation of some if and just while-loop through all possible (Kx, Ky) marking some spots as x and others as y. This requires one loop.</p>\n\n<p>The other idea, quite brute-force but not making us analyze all the points, is to have a set of variables we then use for concatenating the strings. Let me explain: we have one while loop checking the \"height\" variable (each turn we decrement it by one) inside which we use a custom method of some repeatString consisting of one while-loop as well (it just multiplies the string by given t times). So we have something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while(height):\nif height==maxHeight OR ==0: print repeatString(\"x\", maxWidth)\nelse if height is an element of markedKy (an array telling us which Ky's to mark as x'es as the whole): print repearString(\"x\", maxWidth)\nelse print \"x\"+(howManySpaces*\" \")+\"x\" [\"xx\" if even] + (howManySpaces*\" \") +\"x\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and so on.

The reason this is not always used is because it requires us to check (n-1)! possible routes, and that number gets huge as 'n' increases- in fact, with just 50 cities, that would be 608281864034267560872252163321295376887552831379210240000000000 routes to check.</p>\n\n<p><em>ASSUME FOR ALL EXAMPLES TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POST THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN ARBITRARY REGION WITH 4 CITIES</em> (even though the algorithm can handle n cities. also we don't care about distances- we want to hit every possible route in brute force).</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple picture demoing what I'm talking about (4 cities is what I'm starting with to check if the process is working properly)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0050300707002.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">picture of map with cities</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the Brute Force algorithm (assume all other called methods work correctly, because they do):</p>\n\n<p>(check below for a bit more explanation)</p>\n\n<p>[code]</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void BruteForceFindBestRoute(Route r) //Must start r having 1 unflagged city to begin with\n    {\n        if(!r.allFlagged() &amp;&amp; r.route.size() != m.cities.size())\n        {\n            /*STEP 1 Begin with last unflagged city*/\n            City pivot = r.lastCityAdded();\n            /*STEP 2: Flag city*/\n            pivot.visited = true;\n            /*STEP 3: Find cities \"NOT IN ROUTE\"*/\n            ArrayList&lt;City&gt; citiesNotInRoute = new ArrayList&lt;City&gt;();\n            for(int i = 0; i&lt;m.cities.size(); i++)\n            {\n                if(!r.isCityInRoute(m.cities.get(i).name))\n                {\n                    citiesNotInRoute.add(m.cities.get(i));\n                }\n            }\n            /*STEP 4: Recursively call BruteForceFindBestRoute() using these cities added to the end of our original route*/\n            for(int i = 0; i&lt;citiesNotInRoute.size(); i++)\n            {\n                Route newRoute = r;\n                newRoute.addToRoute(citiesNotInRoute.get(i));\n                BruteForceFindBestRoute(newRoute);\n            }\n        }\n        /*STEP 5: If the route is full but the last city isn't flagged, then flag it call BruteForceFindBestRoute() again, with the last city flagged*/\n        else if(!r.allFlagged() &amp;&amp; r.route.size() == m.cities.size())\n        {\n            if(r.allFlaggedButLast())\n            {\n                Route x = r;\n                x.flagLastCity();\n                BruteForceFindBestRoute(x);\n            }\n        }\n        /*STEP 6: If all cities are flagged, the route is full.

However, after it gets to the bottom, one would expect the recursion to jump back up to step4, which it does. However, instead of R having city A flagged and city B unflagged and then recursively calling itself on the \"new route\" containing Aflag and B, R now has all 4 cities included, and all 4 are flagged. It fails because it adds city D again to \"newRoute\", recursively calls itself again, and in another method we get an array out of bounds error because there aren't 5 cities in my region, but there incorrectly are 5 cities in route r (A,B,C,D,D). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii191/om3n07/46049b90.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helpful picture of recursive tree structure</a></p>\n\n<p>The problem has something to do with calling recursion in the loop, or route 'r' being referenced within a recursive call.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any idea what I need to do, I would SERIOUSLY appreciate some help.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to anyone who will help me out.

I will state the problem and then what I have tried and perhaps someone can point me in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have a bag of items (unordered, duplicates permitted).  In practice the bag may contain 2-20 items in case this relaxation helps.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to find the minimum length chain (ordered link list in case we have different notions of a chain) which contains all of the items in the bag in any order.</p>\n\n<p>A chain consists of a start token (not present in bag) followed by any number of items followed by an end token (also not in bag).</p>\n\n<p>The chain is formed by piecing together n-tuples (order is important) and as a further relaxation let us say the n value is the same for all tuples.  In practice, I am working with n = 3.  Chains may be \"blended\" as opposed to concatenated if they have overlapping elements.  For example, consider (a,b,c) and (c,d,e).  The may be joined as (a,b,c,d,e).  Likewise, (a,b,c) and (b,c,d) may be joined as (a,b,c,d).  Some tuples may have a start token in the first position and some tokens make have an end token in the last position which of course allows there to be a solution to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem to me that an exact solution to the problem is not tractable in general.  Some sort of optimization algorithm would be necessary in order to get a \"good\" solution to the problem.  \"Good\" solutions I can live with.</p>\n\n<p>What I have started with is a greedy approach where on the first pass you find the tuple which contains the most number of elements in the bag, arbitrarily breaking ties.  Create a data structure which holds the chain we have built so far, and stick the chosen tuple into this data structure.  Split the problem into 2 subproblems, the start token side and the end token side.  Until the first token of the data structure of subproblem 1 is a start token and the last token of subproblem 2 is an end token, grow the chain such that we are trying to find the stop condition as soon as possible (start or end token depending on the subproblem) while also trying to exhaust the contents of the bag as soon as possible.  This may not be good because each subproblem has to communicate with each other as to how many items are left in the bag which need to be included.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone seen this problem anywhere?  Any thoughts as to how to improve (or get to work correctly) this algorithm?  This is a real problem I am tackling which is a smart part of a much larger system and is not a toy problem or a homework problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sorry all I been away from the computer today.  I will try to post an example solution which is not too trivial, yet not too intricate to see.</p>\n\n<p>Given:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>Bag = {A, B, C, D}</code> \n(I make it a set for the sake of example, but each item can appear more than once)</li>\n<li><code>/ = Start Token</code></li>\n<li><code>\\ = End Token</code></li>\n<li><p>3-Tuples (Triples): I label them a-g for simplicity in naming.

In general, the shortest possible path is of length |BAG| + 2, if it in fact exists.

Initially, these numbers are just the\ndegrees of the vertices.</li>\n<li>Initialize an array D such that D[i] contains a list of the\nvertices v that are not already in L for which dv = i.</li>\n<li>Initialize k to 0.</li>\n<li><p>Repeat n times:</p>\n\n<p>1.Scan the array cells D[0], D[1], ... until finding an i for which D[i] is nonempty.</p>\n\n<p>2.Set k to max(k,i)</p>\n\n<p>3.Select a vertex v from D[i].

To put it into a constructive question: Can anyone help create a function/algorithm in JavaScript that can iterate through an array of pairings and optimise the same? ...please?</p>\n\n<pre><code>var firstResult = [{\"from\":\"DE55 7RA\",\"to\":\"DE55 4XJ\",\"oNum\":\"3740003654\",\"dNum\":\"3650645273\",\"metres\":\"536\"},{\"from\":\"WF2 0XF\",\"to\":\"WF2 0XE\",\"oNum\":\"3740003632\",\"dNum\":\"3650645256\",\"metres\":\"304\"},{\"from\":\"WF9 2RH\",\"to\":\"WF9 3AP\",\"oNum\":\"3740003657\",\"dNum\":\"3650645279\",\"metres\":\"4132\"},{\"from\":\"LS10 1BG\",\"to\":\"LS9 8HY\",\"oNum\":\"3740003637\",\"dNum\":\"3650645266\",\"metres\":\"2941\"},{\"from\":\"WF10 5UA\",\"to\":\"WF8 4QD\",\"oNum\":\"3740003646\",\"dNum\":13,\"metres\":\"7248\"},{\"from\":\"HD2 1UA\",\"to\":\"WF15 6JL\",\"oNum\":\"3740003641\",\"dNum\":\"3650645270\",\"metres\":\"6745\"},{\"from\":\"HU14 3HJ\",\"to\":\"HU15 2PE\",\"oNum\":\"3740003640\",\"dNum\":\"3650645259\",\"metres\":\"13309\"},{\"from\":\"WF2 0XF\",\"to\":\"WF5 8NE\",\"oNum\":\"3740003631\",\"dNum\":\"3650645262\",\"metres\":\"9862\"},{\"from\":\"WF9 2XX\",\"to\":\"WF8 4QD\",\"oNum\":\"3740003656\",\"dNum\":83,\"metres\":\"13705\"},{\"from\":\"WF9 2XX\",\"to\":\"WF8 4QD\",\"oNum\":\"3740003647\",\"dNum\":67,\"metres\":\"13705\"},{\"from\":\"WF9 2XR\",\"to\":\"WF8 4QD\",\"oNum\":\"3740003636\",\"dNum\":59,\"metres\":\"13545\"},{\"from\":\"DN14 6XL\",\"to\":\"DN14 0SB\",\"oNum\":\"3740003642\",\"dNum\":\"3650645268\",\"metres\":\"20763\"},{\"from\":\"NG16 4HY\",\"to\":\"NG15 0DR\",\"oNum\":\"3740003635\",\"dNum\":\"3650645258\",\"metres\":\"13165\"},{\"from\":\"DN6 7FB\",\"to\":\"S73 0UN\",\"oNum\":\"3740003639\",\"dNum\":\"3650645255\",\"metres\":\"18835\"},{\"from\":\"LS25 6JH\",\"to\":\"WF6 1GX\",\"oNum\":\"3740003652\",\"dNum\":\"3650645253\",\"metres\":\"22861\"},{\"from\":\"DN3 3FF\",\"to\":\"DN9 1LB\",\"oNum\":\"3740003660\",\"dNum\":\"3650645264\",\"metres\":\"21343\"},{\"from\":\"DN6 7FB\",\"to\":\"S71 3HQ\",\"oNum\":\"3740003638\",\"dNum\":\"3650645278\",\"metres\":\"19268\"},{\"from\":\"S43 4UX\",\"to\":\"S6 1LY\",\"oNum\":\"3740003633\",\"dNum\":\"3650645276\",\"metres\":\"30365\"},{\"from\":\"S43 4UX\",\"to\":\"S6 1LY\",\"oNum\":\"3740003651\",\"dNum\":\"3650645275\",\"metres\":\"30365\"},{\"from\":\"DN14 6XL\",\"to\":\"HU3 4UW\",\"oNum\":\"3740003667\",\"dNum\":\"3650645277\",\"metres\":\"41502\"},{\"from\":\"LS25 6JH\",\"to\":\"LS7 1PZ\",\"oNum\":\"3740003653\",\"dNum\":\"3650645274\",\"metres\":\"25194\"},{\"from\":\"LS25 6JH\",\"to\":\"BD4 0SG\",\"oNum\":\"3740003658\",\"dNum\":\"3650645269\",\"metres\":\"43788\"},{\"from\":\"DN14 6XL\",\"to\":\"HU7 0XS\",\"oNum\":\"3740003648\",\"dNum\":\"3650645265\",\"metres\":\"49066\"},{\"from\":\"NG90 1BS\",\"to\":\"DE6 1EX\",\"oNum\":\"3740003643\",\"dNum\":\"3650645261\",\"metres\":\"44283\"},{\"from\":\"S80 3YY\",\"to\":\"HD6 1LJ\",\"oNum\":\"3740003665\",\"dNum\":\"3650645260\",\"metres\":\"80026\"},{\"from\":\"S80 2RZ\",\"to\":\"BD8 9HQ\",\"oNum\":\"3740003634\",\"dNum\":\"3650645263\",\"metres\":\"95649\"},{\"from\":\"NG90 1BS\",\"to\":\"HU7 0YW\",\"oNum\":\"3740003650\",\"dNum\":\"3650645272\",\"metres\":\"156190\"},{\"from\":\"NG90 1BS\",\"to\":\"HU12 8TB\",\"oNum\":\"3740003644\",\"dNum\":\"3650645267\",\"metres\":\"160285\"},{\"from\":\"NG90 1BS\",\"to\":\"YO17 6YA\",\"oNum\":\"3740003645\",\"dNum\":\"3650645257\",\"metres\":\"172388\"},{\"from\":\"NG90 1BS\",\"to\":\"YO17 9HG\",\"oNum\":\"3740003649\",\"dNum\":\"3650645271\",\"metres\":\"176868\"}],\n    fs = require('fs'),\n    _ = require('underscore'),\n    mongoose = require('mongoose'),\n    Schema = mongoose.Schema,\n    logPostals = fs.createWriteStream('postals.txt', {'flags' : 'w'}),\n    db = mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/legs');\n\nvar Leg = new Schema({\n      from: {\n        type: String,\n        validate: /^([A-PR-UWYZ0-9][A-HK-Y0-9][AEHMNPRTVXY0-9]?[ABEHMNPRVWXY0-9]?

Buyers can tag their needs with keywords; sellers can do the same for what they are selling. I'm interested in finding algorithm(s) that rank-order sellers in terms of their relevance for a particular buyer on the basis of their two keyword sets. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>buyer_keywords = {\"furry\", \"four legs\", \"likes catnip\", \"has claws\"} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then we have two potential sellers that we need to rank order in terms of their relevance: </p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[1] = {\"furry\", \"four legs\", \"arctic circle\", \"white\"}\nseller_keywords[2] = {\"likes catnip\", \"furry\", \n                      \"hates mice\", \"yarn-lover\", \"whiskers\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we just use the intersection of keywords, we do not get much discrimination: both intersect on 2 keywords. If we divide the intersection count by the size of the set union, seller 2 actually does worse because of the greater number of keywords. This would seem to introduce an automatic penalty for any method not correcting keyword set size (and we definitely don't want to penalize adding keywords). </p>\n\n<p>To put a bit more structure on the problem, suppose we have some truthful measure of intensity of keyword attributes (which have to sum to 1 for each seller), e.g.,: </p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[1] = {\"furry\":.05, \n                      \"four legs\":.05, \n                      \"arctic circle\":.8, \n                      \"white\":.1}\n\nseller_keywords[2] = {\"likes catnip\":.5, \n                      \"furry\":.4, \n                      \"hates mice\":.02, \n                      \"yarn-lover\":.02, \n                      \"whiskers\":.06}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we could sum up the value of hits: so now Seller 1 only gets a score of .1, while Seller 2 gets a score of .9. So far, so good, but now we might get a third seller with a very limited, non-descriptive keyword set:</p>\n\n<pre><code>seller_keywords[3] = {\"furry\":1}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This catapults them to the top for any hit on their sole keyword, which isn't good.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my guess (and hope) is that this is a fairly general problem and that there exist different algorithmic solutions with known strengths and limitations. This is probably something covered in CS101, so I think a good answer to this question might just be a link to the relevant references.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","web-services","nlp","graph-theory","semantic"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":555,"score":6,"question_id":571932,"title":"Building or Finding a \"relevant terms\" suggestion feature","body":"<p>Given a few words of input, I want to have a utility that will return a diverse set of relevant terms, phrases, or concepts.

As far as I know, no library currently exists for this algorithm, and there is very little information available, so it's been difficult.</p>\n\n<p>My main resource has been the <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kdeng/thesis/logistic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">dissertation of Dr. Kan Deng</a>, in which he described the algorithm in what I feel is pretty light detail.  My work so far on the library is <a href=\"https://github.com/orthogonal/USCF-Stats/blob/master/lib/LocalLogisticRegression.rb\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've run into trouble when trying to calculate <code>B</code> (beta).  From what I understand, <code>B</code> is a <code>(1+d x 1)</code> vector that represents the local weighting for a particular point.  After that, <code>pi</code> (the probability of a positive output) for that point is the sigmoid function based on the <code>B</code> for that point.  To get <code>B</code>, use the Newton-Raphson algorithm recursively a certain number of times, probably no more than ten.</p>\n\n<p>Equation 4-4 on page 66, the Newton-Raphson algorithm itself, doesn't make sense to me.  Based on my understanding of what <code>X</code> and W are, <code>(x.transpose * w * x).inverse * x.transpose * w</code> should be a <code>(1+d x N)</code> matrix, which doesn't match up with <code>B</code>, which is <code>(1+d x 1)</code>.  The only way that would work, then, is if e were a <code>(N x 1)</code> vector.</p>\n\n<p>At the top of page 67, under the picture, though, Dr. Deng just says that e is a ratio, which doesn't make sense to me.  Is e Euler's Constant, and it just so happens that that ratio is always 2.718:1, or is it something else?  Either way, the explanation doesn't seem to suggest, to me, that it's a vector, which leaves me confused.</p>\n\n<p>The use of <code>pi'</code> is also confusing to me.  Equation 4-5, the derivative of the sigmoid function w.r.t. B, gives a constant multiplied by a vector, or a vector.  From my understanding, though, <code>pi'</code> is just supposed to be a number, to be multiplied by w and form the diagonal of the weight algorithm W.</p>\n\n<p>So, my two main questions here are, what is <code>e</code> on page 67 and is that the <code>1xN</code> matrix I need, and how does <code>pi'</code> in equation 4-5 end up a number?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that this is a difficult question to answer, so if there is a good answer then I will come back in a few days and give it a fifty point bounty.

The number of sensors is not fixed - they can be added and removed, each sensor one has its own unique identifier. Sensors send data irregularly - they can keep silence for weeks or push data every second. Each sensor generates a value from a fixed set of values ​​- so sensors are discrete. My program logs each message from each sensor into SQL database table (sensorId, time, value).</p>\n\n<p>The task is to filter the information. I need to select only one record from this log, which I'm considering to be the actual information. For example, if I get the latest record from a single sensor, which says that value is A, but before it 10 different sensors told me that the value is B, then I shall still consider B to be the actual information. At the same time the problem is not just the usual noise filtering, because if there was one sensor which told me for a month every second that value was C, and then five sensors recently tell that in fact the value is D, I shall immediately consider D to be the actual data despite long history - I want to say that the number of independent sources also must have weight.</p>\n\n<p>So, I think I get a kind of a function of two variables - time (aging) and the number of unique sensors in the moment of time.

I'm thinking a range of cities something like from 100 to 12000.</p>\n\n<p>In more detail, as an example, there's a cost <strong>COST<sub>1</sub></strong> on travelling from city <strong>A</strong> to city <strong>B</strong>, e.g. by foot, and a cost <strong>COST<sub>1</sub>/10</strong> to travel from <strong>B</strong> to <strong>A</strong>, e.g. by train. In other words, the problem I see here is that if I have an asymmetric matrix <strong>C</strong> representing costs between travelling cities and I select one point <strong>A</strong>, how could discover <em>efficiently</em>, say, three nearest neighbouring cities <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong> in terms of travelling cost? I would like to run the queries repeatedly. Preprocessing time, if not huge, is all right.</p>\n\n<p>The efficiency pondering let me to thinking something like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">k-d tree</a>, which faciliates for finding <em>k</em> nearest neighbours in <em>O(lg(n))</em> time when costs between cities are <em>symmetric</em>. This is the snag with just basic k-d tree in my case as the travelling costs aren't in general the same in both directions between any two cities. The gist of the matter seems to be then, how could I do something like k-nearest neighbours in asymmetric case?</p>\n\n<p>To remedy the aforementioned symmetry assumption, I thought that instead of just one tree, I have two trees constructed so that the costs are calculated in both directions, and then I run a search through both trees. Then I became to wonder, does anyone know if there's already something specifically for the purpose of asymmetric costs and/or would using two trees as an idea be totally astray?</p>\n\n<p>It also may be k-d trees in two dimensions isn't necessarily the most fit solution.

Since each \"column\" in the histograms is a uniform distribution, I had hoped that the problem could be solved by convolving these columns and summing the results.  </p>\n\n<p>However the result is considerably more complex than the inputs, and also includes triangles.  <strong>Edit 5:</strong> [Wrong stuff removed].  But if these trapezoids are approximated to rectangles with the same area then you get the Right Answer, and reducing the number of rectangles in the result looks pretty straightforward too.

A histogram with N bars is stored as\n-- | a list of N+1 values.\ndata Continuous = C {\n      cN :: Int,\n      -- ^ Number of bars in the histogram.\n      cAreas :: [Double],\n      -- ^ Areas of the bars.  @length cAreas == cN@\n      cBars :: [Double]\n      -- ^ Boundaries of the bars.  @length cBars == cN + 1@\n    } deriving (Show, Read)\n\n\n{- | Add distributions.  If two random variables @vX@ and @vY@ are\ntaken from distributions @x@ and @y@ respectively then the\ndistribution of @(vX + vY)@ will be @(x .+. y).\n\nThis is implemented as the convolution of distributions x and y.\nEach is a histogram, which is to say the sum of a collection of\nuniform distributions (the \"bars\").  Therefore the convolution can be\ncomputed as the sum of the convolutions of the cross product of the\ncomponents of x and y.\n\nWhen you convolve two uniform distributions of unequal size you get a\ntrapezoidal distribution. Let p = p2-p1, q - q2-q1.  Then we get:\n\n\n&gt;   |                              |\n&gt;   |     ______                   |\n&gt;   |     |    |           with    |  _____________\n&gt;   |     |    |                   |  |           |\n&gt;   +-----+----+-------            +--+-----------+-\n&gt;         p1   p2                     q1          q2\n&gt; \n&gt;  gives    h|....... _______________\n&gt;            |       /:             :\\\n&gt;            |      / :             : \\                1\n&gt;            |     /  :             :  \\     where h = -\n&gt;            |    /   :             :   \\              q\n&gt;            |   /    :             :    \\\n&gt;            +--+-----+-------------+-----+-----\n&gt;             p1+q1  p2+q1       p1+q2   p2+q2\n\nHowever we cannot keep the trapezoid in the final result because our\nrepresentation is restricted to uniform distributions.  So instead we\nstore a uniform approximation to the trapezoid with the same area:\n\n&gt;           h|......___________________\n&gt;            |     | /               \\ |\n&gt;            |     |/                 \\|\n&gt;            |     |                   |\n&gt;            |    /|                   |\\\n&gt;            |   / |                   | \\\n&gt;            +-----+-------------------+--------\n&gt;               p1+q1+p/2          p2+q2-p/2\n\n-}\n(.+.) :: Continuous -&gt; Continuous -&gt; Continuous\nc .+. d = C {cN     = length bars - 1,\n             cBars  = map fst bars, \n             cAreas = zipWith barArea bars (tail bars)}\n    where\n      -- The convolve function returns a list of two (x, deltaY) pairs.\n      -- These can be sorted by x and then sequentially summed to get\n      -- the new histogram.

The field is manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is I am taking read-only data from a massive Sybase server, filtering it and creating much smaller tables in Access daily (using delete and append Queries) and then doing a bunch of stuff. More specifically, I use a series of queries to either combine data from multiple tables or group data in specific ways (aggregate functions), and then I place this data into a table (so I can sort and manipulate data using DAO.recordset and run multiple custom algorithms). This process is then repeated multiple times throughout the database until a set of relevant tables are created.</p>\n\n<p>Many times I will create a field in a query with a value such as 1.1 so that when I append it to a table I can store information in the field from the algorithms.

Then for subsequent sets, it iterates over all element of itself and the ith set of the collection, and removes items from itself as needed.</li>\n<li>Using <code>std::set_intersection</code> into a temporary <code>std::set</code>, swap contents to a current set, then again find intersection of the current set with the next set and insert into the temp set, and so on.</li>\n<li>Manually iterate over all the elements of all sets like in 1), but using a <code>vector</code> as the destination container instead of <code>std::set</code>.</li>\n<li>Same as in 4, but using a <code>std::list</code> instead of a <code>vector</code>, suspecting a <code>list</code> will provide faster deletions from the middle.</li>\n<li>Using hash sets (<code>std::unordered_set</code>) and checking for all items in all sets.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As it turned out, using a <code>vector</code> is marginally faster when the number of elements in each set is small, and <code>list</code> is marginally faster for larger sets. In-place using <code>set</code> is a substantially slower than both, followed by <code>set_intersection</code> and hash sets. Is there a faster algorithm/datastructure/tricks to achieve this? I can post code snippets if required.

(related to TSP, dynamic programming)","body":"<p>The below question is applied specifically for a biotech application but may illustrate general principles for similar problems in other fields. It is an NP-hard problem that can be related to the Traveling Salesman Problem and I am curious what algorithms can be used to arrive at solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brief Bio background</strong>: Proteins are composed of 20 amino acids. DNA is composed of 4 bases - A, C, G, T. The DNA sequence for the protein determines the sequence of amino acids - each consecutive sequence of 3 DNA bases (the unit is called a codon) codes for one amino acid. A single amino acid can be coded by multiple codons, for example Valine has 4 ways of being coded.</p>\n\n<p>Not all codons are made equal - some of them are processed faster than others. Also, not all codon PAIRS are made equal - some pairs are slower than others.</p>\n\n<p>This means that for a particular gene of 100 amino acids (300 DNA bases), there are many ways of coding the same amino acid sequence, but with very different properties, such as processing speed. </p>\n\n<p>Given a table of codon pairs with corresponding speed values, we'd like to write an algorithm that <strong>can output a sequence of desired speed</strong>, e.g. the fastest and slowest possible sequences, and a gradient in between. The input is a DNA sequence coding for a gene, and a dictionary of codon pairs and their respective speed score (-1 to 1). The output is the optimized DNA sequence and its whole speed score (which can be represented as a sum of all codon pair scores). The amino acid sequence must remain the same.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: if we have sequence AAATTTGGG coding for 3 amino acids, and we have the codon pairs with scores:</p>\n\n<p>AAATTT = -0.5</p>\n\n<p>TTTGGG = -0.5</p>\n\n<p>then this sequence might have a score of -1. </p>\n\n<p>Now if we also have the pair alternatives we can assess different possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>AAATTG = -0.7\nAAATTC = -0.3</p>\n\n<p>TTGGGC = +0.2\nTTCGGA = -1.0</p>\n\n<p>One would find that the optimum sequence based on this info is AAATTCGGA since it gives an overall value of -1.3.</p>\n\n<p>The complexity of this problem of course lies in the influence of a codon pair on all surrounding codon pairs.</p>\n\n<p>The full codon pair chart would have 61*61 entries (because 3 codons stop the reading of the gene).</p>\n\n<p>====</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe this is an NP-hard problem and has relations to the TSP.

My main problem isn't with the C++ code or syntax, but with my algorithm to divide. When I multiply I am able to do it digit by digit. I store each product (aka 1's digit of bottom times every digit above, then 10's digit time every num above using my carry algorithm) in my 2d array. Every time I get new product it is offset to the left by n + 1, which \"multiplies\" it by the required power of 10. Then I just sum up all the columns.</p>\n\n<p>I can't for the life of me figure out how to code the long division method. Since I'm dealing with two arrays it has to be digit by digit, and I suspect it might be as easy as reversing the multiplication algorithm. Nested loops and subtraction? I would need a variable for the quotient and reminder? Is there a better method? I just need to be pointed in the right direction.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","matrix"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":106,"score":0,"question_id":12868040,"title":"Strassen's Algorithm Returning Zero","body":"<p>The idea is to create a timer that will return how long it takes to perform a certain function.

So, given an array of such friends, I want to find the likes which is liked by the most number of friends, and <em>also</em> the friends who liked this thing. Essentially, I want to show something like \"Your friend X, Y &amp; Z likes this.\"</p>\n\n<p>My first solution is to use a Map (for storing the reverse mapping: like->set)and a Priority Queue (for finding the top N). Here is my algorithm (using C++ STL):</p>\n\n<pre><code>map&lt; like, set&lt;friend&gt; &gt; like2friendsMap;\nfor each friend {\n  for each like {\n    like2friendsMap[like].insert(friend); //populate the map\n  }\n}\n\npriority_queue&lt; pair&lt;like, int&gt; &gt; pq;\nfor each like in like2friendsMap {\n  int count = like2friendsMap[like].size(); //no. of friends who like this or \"popularity\"\n  pq.push(like, count); //count is the priority\n}\n\nmap&lt; like, set&lt;friend&gt; &gt; result\nfor i in 1 to N { //N is how many popular items I want\n   result = pq.top();  //gives me the element with highest priority (most popular like)\n   pq.pop();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As STL internally uses Red Black Tree for implementing map and min/max heap for priority queue, this approach seems pretty fast to me. But if I have 100s of friends and each have 100s of likes, the memory usage would be huge. Of course, instead of storing the whole objects, I should use friend id and like id for all calculations which would reduce memory usage a lot.</p>\n\n<p>What other algorithm or data structure can be used to improve efficiency (increase speed, reduce memory)? For some reason, I can't store the list of friends against each like, it must be computed in run time. I am developing this using C++, so solutions using STL or boost would be even better. </p>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","clrs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":2,"question_id":12850008,"title":"Recurrence in analysis of SELECT algorithm","body":"<p>In CLRS <code>(2/e, page 191, section 9.3)</code> the analysis of the <code>SELECT</code> algorithm for finding the ith smallest element in an array is presented with the following induction proof:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1.

I'm thinking about what's the best way to represent the solution. His approach is quite simple, he has an array where he maps an index to a timeslot-room and the solution is a simple array containing a list of these indexes, where each timeslot-room element is removed from the array after being picked.</p>\n\n<p>For example, given 3 timeslots and 3 rooms, this is the array mapping the timeslots+rooms:<br/>\n0: timeslot 0, room 0<br/>\n1: timeslot 0, room 1<br/>\n2: timeslot 0, room 2<br/>\n3: timeslot 1, room 0<br/>\n4: timeslot 1, room 1<br/>\n5: timeslot 1, room 2<br/>\n6: timeslot 2, room 0<br/>\n7: timeslot 2, room 1<br/>\n8: timeslot 2, room 2</p>\n\n<p>Let's say there are 9 sessions to be scheduled in.

Isn't this how evolution works? It looks like that the way that Mark Swanson represents the solution doesn't take it into consideration.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the case of crossover:<br/>\nParent 1: 5,5,2,1,2,3,1,1,0<br/>\nParent 2: 0,0,0,0,4,3,2,1,0<br/>\nChild:    5,5,2,1,4,3,2,1,0 (crossover index is 4 in this case)</p>\n\n<p>The child has 4 genes in common with parent 1 and 5 with parent 2. But if you write down the actual solution as I've done above (session x, timeslot x, room x), you will quickly realise that the child solution has pretty much nothing in common with parent 2. Isn't this a problem?</p>\n\n<p>Another example, for the mutation this time:<br/>\nBefore mutation: 5,5,2,1,2,3,1,1,0<br/>\nAfter mutation:  0,5,2,1,2,3,1,1,0</p>\n\n<p>This small change caused 6 out of 9 changes on the actual final solution.</p>\n\n<p>Are these things I raised actual issues? Or it doesn't matter because the genetic algorithm will work well anyway? And if these are issues, can you suggest any better solution?</p>\n\n<p>Another question I have is: what if a session has to be scheduled several times?

At that point, the recursion goes all the way down the graph until it either reaches a node with no children or the goal node. If it reaches a node with no children that isn't the goal, the base case is ignored, and the entire for loop is ignored, returning a value of none. That None then is simply passed up the chain of recursion. If it reaches the goal node, then the bottom layer of the recursion actually returns a value (path), which bubbles up to the top of the recursion.</p>\n\n<p>At that point I get confused, because of what is going on with \"shortest.\" So every time an actual value is returned for newPath, shortest is assigned that value, but then it is added to path.

Right now I only take into account the cost of each activity, but obviously it is not enough because in case like the one in picture below, critical path computed is not accurate : \n<img src=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img688/2420/casemp.png\" alt=\"one fail case for algorithm above\"></p>\n\n<p>Obviously activity B is critical (if its end time is shifted, the end of project is also shifted) but the algorithm compute a slack of 1...</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how to change the algorithm to make it work for case above. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","algorithm","graph","matching","bipartite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":137,"score":2,"question_id":12810085,"title":"Maximum Bipartite Matching C++","body":"<p>I'm solving a matching problem with two <code>vectors</code> of a <code>class</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>class matching\n{\npublic:\n    int n;\n    char match;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the algorithm I'm trying to implement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int augment(vector&lt;matching&gt; &amp;left, vector&lt;matching&gt; &amp;right)\n{\n   while(there's no augmenting path)\n     if(condition for matching)\n        &lt;augment&gt;\n  return \"number of matching\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the rough matching, if <code>left[i]</code> matches with <code>right[j]</code>, then <code>left[i].n = j</code>, <code>left[i].match ='M'</code> , <code>right[j].n = i</code> and <code>right[j].match = 'M'</code> and the unmatched ones have members <code>n = -1</code> and <code>match = 'U'</code></p>\n\n<p>While finding the augmenting paths, if one exists for another (i, j), then we change the member <code>match</code> of the one being unmatched from <code>'M'</code> to <code>'U'</code>  and its <code>n = -1</code>  and the two matched with the augmenting path have their members <code>match</code> changed to 'A' while we change their members <code>n</code> according to their indices.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is the right approach to solving this, this is my first attempt on  maximum matching and I've read a lot of articles and watched tutorials online and I can't get my 'code' to function appropriately.</p>\n\n<p>I do not need a code, I can write my code.

Based on what I learned from the class, </p>\n\n<p>I have a set of training data that's results of matches.  The player is given a number, their opponent is given a number, and the result is 1 for a win and 0 for a loss.  The data is a little noisy because of upsets, but not terribly so.  My goal is to find which rating gaps are more prone to upsets - for instance, my intuition tells me that lower-rated matches tend to entail more upsets because the ratings are less accurate.</p>\n\n<p>So I got a training set of about 100 examples.  Each example is (rating, delta) => 1/0.  So it's a classification problem, but not really one that I think lends itself to a logistic regression-type chart, and a neural network seemed more correct.</p>\n\n<p>My code begins </p>\n\n<pre><code>training_data = RubyFann::TrainData.new(:inputs =&gt; inputs, :desired_outputs =&gt; outputs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then set up the neural network with</p>\n\n<pre><code>network = RubyFann::Standard.new(\n  :num_inputs=&gt;2, \n  :hidden_neurons=&gt;[8, 8, 8, 8], \n  :num_outputs=&gt;1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the class, I learned that a reasonably default is to have each hidden layer with the same number of units.

Unfortunately, then I started getting either my starting delta or my maximum delta for every input every time.  </p>\n\n<p>I don't really understand why I'm getting such divergent results or what Ruby-FANN is telling me, partly because I don't understand the library but also, I suspect, because I just started learning about neural networks and am missing something big and obvious.

The issue that I am having is that I cannot simply calculate, say, the PPV using each potential cut-off score and take the average, as each of the PPVs would technically be nested.</p>\n\n<p>How can I account for this in an equation and are there standard nested weighting strategies I should be trying?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","alpha-beta-pruning"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":54,"score":-1,"question_id":12772501,"title":"alpha-beta pruning implementation stuck","body":"<p>i'm trying to implement alpha-beta prunning algorithm to 9Men's Morris game.\nSo far i have this function : </p>\n\n<pre><code>private int getBestMove(board board, int depth, int alpha, int beta, boolean bIsMax)\n{\n    if (depth == 0 || board.checkWinner()!=0) \n    {\n        // if depth reached, or we DO have a winner.\n        return board.evaluateBoard();\n    }\n\n\n    if (bIsMax)\n    {\n        // generate all possible boards for MAX.\n        ArrayList&lt;board&gt; boardsArray = board.generateNextPossibleBoards(bIsMax);\n\n        // loop thru all these generated boards.\n        for(board nextBoard: boardsArray)\n        {\n            int score = Math.max(alpha, getBestMove(nextBoard, depth - 1, alpha, beta, !bIsMax));\n\n            // found a better board ?\n            if ( score &gt; alpha )\n            {\n                alpha = score;\n                chosenBoard = nextBoard;\n            }\n\n            // prune\n            if (beta &lt; score)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // clear boards array when done.\n        boardsArray.clear();\n\n        // return alpha.\n        return alpha;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // generate all possible boards for MIN.\n        ArrayList&lt;board&gt; boardsArray = board.generateNextPossibleBoards(bIsMax);\n\n        // loop thru all these possible boards.\n        for(board nextBoard: boardsArray)\n        {\n            beta = Math.min(beta, getBestMove(nextBoard, depth - 1, alpha, beta, !bIsMax));\n\n            // prune \n            if (beta &lt; alpha)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // clear boards array when done.\n        boardsArray.clear();\n\n        // return beta.\n        return beta;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is my evaluateBoard() function :</p>\n\n<pre><code>// evaluate current board.\npublic int evaluateBoard() \n{\n    int score = 0;\n\n    score = score + (checkWinner());                // checkWinner() returns    -1000000 if player wins, +1000000 if opponent wins.

The goal is to use it as a teaching tool for learning language by practicing different patterns of a question and answer. </p>\n\n<p>For example, we may practice the question \"Have you ever tried...?\" plus one of four activities, such as bungee jumping, para sailing, skydiving, and scuba diving.

For example, card 1 would look like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>skydiving: Yes I have, and I enjoyed it.</li>\n<li>scuba diving: Yes I have, but I didn't like it.</li>\n<li>parasailing: No I haven't, but I want to try it.</li>\n<li>bungee jumping: No I haven't, and I don't want to try it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The next card might then look like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>skydiving: Yes I have, but I didn't like it.</li>\n<li>scuba diving: No I haven't, but I want to try it.</li>\n<li>parasailing: No I haven't, and I don't want to try it.</li>\n<li>bungee jumping: Yes I have, and I liked it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So as you can see, there are many different possible combinations.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>boxes.push_back(box(4,12,32));\nboxes.push_back(box(1,2,3));\nboxes.push_back(box(2,5,6));\nhighest_stack(boxes, used, cur, boxes.size(), 0, max_height);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the function <code>highest_stack</code>, there is one line <code>cout &lt;&lt; height &lt;&lt; endl;</code> for output. If I comment <code>no_suitable = true;</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the output is: 1 2 4; 1 2; 1, 1 4;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>if I don't comment <code>no_suitable = true;</code> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the output is: 1 2 4; 2 4; 4; 1 2; 2; 1; 1 4; 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both of them can give the correct result which is 7.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>My question is:\n(1) Can anyone help me verify my solution?\n(2) Is there any more elegant recursive code for this problem? \n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>I don't think  my code is elegant.\n      Thanks</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["algorithm","language-agnostic","combinatorics"],"answer_count":18,"favorite_count":6,"up_vote_count":19,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14543,"score":19,"question_id":2344496,"title":"How can I print out all possible letter combinations a given phone number can represent?","body":"<p>I just tried for my first programming interview and one of the questions was to write a program that given a 7 digit telephone number, could print all possible combinations of letters that each number could represent.</p>\n\n<p>A second part of the question was, what about if this was a 12 digit international number?

Now find all the smaller sub-strings (up until the length of 2) and calculate their scores the same way. Among all the sub-strings found this way, a sub-string with the largest score wins and gets into the lexicon. The sub-string is then replaced in the initial set of strings by the references to it, and the process repeats until our set of strings only contains single chars and lexicon references. After that, introduce all the remaining single chars into the lexicon and replace them with their references in the set. The explanation of the scoring is the following: we remove <code>substring_length</code> chars from each occurrence, add a reference instead (hence <code>-1</code>), and need <code>substring_length</code> chars to store the sub-string (hence <code>-substring_length</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Any better approach you can think of?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","c","algorithm","dynamic-programming"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":84,"score":1,"question_id":12685834,"title":"algorithm to save states for dynamic programming","body":"<p>Here's a question regarding saving states in a problem using dynamic programming. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Every problem of DP saves results and use them further to reduce computation.

Or, we can also say that it has linear complexity O(n).</p>\n\n<p>For merge sort, we need to do mergesort for root(n) elements that are unsorted, which will give root(n)log(root (n)) complexity.

The group of entries that shared the same Query and Epoc values are to be considered as -one- entry, so in order to match a pair, another entrie has to be found that matches the 'Query' value.
