Originally I've designed it in Java. There are 15*15 fields that need to be displayed.

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to do the same on a mobile platform (I mean using 225 gesture recognizers doesn't sound too promising). There is another approach which merges all those fields into one big view which is responsible for the drawing and event handling by doing some math with screen coordinates.

It's a tab bar application for iPad set up in Xcode.  I added a tab bar item to the navigation bar in one of the view controllers.

In <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> I just set the cell's label text and return it.  When a row is selected, I generate another instance of the same class and push it on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Without doing anything at all with the <code>contentSizeForViewInPopover</code> property on any VC, the popover just goes to its maximum height and stays there no matter how many rows are in my table view.</p>\n\n<p>If I set the size in viewDidAppear, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.numItems * 44);\n  [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n{\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it flashes very quickly to full height and then snaps to the height I set.</li>\n<li>When a new controller is pushed on the navigation controller, it snaps to its height with no animation.</li>\n<li>When I navigate back, if the VC that I'm popping to is taller than the one I'm popping from, it animates to the correct size.  If what I'm popping to is smaller, it does nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing but in <code>viewWillAppear</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it's full-height</li>\n<li>When I first tap a row and get a new controller on the stack, it animates to a minimum of about 400px tall.  When a new controller is pushed on the stack, if it needs more height it gets it.  If not it stays at what it was before.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, it's basically the same as <code>viewWillAppear</code> except it appears at the right size at first.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried setting the nav controller's delegate to be the VC that presents the popover, and then set the popover's height (<code>setPopoverContentSize:animated:</code>) in <code>navigationController:didShowViewController:animated:</code>, but the resultant height is off by a little bit.  I think the size I set there needs to take into account the extra height of the navigation bar built into the top of the popover.

This is normal.</p>\n\n<p>But once they select a photo, another screen is pushed on the navigation stack of the photo picker with just the image, \"Move and Scale\" as the title, and cancel and choose text near the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>Is this a bug running an iPhone app on an iPad? Because I know that you need to present photo pickers in a popoverController on the iPad. </p>\n\n<p>When I try to do the same using the native contacts app, the move and scale screen is shown inside the popover. Anybody else encounter this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","ios5","twitter"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":0,"question_id":11113409,"title":"How can I rearrange Twitter attachments (Photo and URL)","body":"<p>I am attaching a UIImage and a NSUrl to a TwitterViewController using addImage and addUrl.

As long as they remain in the same position everything is fine (i.e. if their <code>layoutAttributes.frame</code> does not change).</p>\n\n<p>However as soon as I re-layout with changed <code>layoutAttributes</code> for either decoration or supplementary views they get visually duplicated - i.e. there is a copy in the background at their original location and a copy at their new location.

This is the intended behavior.  </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're on element 1 of the pickerView.  If you scroll to element 0 (by dragging the component downwards)...and go past it (dragging the 0 element far down the picker view beyond the blue selection box)...when you let go, the pickerView will scroll back to element 0 in order to center it back in the blue selection box, and then call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we take the same example...(ie you're on element 1 of the pickerView, and scroll far beyond element 0)...if the pickerView is in the middle of scrolling back to element 0, and you quickly click element 0 or the white space above it, then the pickerView will awkwardly \"jump\" from wherever it is in the scroll animation straight to element 0, and then WON'T call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big issue, as we are now on element 0 without actually calling didSelectRow...thus, we have no indication that we are no longer on element 1.

The app. has a \"+\" and a \"-\" button for zooming in-and-out in user-defined increments (it is an app. for the visually impaired).</p>\n\n<p>This +/- zoom-button functionality previously worked 100% fine when my app. used a UIImageView inside of a UIScrollView (instead of the WebView). The ImageView was the actual view which was zoomed, and the CenterPoint was calculated for the ScrollView's zoomToRect method.</p>\n\n<p>I now have a WebView, which I know contains a ScrollView as a subview. I tried adapting the code which previously worked with the ImageView/ScrollView combo to instead zoom the WebView's ScrollView, <strong>but it is no longer calculating the CenterPoint correctly for zoomToRect:</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The WebView zooms correctly in-terms of the zoom-level, but the center point is always wrong. For some reason, the screen always zooms-in on the top-left every time.</p>\n\n<p>Another odd problem, is that after the very first time you zoom-in, you cannot scroll in the WebView past the visible portion of the screen. If you try to, it shows a bit of the content past the bounds of the currently visible area, but it instantly snaps-back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to zoom the UIWebView's ScrollView. </p>\n\n<p>I create a pointer to the ScrollView, and set \"self\" as its delegate. I then setup various variables, such as scrSize (the size of the view to zoom) and ZoomHandler (explained below):</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {\n  // ... Various UIWebView setup ...    \n  [self LoadURL];\n\n  // Zooming &amp; scrollview setup\n  zoomHandler = [[ZoomHandler alloc] initWithZoomLevel: ZOOM_STEP];\n  scrSize = CGPointMake(self.WebView.frame.size.width, self.WebView.frame.size.height);\n\n  scrollView = [WebView.subviews objectAtIndex:0];\n  [scrollView setTag:ZOOM_VIEW_TAG];\n  [scrollView setMinimumZoomScale:MINIMUM_SCALE];\n  [scrollView setZoomScale:1];\n  [scrollView setMaximumZoomScale:10];\n  scrollView.bounces = FALSE;\n  scrollView.bouncesZoom = FALSE;\n  scrollView.clipsToBounds = NO;\n  [scrollView setDelegate:self];\n\n  [super viewDidLoad];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To override the WebView's default zooming limitations, I inject this Javascript into the loaded webpage in the webViewDidFinishLoad: method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function increaseMaxZoomFactor() {\n  var element = document.createElement('meta');\n  element.name = \"viewport\";\n  element.content = \"maximum-scale=10 minimum-scale=1 initial-scale=1 user-scalable=yes width=device-width height=device-height;\"\n  var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n  head.appendChild(element);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>CenterPoint Code:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This code is used to calculate the CenterPoint to pass into zoomToRect:.

I have the auto-resizing mask all set correctly so that it's centered. I think the issue is that the view bounds on landscape is still 768x1024 instead of 1024x768. Any idea on this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ipad"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13102824,"title":"How do I debug a memory crash that occurs without calling didRecieveMemoryWarning?","body":"<p>I think the question more or less explains the situation.</p>\n\n<p>I'm getting reports of memory crashes on old iPad 1 devices, but as we're tracking it down we've noticed something extremely odd.</p>\n\n<p>The crash is a memory crash, but the app doesn't call the memory warning function correctly first.

I presume they are simply logging location points and having those points written to an XML file.  Is this correct?  Does anyone know of any documentation online that I could be directed to? If it's simply a KML that is being created on the mobile device, I believe exporting would be fairly easy by translating to CSV and importing to other programs.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding data collection/creation, I also need the ability to collect/create while offline.  I believe I can use something like the Bad Elf GPS for offline data collection (www.bad-elf.com), so my question is more in regards to storage.

If so, would this allow me to view the data Im creating live on-screen as it is being created?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lastly, any thoughts on developing in HTML5/CSS/Javascript?

When the application launches the device actively becomes a client searching for servers who are broadcasting files. When the client sees a server it adds a badge to its tab and adds an entry to it's table.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I am having is the GKSession only allows for one string to be transmitted before the connection is established -The peer Display Name. What I would like to transmit is the file name, number of pages and maybe a thumbnail.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can currently think of to achieve this behaviour is to automatically connect the client and servers, exchange the file information and then automatically disconnect them. This may work well if there is only one or two files currently broadcasting, there is likely to be threading/synchronisation issues when lots of different devices are broadcasting.</p>\n\n<p>For example 7 files may be available. So the client would have to connect to them one by one in order to receive information for all the files. This is likely to take a fair amount of time and the user may have already decided that they wish to download 'file 1'. By tapping 'file 1' a connection should be made and the transfer should begin. This may not be able to happen instantly if the client is busy retrieving information about the other available files. </p>\n\n<p>I have also read some issues with connecting to a server again shortly after disconnecting from it..

Clicking to a second tab / back again causes the content to appear as if the page doesn't draw off-screen content. After this, if I then scroll back up to the top of the page the content isn't drawn for the start of the page (which was previously visible). Scrolling the page up and down a few times with a <em>two-finger</em> scroll resolves the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I had read <a href=\"http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/new-mobile-safari-stuff-in-ios5-position-fixed-overflow-scroll-new-input-type-support-web-workers-ecmascript-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"this article\">this article</a> that stated that the problem was fixed. But it doesn't seem to be fully fixed; and still doesn't get around the issue that because you have to wrap your iframe in a div and put scrollbars on that div, desktop browsers <em>may</em> show a double scrollbar depending on how they interpret <code>overflow:auto</code>.</p>\n\n<p>p.s.

The concept for the app is drawing the shapes you see in the clouds. After downloading the app, upon launching <strong>CloudWriter</strong>, the user would be presented with a live video background (from the rear camera), with an OpenGL drawing layer on-top of that. A user would be able to open the app, point the iPad at clouds in the sky and draw what they see on the display. </p>\n\n<p>A major feature of the application is for the user to record a video screen capture of what happens on the display during a session. The live video feed and the \"drawing\" view will become a flat (merged) video. </p>\n\n<p>Some assumptions and background info about how this currently works.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using Apples AVCamCaptureManager, part of the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">AVCam</a> sample project, as a foundation for much of the camera related code. </li>\n<li>Init the AVCamCapture session using <strong>AVCaptureSessionPresetMedium</strong> as the preset.</li>\n<li>Begin to pipe the Camera feed out as a background via the videoPreviewLayer.</li>\n<li>Overlay that live videoPreviewLayer with a view that allows \"drawing\" (finger-paint style) using openGL. The \"drawing\" view background is [UIColor clearColor].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, the idea is that a user could point the iPad3 camera towards some clouds in the sky and draw the shapes they see. This functionality works flawlessly. I begin to run into performance problems when I attempt to make a \"flat\" video screen capture of the users session. The resulting \"flat\" video would have the camera input overlaid in real time with the users drawing's. </p>\n\n<p>A good example of an app that has functionality similar to what we are looking for is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/board-cam-standard-live-exhibitions/id443410754?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Board Cam</a>, available in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>To initiate the process, there is a \"record\" button visible in the view at all times.

Again, capturing full screen, i'm not sure <strong>drawInRect</strong> can provide nearly as much benefit.</p>\n\n<p>To improve performance, I'm thinking that if I were to scale down the image that <strong>imageFromSampleBuffer</strong> provides and the current context of the drawing view, I would see an increase in frame rate.

Pretty much all of our clients are having problems using the touchscreen.  They are pounding on the buttons and the app is not registering a touch.</p>\n\n<p>I had never thought there would be so much difficulty for a user to interact with the touch screen.  I am wondering if there is anything I can do as a developer to make this more user friendly.  There is a slight lag between the touch and it actually getting registered - which is making it that much more difficult for the user to know they have pressed a button.</p>\n\n<p>I can safely say, the buttons are plenty big - in fact probably larger than what the iOS guidelines would be (again this is a web app - it isn't written in Objective-C, rather PHP and jQuery).  All the action is happening in the web app - which is accessed using a simple UIWebView iOS app that simply connects to the site.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, there are 2 problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Touch not registering at all - clients press progressively harder in frustration</li>\n<li>For touch events that are registered, there is a lag</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks to some suggestions in the comments below, which eventually led me to this <a href=\"http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-remove-the-300ms-delay-when-clicking-on-a-link-in-jquery-mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>, I was able to greatly improve the responsiveness of the web app.  But I know my code could still be improved.  My app uses a combination of backbone.js and jquery outside of any of the backbone mvc.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a jquery event I altered to prevent the default touchend behavior (it originally was a click event).</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('body').on( 'touchend', '#s-id', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    $('form[name=client-login]').submit();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And an example of a backbone view, which also originally used a click event</p>\n\n<pre><code>        var CounterView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n        el: \"body\",\n\n        events: {\n            \"touchend #b-q-prev\": \"qPrev\",\n            \"touchend #b-q-next\": \"qNext\"\n        },\n\n        qNext: function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();                 \n            this.model.qIncrease();\n            this.qShow();\n        },\n\n        qPrev: function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();                         \n            this.model.qDecrease();\n            this.qShow();\n        },...etc...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Implementing these techniques solved both my problems, as the app essentially doesn't care what you do after you originally touch a button, once you release it considers the original button you touched was pressed.  This allows the haphazard taps my clients use to trigger the events.  It also is way faster, solving issue 2.</p>\n\n<p>I am not confident I have implemented this correctly.  One major downside is now that when I do testing with a non-touch device, no events register because I removed all click events from the java script.  Should I be looking at multiple events, not just blocking the default touch end?  Based on the research I did, there is no clear solution to this - as jquery mobile hasn't event implemented it yet?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ipad","uiwebview","youtube","orientation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":190,"score":0,"question_id":10738710,"title":"Resize youtube video in web view on orientation change","body":"<p>I have a web view that doesn't take up the full screen.

The drawing works great, my only problem is saving. </p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)saveImageFromGLView:(UIView *)glView {\n\n    if(glCheckFramebufferStatusOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES) != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE_OES)\n        {\n            /// This IS being activated with code 0\n            NSLog(@\"failed to make complete framebuffer object %x\", glCheckFramebufferStatusOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES));\n    }\n\n\n    int s = 1;\n    UIScreen* screen = [ UIScreen mainScreen ];\n    if ( [ screen respondsToSelector:@selector(scale) ] )\n        s = (int) [ screen scale ];\n\n    const int w = self.frame.size.width;\n    const int h = self.frame.size.height;\n    const NSInteger myDataLength = w * h * 4 * s * s;\n    // allocate array and read pixels into it.\n    GLubyte *buffer = (GLubyte *) malloc(myDataLength);\n    glReadPixels(0, 0, w*s, h*s, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, buffer);\n    // gl renders \"upside down\" so swap top to bottom into new array.\n    // there's gotta be a better way, but this works.\n    GLubyte *buffer2 = (GLubyte *) malloc(myDataLength);\n    for(int y = 0; y &lt; h*s; y++)\n    {\n        memcpy( buffer2 + (h*s - 1 - y) * w * 4 * s, buffer + (y * 4 * w * s), w * 4 * s );\n    }\n    free(buffer); // work with the flipped buffer, so get rid of the original one.\n\n    // make data provider with data.\n    CGDataProviderRef provider = CGDataProviderCreateWithData(NULL, buffer2, myDataLength, NULL);\n    // prep the ingredients\n    int bitsPerComponent = 8;\n    int bitsPerPixel = 32;\n    int bytesPerRow = 4 * w * s;\n    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpaceRef = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();\n    CGBitmapInfo bitmapInfo = kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault;\n    CGColorRenderingIntent renderingIntent = kCGRenderingIntentDefault;\n    // make the cgimage\n    CGImageRef imageRef = CGImageCreate(w*s, h*s, bitsPerComponent, bitsPerPixel, bytesPerRow, colorSpaceRef, bitmapInfo, provider, NULL, NO, renderingIntent);\n    // then make the uiimage from that\n    UIImage *myImage = [ UIImage imageWithCGImage:imageRef scale:s orientation:UIImageOrientationUp ];\n    UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum( myImage, nil, nil, nil );\n    CGImageRelease( imageRef );\n    CGDataProviderRelease(provider);\n    CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpaceRef);\n    free(buffer2);    \n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Adding the above code to the Sample app works fine, the problem is doing it in my new app. The only difference I can tell is that I have not included PaintingWindow - would that be the problem? </p>\n\n<p>It's as if the saveImage method isn't seeing the data for drawings.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","pdf","download"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":85,"score":0,"question_id":12915799,"title":"iOS: PDF Download","body":"<p>I am developing an iPhone application, and I need to download or view a PDF\".

But when I create div like that: <code>$('&lt;div ...&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')</code> then binded touch events wont work. Same behaviour are on iPad and Android devices.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a code to reproduce an issue:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"libs/jquery-1.7.2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"JavaScript\"&gt;\n        $(function() {\n            $('#a').bind('touchstart', function(e) { alert('It works!'); });\n\n            var b = $('&lt;div style=\"width:100px; height:100px; background-color:red;\" id=\"b\" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;');\n            b.bind('touchstart', function(e) { alert('Does not work :-('); });\n            $('body').append(b);\n        });\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div style=\"width:100px; height:100px; background-color:green;\" id=\"a\" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;​\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example at jsfiddle: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/EqJDA/11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/EqJDA/11/</a></p>\n\n<p>I was searching around and noticed that if you bind any mouse event and touch event on same element then touch event will be ignored. I've thought that jQuery added some hidden mouse events and listed all them for the div \"b\" but there was only one touch event.</p>\n\n<p><em>UPDATE:</em> if events binded after element appended to DOM - everythig works good. But I cant predict when element will be appended to DOM and must construct it and add events before it happens.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone know why this happens? Is there any workarounds?\nThanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","ipad","iphone-sdk-4.0","ios-simulator"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1790,"score":5,"question_id":6140051,"title":"How to resize the iPhone/iPad Simulator?","body":"<p>The iPad-simulator is really small (like one third the size of the real iPad screen) on my 23\" Full-HD screen (and also on the 15\" MacBook Pro).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to resize it?</p>\n\n<p>I know it must maintain size and dpi-ratio to prevent sub-pixels, but I can hardly see anything withoout a magnifier.</p>\n"}]}
