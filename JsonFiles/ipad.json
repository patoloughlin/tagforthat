It's a tab bar application for iPad set up in Xcode.  I added a tab bar item to the navigation bar in one of the view controllers.  When that button is pressed, the controller presents a popover that contains a navigation controller that has a very simple <code>UITableViewController</code> subclass, called <code>TestContentViewController</code>, as its root view controller.</p>\n\n<p>In <code>viewDidLoad</code> of that subclass, I randomly generate a number of items:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.numItems = arc4random() % 10 + 3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my number of rows; number of sections is 1.  In <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> I just set the cell's label text and return it.  When a row is selected, I generate another instance of the same class and push it on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Without doing anything at all with the <code>contentSizeForViewInPopover</code> property on any VC, the popover just goes to its maximum height and stays there no matter how many rows are in my table view.</p>\n\n<p>If I set the size in viewDidAppear, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, self.numItems * 44);\n  [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n{\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it flashes very quickly to full height and then snaps to the height I set.</li>\n<li>When a new controller is pushed on the navigation controller, it snaps to its height with no animation.</li>\n<li>When I navigate back, if the VC that I'm popping to is taller than the one I'm popping from, it animates to the correct size.  If what I'm popping to is smaller, it does nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I do the same thing but in <code>viewWillAppear</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the popover first appears, it's full-height</li>\n<li>When I first tap a row and get a new controller on the stack, it animates to a minimum of about 400px tall.  When a new controller is pushed on the stack, if it needs more height it gets it.

I think the size I set there needs to take into account the extra height of the navigation bar built into the top of the popover.

I have a iPhone App that I have been updating for over a year and it has been working just fine on my iPad2, iPhone 3GS, as well as the 4G, 4GS, and 5. However, just recently I obtained an iPad3 to test the App on. Something very strange happens: When the App is loaded through Xcode in development it comes up and looks perfect - however, <strong>it won't respond to any touches at all</strong>. I have an alert that pops up on load and you can close that, but the actual main view controller will not react to any drag or touch gestures - it is essentially frozen. However! <strong>When I rotate the device and the App rotates correctly, it suddenly starts working just fine,</strong> even if I rotate it back! The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal.

This is the intended behavior.  </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're on element 1 of the pickerView.  If you scroll to element 0 (by dragging the component downwards)...and go past it (dragging the 0 element far down the picker view beyond the blue selection box)...when you let go, the pickerView will scroll back to element 0 in order to center it back in the blue selection box, and then call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we take the same example...(ie you're on element 1 of the pickerView, and scroll far beyond element 0)...if the pickerView is in the middle of scrolling back to element 0, and you quickly click element 0 or the white space above it, then the pickerView will awkwardly \"jump\" from wherever it is in the scroll animation straight to element 0, and then WON'T call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big issue, as we are now on element 0 without actually calling didSelectRow...thus, we have no indication that we are no longer on element 1.

The app. has a \"+\" and a \"-\" button for zooming in-and-out in user-defined increments (it is an app. for the visually impaired).</p>\n\n<p>This +/- zoom-button functionality previously worked 100% fine when my app. used a UIImageView inside of a UIScrollView (instead of the WebView). The ImageView was the actual view which was zoomed, and the CenterPoint was calculated for the ScrollView's zoomToRect method.</p>\n\n<p>I now have a WebView, which I know contains a ScrollView as a subview. I tried adapting the code which previously worked with the ImageView/ScrollView combo to instead zoom the WebView's ScrollView, <strong>but it is no longer calculating the CenterPoint correctly for zoomToRect:</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The WebView zooms correctly in-terms of the zoom-level, but the center point is always wrong. For some reason, the screen always zooms-in on the top-left every time.</p>\n\n<p>Another odd problem, is that after the very first time you zoom-in, you cannot scroll in the WebView past the visible portion of the screen. If you try to, it shows a bit of the content past the bounds of the currently visible area, but it instantly snaps-back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to zoom the UIWebView's ScrollView. </p>\n\n<p>I create a pointer to the ScrollView, and set \"self\" as its delegate. I then setup various variables, such as scrSize (the size of the view to zoom) and ZoomHandler (explained below):</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {\n  // ... Various UIWebView setup ...    \n  [self LoadURL];\n\n  // Zooming &amp; scrollview setup\n  zoomHandler = [[ZoomHandler alloc] initWithZoomLevel: ZOOM_STEP];\n  scrSize = CGPointMake(self.WebView.frame.size.width, self.WebView.frame.size.height);\n\n  scrollView = [WebView.subviews objectAtIndex:0];\n  [scrollView setTag:ZOOM_VIEW_TAG];\n  [scrollView setMinimumZoomScale:MINIMUM_SCALE];\n  [scrollView setZoomScale:1];\n  [scrollView setMaximumZoomScale:10];\n  scrollView.bounces = FALSE;\n  scrollView.bouncesZoom = FALSE;\n  scrollView.clipsToBounds = NO;\n  [scrollView setDelegate:self];\n\n  [super viewDidLoad];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To override the WebView's default zooming limitations, I inject this Javascript into the loaded webpage in the webViewDidFinishLoad: method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function increaseMaxZoomFactor() {\n  var element = document.createElement('meta');\n  element.name = \"viewport\";\n  element.content = \"maximum-scale=10 minimum-scale=1 initial-scale=1 user-scalable=yes width=device-width height=device-height;\"\n  var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n  head.appendChild(element);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>CenterPoint Code:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This code is used to calculate the CenterPoint to pass into zoomToRect:.

And since I've been assigning it in viewWillAppear, and viewWillAppear gets called every time you change tabs, I was just wondering if there were some unwanted effects.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","uitextfield"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":227,"score":1,"question_id":12916097,"title":"UITextField will not accept input from the keyboard for IOS6","body":"<p>I have narrowed this down to only IOS6 devices. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have searched everywhere and tried everything and I simply cannot figure this out!</p>\n\n<p>I have a <code>UITextField</code>.

I saw some mention of it maybe 6 months ago that it was being looked at or worked on but I would like to find out if this is still an issue, if it will be addressed or how I could get round it. It would be great to see this working on all operating systems. I also noticed my generated code uses the videoseries?list parameter when previously all I have read about is playlist. I assume this is HTML5 related ? Any help or advice would be great please.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","ios5","sdk"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":108,"score":0,"question_id":13052766,"title":"Mac OS X Lion can't install SDK and xCode","body":"<p>I would like to begin coding for iPhone and iPad so I installed <code>Mac OS X Lion</code> on <code>VMWare</code>.

When the application launches the device actively becomes a client searching for servers who are broadcasting files. When the client sees a server it adds a badge to its tab and adds an entry to it's table.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I am having is the GKSession only allows for one string to be transmitted before the connection is established -The peer Display Name. What I would like to transmit is the file name, number of pages and maybe a thumbnail.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can currently think of to achieve this behaviour is to automatically connect the client and servers, exchange the file information and then automatically disconnect them. This may work well if there is only one or two files currently broadcasting, there is likely to be threading/synchronisation issues when lots of different devices are broadcasting.</p>\n\n<p>For example 7 files may be available. So the client would have to connect to them one by one in order to receive information for all the files. This is likely to take a fair amount of time and the user may have already decided that they wish to download 'file 1'. By tapping 'file 1' a connection should be made and the transfer should begin. This may not be able to happen instantly if the client is busy retrieving information about the other available files. </p>\n\n<p>I have also read some issues with connecting to a server again shortly after disconnecting from it..

Clicking to a second tab / back again causes the content to appear as if the page doesn't draw off-screen content. After this, if I then scroll back up to the top of the page the content isn't drawn for the start of the page (which was previously visible). Scrolling the page up and down a few times with a <em>two-finger</em> scroll resolves the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I had read <a href=\"http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/new-mobile-safari-stuff-in-ios5-position-fixed-overflow-scroll-new-input-type-support-web-workers-ecmascript-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"this article\">this article</a> that stated that the problem was fixed. But it doesn't seem to be fully fixed; and still doesn't get around the issue that because you have to wrap your iframe in a div and put scrollbars on that div, desktop browsers <em>may</em> show a double scrollbar depending on how they interpret <code>overflow:auto</code>.</p>\n\n<p>p.s.

The concept for the app is drawing the shapes you see in the clouds. After downloading the app, upon launching <strong>CloudWriter</strong>, the user would be presented with a live video background (from the rear camera), with an OpenGL drawing layer on-top of that. A user would be able to open the app, point the iPad at clouds in the sky and draw what they see on the display. </p>\n\n<p>A major feature of the application is for the user to record a video screen capture of what happens on the display during a session. The live video feed and the \"drawing\" view will become a flat (merged) video. </p>\n\n<p>Some assumptions and background info about how this currently works.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using Apples AVCamCaptureManager, part of the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">AVCam</a> sample project, as a foundation for much of the camera related code. </li>\n<li>Init the AVCamCapture session using <strong>AVCaptureSessionPresetMedium</strong> as the preset.</li>\n<li>Begin to pipe the Camera feed out as a background via the videoPreviewLayer.</li>\n<li>Overlay that live videoPreviewLayer with a view that allows \"drawing\" (finger-paint style) using openGL. The \"drawing\" view background is [UIColor clearColor].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, the idea is that a user could point the iPad3 camera towards some clouds in the sky and draw the shapes they see. This functionality works flawlessly. I begin to run into performance problems when I attempt to make a \"flat\" video screen capture of the users session. The resulting \"flat\" video would have the camera input overlaid in real time with the users drawing's. </p>\n\n<p>A good example of an app that has functionality similar to what we are looking for is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/board-cam-standard-live-exhibitions/id443410754?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Board Cam</a>, available in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>To initiate the process, there is a \"record\" button visible in the view at all times.

Again, capturing full screen, i'm not sure <strong>drawInRect</strong> can provide nearly as much benefit.</p>\n\n<p>To improve performance, I'm thinking that if I were to scale down the image that <strong>imageFromSampleBuffer</strong> provides and the current context of the drawing view, I would see an increase in frame rate.

Pretty much all of our clients are having problems using the touchscreen.  They are pounding on the buttons and the app is not registering a touch.</p>\n\n<p>I had never thought there would be so much difficulty for a user to interact with the touch screen.  I am wondering if there is anything I can do as a developer to make this more user friendly.  There is a slight lag between the touch and it actually getting registered - which is making it that much more difficult for the user to know they have pressed a button.</p>\n\n<p>I can safely say, the buttons are plenty big - in fact probably larger than what the iOS guidelines would be (again this is a web app - it isn't written in Objective-C, rather PHP and jQuery).  All the action is happening in the web app - which is accessed using a simple UIWebView iOS app that simply connects to the site.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, there are 2 problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Touch not registering at all - clients press progressively harder in frustration</li>\n<li>For touch events that are registered, there is a lag</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks to some suggestions in the comments below, which eventually led me to this <a href=\"http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-remove-the-300ms-delay-when-clicking-on-a-link-in-jquery-mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>, I was able to greatly improve the responsiveness of the web app.  But I know my code could still be improved.  My app uses a combination of backbone.js and jquery outside of any of the backbone mvc.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a jquery event I altered to prevent the default touchend behavior (it originally was a click event).</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('body').on( 'touchend', '#s-id', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    $('form[name=client-login]').submit();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And an example of a backbone view, which also originally used a click event</p>\n\n<pre><code>        var CounterView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n        el: \"body\",\n\n        events: {\n            \"touchend #b-q-prev\": \"qPrev\",\n            \"touchend #b-q-next\": \"qNext\"\n        },\n\n        qNext: function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();                 \n            this.model.qIncrease();\n            this.qShow();\n        },\n\n        qPrev: function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();                         \n            this.model.qDecrease();\n            this.qShow();\n        },...etc...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Implementing these techniques solved both my problems, as the app essentially doesn't care what you do after you originally touch a button, once you release it considers the original button you touched was pressed.  This allows the haphazard taps my clients use to trigger the events.  It also is way faster, solving issue 2.</p>\n\n<p>I am not confident I have implemented this correctly.  One major downside is now that when I do testing with a non-touch device, no events register because I removed all click events from the java script.  Should I be looking at multiple events, not just blocking the default touch end?  Based on the research I did, there is no clear solution to this - as jquery mobile hasn't event implemented it yet?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ipad","uiwebview","youtube","orientation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":190,"score":0,"question_id":10738710,"title":"Resize youtube video in web view on orientation change","body":"<p>I have a web view that doesn't take up the full screen.

I'm running into a problem wherein large scroll areas cause the elements that are offscreen to appear after a delay when I scroll down to them.</p>\n\n<p>What I mean by that is, if I have a row of images (or even a div with a gradient) that is offscreen, when I scroll down (or up) to it, the <strong>expected behavior</strong> is for the element to appear on screen as I am scrolling to it.</p>\n\n<p>However, what I'm seeing is that the element <strong>does not appear</strong> until I lift my finger off the screen and the scroller finishes all its animations.</p>\n\n<p>This is causing a super noticeable problem for me, making the whole thing look choppy, although it is not. I'm guessing the iPad Safari is trying to do something to save memory. Is there any way in which I can prevent this choppy-ness from happening.

The answer I've selected helped me get to the complete solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To the one who answered my question, thank you!\nYour answer and the article you linked out to gave me a lead to try something with CSS.</p>\n\n<p>So, I was using translate3d before. It produced unwanted results. Basically, it would chop off and NOT RENDER elements that were offscreen, until I interacted with them. So, basically, in landscape orientation, half of my site that was offscreen was not being shown. This is a iPad web app, owing to which I was in a fix.</p>\n\n<p>Applying translate3d to relatively positioned elements solved the problem for those elements, but other elements stopped rendering, once offscreen. The elements that I couldn't interact with (artwork) would never render again, unless I reloaded the page.</p>\n\n<p>The complete solution:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*:not(html) {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, although this might not be the most \"efficient\" solution, it was the only one that works. Mobile Safari does not render the elements that are offscreen, or sometimes renders erratically, when using <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code>. Unless a translate3d is applied to all other elements that might go offscreen owing to that scroll, those elements will be chopped off after scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>So, thanks again, and hope this helps some other lost soul. This surely helped big time!</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","ipad","calendar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":328,"score":3,"question_id":7120621,"title":"Does any library exist for showing the week view like the one in ipad?","body":"<p>I have checked the Tapku and Kal libraries for calendar.

Usually the serverside framework shouldn't even play a role in this but somehow it does. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, hopefully someone here can help me out. Please keep in mind that my project is very much a prototype and that what I describe is simplified / reduced to the relevant parts. I would very much appreciate it if people didn't respond with the obligatory \"you want to do the wrong thing\" or security/performance nitpicks that aren't relevant to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>So here it goes:</p>\n\n<h1>Setup</h1>\n\n<p>I have a video taken from the Apple HTML5 showcase so I know that format isn't an issue. I have a simple tml page \"Play\" that just contains a \"video\" tag. </p>\n\n<h1>Problem</h1>\n\n<p>I started by implementing a RequestFilter that handles the request from the video control by opening the referenced video file and streaming it to client. That's basic \"if path starts with 'file' then copy file inputstream to response outputstream\". This works very well with Chrome but not with the Ipad. Fine, I though, must be some headers I'm missing so I looked at the Apple Showcase again and included the same headers and content type but no joy.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I though, well, let's see what happens if I let t5 serve the file. I copied the video to the webapp context, disabled my request filter and put the simple filename in the video's src attribute. This works in Chrome AND IPad.\nThat surprised me and prompted me to look at how T5 handles static files / context request. Thus far I've only gotten so far as to feel like there are two different paths which I've confirmed by switching out the hardwired \"video src\" to an Asset with a @Path(\"context:\"). This, again, works on Chrome but not on IPad. </p>\n\n<p>So I'm really lost here. What's this secret juice in the \"simple context\" requests that allow it to work on the IPad? There is nothing special going on and yet it's the only way this works. Problem is, I can't really serve those vids from my webapp context ...</p>\n\n<h1>Solution</h1>\n\n<p>So, it turns out that there is this http header called \"Range\" and that the IPad, unlike Chrome uses it with video. The \"secret sauce\" then is that the servlet handler for static resource request know how to deal with range requests while T5's doesn't. Here is my custom implementation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        OutputStream os = response.getOutputStream(\"video/mp4\");\n        InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream( new FileInputStream(f));\n        try {\n            String range = request.getHeader(\"Range\");\n            if( range != null &amp;&amp; !range.equals(\"bytes=0-\")) {\n                logger.info(\"Range response _______________________\");\n                String[] ranges = range.split(\"=\")[1].split(\"-\");\n                int from = Integer.parseInt(ranges[0]);\n                int to = Integer.parseInt(ranges[1]);\n                int len = to - from + 1 ;\n\n                response.setStatus(206);\n                response.setHeader(\"Accept-Ranges\", \"bytes\");\n                String responseRange = String.format(\"bytes %d-%d/%d\", from, to, f.length());\n                logger.info(\"Content-Range:\" + responseRange);\n                response.setHeader(\"Connection\", \"close\");\n                response.setHeader(\"Content-Range\", responseRange);\n                response.setDateHeader(\"Last-Modified\", new Date().getTime());\n                response.setContentLength(len);\n                logger.info(\"length:\" + len);\n\n                byte[] buf = new byte[4096];\n                is.skip(from);\n                while( len != 0) {\n\n                    int read = is.read(buf, 0, len &gt;= buf.length ? buf.length : len);\n                    if( read != -1) {\n                        os.write(buf, 0, read);\n                        len -= read;\n                    }\n                }\n\n\n            } else {\n                    response.setStatus(200);\n                    IOUtils.copy(is, os);\n            }\n\n        } finally {\n            os.close();\n            is.close();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","ipad","uiwebview"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":72,"score":-2,"question_id":12812969,"title":"iOS UIWebView load xml","body":"<p>I have an App Store review pages of XML address (<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/customerreviews/id=350962117/sortBy=mostRecent/xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/customerreviews/id=350962117/sortBy=mostRecent/xml</a>).

What happens is that, on occasion, the that <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags set up as hyperlinks that do postbacks via JavaScript will suddenly stop working and don't appear to do anything if you touch them on the screen.  These include an <strong>asp:LinkButton</strong> control that is set up as a logout link, and the <strong>header row of a GridView</strong> that is set up to allowing row sorting.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind it - they will work as normal for awhile, then stop, and I'll later notice that they start working again (mostly after closing Safari and re-opening it, though that doesn't always seem to work).</p>\n\n<p>The logout control looks like this in the aspx file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;asp:LinkButton ID=\"LogoutButton\" onclick=\"LogoutButton_Click\" runat=\"server\"&gt;[ Logout ]&lt;/asp:LinkButton&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and appears as this in the resulting HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a id=\"LogoutButton\" href=\"javascript:__doPostBack(&amp;#39;ctl00$LogoutButton&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&amp;#39;)\"&gt;[ Logout ]&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything special about Safari running on the iPad that might prevent such links to break on occasion</strong>, such as too much data loaded on the page or in other open browser tabs, or maybe something with the ViewState that is acting up in this scenario?  Even after playing around with the web application on the iPad for awhile, I can't find any particular way to recreate the problem, so I can't even begin to try to fix it which is really frustrating, so I'm looking for guidance from those who have developed ASP.NET apps and know the iPad and/or Safari environments really well.  I've never had this problem occur on a desktop browser.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Using the trick outlined on <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/30/view-source-safari-ipad-iphone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> about how to add a pseudo-View Source option to Safari on the iPad, I have now been able to see the difference in the generated HTML of a page where the postback links are working, and a page where it's stopped.  In short, the <strong>__doPostBack</strong> JavaScript function that ASP.NET normally imbeds in the page... simply stops getting imbedded for some reason.  As a result, the JavaScript tied to the links simply error out.  Here's what ASP.NET normally adds to the page to get the postback links working:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n//&lt;![CDATA[\nvar theForm = document.forms['form1'];\nif (!theForm) {\n    theForm = document.form1;\n}\nfunction __doPostBack(eventTarget, eventArgument) {\n    if (!theForm.onsubmit || (theForm.onsubmit() != false)) {\n        theForm.__EVENTTARGET.value = eventTarget;\n        theForm.__EVENTARGUMENT.value = eventArgument;\n        theForm.submit();\n    }\n}\n//]]&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This appears to be the same issue described on the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3817802?start=0&amp;tstart=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple support forum</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/917688/asp-net-not-generating-javascript-for-some-user-agents\">here on SO</a>.  The latter suggests that ASP.NET may sometimes be failing to recognize Safari on the iPad as being JavaScript capable and thus doesn't properly insert the <strong>__doPostBack</strong> function into the page.

I have gone through a couple of tutorials and know the basics, but currently I am stuck on how to proceed further. I am planning to create an app for basic home automation (i.e. switching lights, measuring temperature etc.). The backend is all set, so this is just about the frontend. This is what I am planning to do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The main view of the app should display a floor plan or the layout of the house</li>\n<li>On this floor plan you should be able to add lights/sensors/etc. - lets say objects to keep it generic</li>\n<li>These objects should be draggable so that you can arrange them on the floor plan according to where they really are (physically) - ideally this drag mode is toggable similar to rearranging icons on the home screen</li>\n<li>Each object should have a popover view (i.e. to set the dimmer intensity, switch lights etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know there is a lot of work to do, but I don't really know how to set this up. Current alternatives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a custom UIView subclass that contains all the logic an do the drawing in custom code, i.e. the dragging, the popover positioning etc. - but I have the feeling that I wouldn't really be leveraging the iOS framework capabilities</li>\n<li>Display the floor plan as an UIImageView and one UIButton for each object. This has the advantage that I can use StoryBoard to do the layouting and wiring (i.e. create segues for popovers etc.) - but I simply can't figure out how to do this with a variable number of buttons (since I don't know in advance how many buttons there will be). Is there some way to create these buttons in code?</li>\n<li>Use a custom UITableView. I have seen a couple of examples where they seem to use table views even if the layout has nothing to do with tables (like in my example) but I haven't found any tutorials that explain this concept in more detail</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or am I totally on the wrong track?

Once I have come up with a complete solution I will post it here.

I'm trying to implement this in a way that when I push an instance of MySplitViewController onto the nav stack, I get a table view (master) on the left and a detail view on the left.  However, when I run my code, the entire split view is filled with the table view.  How can I manually create a Split View layout?

It's worth noting why I'm not using the UISplitViewController.  My app is currently designed so that the root view is not split view.  The root view of my app will cause a split view to be pushed on to the nav stack.  The problem with this is that the UISplitViewController is designed to be the root view of an app and Apple's docs specifically say that if you use a UISplitViewController that it needs to be the root view.  Therefor, I'm implementing my own split view and manually managing the views.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ipad","opengl-es","ios6","eaglview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":12799133,"title":"Blank image is coming when I try to get image from EAGLView using snapshot method","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12528365/why-is-glreadpixels-failing-in-this-code-in-ios-6-0\">Why is glReadPixels() failing in this code in iOS 6.0?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Blank image is coming when I try to get image from EAGLView using snapshot method in iOS 6.

This is roughly what happens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Samsung Galaxy SII:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP GET request for file comes, asking for byte range <code>[0; &lt;almost the end of the file&gt;]</code></li>\n<li>server responds, starts to stream the file</li>\n<li><p>each subsequent chunk is served within the bounds of the <strong>same HTTP response</strong>. No new HTTP request is sent (unless the video is fast forwarded to a certain position). Streaming code chunk for this is quite simple, it reads <code>RandomAccessFile input</code> and writes to <code>OutputStream output</code> via <code>byte[] buffer</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ((read = input.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n    output.write(buffer, 0, read);\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>iPad 1\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP GET request for file comes, asking for byte range <code>[0; &lt;almost the end of the file&gt;]</code></li>\n<li>server responds, starts to stream the file</li>\n<li>iPad gets a chunk or two and then unilaterally decides to stop accepting bytes from the server and issues a <strong>separate <code>GET</code> request</strong> for the next chunk of the file. New range boundaries are e.g. <code>[100, almost the end of the file]</code>. The video is shown OK.</li>\n<li>cycle repeats again from step 2. Left boundary always moves towards the end of the file.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn't investigate how exactly the connection is terminated. It could be that iPad stops sending TCP ACK packets, I suppose this doesn't really matter that much.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that for every terminated connection I get <code>java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe</code> exception. This not only pollutes the logs (which is a minor/solvable problem) but I believe this can hurt performance as raising exceptions is quite expensive. When watching simple video, the exception rate was around 1 exception/sec, but if the server had 100 concurrent users, then the JVM would probably be spending loads of time just calculating stack traces instead of doing real work.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tested this on iPhone using iOS 6 and was able to observe the same behaviour as iPad 1.

If the current interface orientation is unknown, because the iPad e.g. is laying on a table, the <strong>LoginViewController</strong> orientation is <strong>LandscapeRight</strong> instead of the one in the <strong>HomeViewController</strong> (<strong>LandscapeLeft</strong>).\nIt works properly if holding the iPad in your hands, but otherwise precisely not. </p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on how to fix that issue? I did set my app orientation in the plist file (Landscape Left). I do implement shouldAutorotate with UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(...) in both - Home- and LoginViewController.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ipad","ios5","uiwebview","contenteditable"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":294,"score":1,"question_id":11520184,"title":"editable webView getting scrolled to top by itself","body":"<p>I have some text displayed in an editable webView.

I'm testing a web app for offline usage. The web app is no more than a static website with a cache manifest, so no special frameworks like sencha touch or tools like phnoegap are used. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript and a cache.manifest. </p>\n\n<p>The App worked fine before: I could save the website to the home screen. When I opened it from there, all the data would be downloaded for caching. At the end of the download the pop-up would come to ask if I wanted to increase the cache to 50MB – accepted – everything was fine – offline usage worked.</p>\n\n<p>Now after the update to iOS 6:\nI made some changes to the app. Deinstalled the app from home-screen. Opened it again in mobile safari. Saved to home screen. When opened the download starts as supposed to. But then it freezes at 99%. When I look it up in the console, I get the error-message:\n\"Application Cache update failed, because size quota was exceeded.\"</p>\n\n<p>And here comes the weird thing: When I open it in the browser, download starts and at the end I get asked if I want to increase cache size to 50MB. I confirm of course. When I now look in the preferences of safari at \"website data\", I see that all the cached data for this app is about 33MB!! So not at all more than 50MB! </p>\n\n<p>Is this a bug of iOS6? Did anyone experience any problems with caching data, when saving a website to the home-screen since the update to iOS 6? Thx for any help, as I am really stuck here... Couldn't find anything helpfull on the web...</p>\n\n<p>(Unfortunately I cannot post any link to the web app and/or it's files).</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found some more information on this issue:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nsbasic.com/blog/?p=928\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nsbasic.com/blog/?p=928</a> </p>\n\n<p>Apparently wep-apps saved to the home screen are treated now like native apps, meaning each instance of the same web-app saved to the home screen gets it's own \"storage sandbox\". So the data is independet from the data saved in mobile Safari. This means if you delete all of mobile safari's website-data this has no effect on the web app saved to the home screen (before ios6 they shared the same data). </p>\n\n<p>I also found this: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/12503815/1254555\">iOS 6 breaks GeoLocation in webapps (apple-mobile-web-app-capable)</a> </p>\n\n<p>Though not exactly the same topic, it could be related. Apparently web apps saved to the home screen using </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta content=\"yes\" name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>wont't be able to use geo-location. Geo-location only works when you remove this meta tag from your web app. Maybe this is also a workaround for the caching problem, I couldn't test it yet. But then again: Maybe the cache.manifest is no longer needed if the web apps saved to home screen are treated more like native apps? I will report back here if I find out more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ok after some testing and no useful hints from neither the web nor apple, I found out at least something: When I remove </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta content=\"yes\" name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>from the site everything of course works fine, because it's just like you open Safari and there I had no problem so far. So my interest is to make it work without the browser chrome. As described above the caching only goes to 99% and then I get the cache size quota exceeding error. Then I just closed the home screen app and opened it again. Now the caching downloads start again and complete just fine! No freezing, no error! And everything seems to be stored localy. I could only test it on the iPad simulator today but I hope I can confirm this as soon as I can get my hands on our device later.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems like instead of being asked if you want to increase the cache size you get the cache size quota exceeding error. Maybe because data storage for home screen apps now is handled differently you don't have to manualy increase the cache size anymore (which of course is pure speculation). Still, if this was the case, there should not be any error. So instead of being asked to increase cache size you have to open the home screen app twice, which is a pretty lame workaround btw...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I just could confirm this behaviour on a real device: saved to home screen -> opened from home screen -> download to be cached files -> cache size quota exceeding error at the end -> close home screen app (press home button) -> reopen it again -> to be cached files download again -> this time without error -> everthing usable offline. </p>\n\n<p>I also tested it on a device with iOS 5 and there it works like expected without errors. So this is definitely an iOS 6 issue.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone else confirm this behaviour or bug?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","ipad","delegation"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":809,"score":9,"question_id":10165141,"title":"jQuery .on() and .delegate() doesn't work on iPad","body":"<p>If you try this sample <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/8SEgW/11/embedded/result/\">fiddle</a> on PC, everything works.

you tap on a button a different controller is showed.</p>\n\n<p>I can't use any of the container controllers provided by the os due to some graphic constraints, so i decided to write my own container class conceptually similar to a UITabBarController. I would like to know if the method i use is correct, in particular the usage of addChildViewController: and didMoveToParentViewController:</p>\n\n<p>In the init of my container i do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MAHomeController *home = [[MAHomeController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"MAHomeController\" bundle:nil];\n        [self addChildViewController:home];\n        [home didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n        homeIndex = [self.childViewControllers indexOfObject:home];\n        [home release];\n\n        MAConfigHomeController *config = [[MAConfigHomeController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"MAConfigHomeController\" bundle:nil];\n        [self addChildViewController:config];\n        [config didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n        configIndex = [self.childViewControllers indexOfObject:config];\n        [config release];\n\n        MAViewerHomeController *viewer = [[MAViewerHomeController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"MAViewerHomeController\" bundle:nil];\n        [self addChildViewController:viewer];\n        [viewer didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n        viewerIndex = [self.childViewControllers indexOfObject:viewer];\n        [viewer release];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see i add all the content controllers at once, and call didMoveToParentViewController: immediately after adding them. Is this ok? </p>\n\n<p>Then the method that handles the navigation between the content does something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// some stuff removed for brevity, mostly configuration stuff\nUIViewController *fromCtrl = [self.childViewControllers objectAtIndex:currentIndex];\nUIViewController *toCtrl = [self.childViewControllers objectAtIndex:index];\nself.currentIndex = index;\n[self transitionFromViewController:fromCtrl toViewController:toCtrl duration:0.7 options:opts animations:^(void) {} completion:^(BOOL finished) {\n        if (completion)\n            completion();\n    }];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>as you can see in the completion block i don't call didMoveToParentViewController: on the newly transitioned controller, because it was added before to the childViewControllers of the container. And neither i remove the old controller because in fact it stays in the childViewCOntrollers array till the container controller is dealloced.</p>\n\n<p>All the events are routed correctly, even to child controllers nested inside the 3 main ones. Also memory should not be a problem, because with a simulated memory warning the views of the not-visible controllers are unloaded and reloaded when displayed. </p>\n\n<p>Is this design ok for you? </p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","ipad","avfoundation","ios6"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":107,"score":0,"question_id":12706851,"title":"Camera Preview does not fill screen","body":"<p>This is how I am setting up the camera preview in landscape mode in my iPad3</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>{</p>\n\n<pre><code>AVCaptureSession *session = [[AVCaptureSession alloc] init];\nsession.sessionPreset = AVCaptureSessionPreset640x480;\n\nCALayer *viewLayer = self.vImagePreview.layer;\n\nNSLog(@\"viewLayer = %@\", viewLayer);\n\nAVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer *captureVideoPreviewLayer = [[AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer alloc] initWithSession:session];\n\ncaptureVideoPreviewLayer.frame = self.vImagePreview.bounds;\n[self.vImagePreview.layer addSublayer:captureVideoPreviewLayer];\n\nAVCaptureDevice *device = [AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo];\n\nNSError *error = nil;\nAVCaptureDeviceInput *input = [AVCaptureDeviceInput deviceInputWithDevice:device error:&amp;error];\nif (!input) {\n    // Handle the error appropriately.\n    NSLog(@\"ERROR: trying to open camera: %@\", error);\n}\n[session addInput:input];\n\nstillImageOutput = [[AVCaptureStillImageOutput alloc] init];\nNSDictionary *outputSettings = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys: AVVideoCodecJPEG, AVVideoCodecKey, nil];\n[stillImageOutput setOutputSettings:outputSettings];\n\n[session addOutput:stillImageOutput];\n\n[session startRunning];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>In the storyboard, I set the view to fill the entire screen, however it ends up looking like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bcohw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>And furthermore, the image is also rotated 90º degrees.

My guess is that this is a really stupid error like missing an import or something but if anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that I followed the tutorials on how to set up the dataSource and delegate methods for the UIPickerView and I'm pretty sure they are fine however if you want to verify here you are: Thanks again.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"PopUpMenuViewController.h\"\n\n\n\n@implementation PopUpMenuViewController\n\n@synthesize menuType;\n@synthesize data;\n@synthesize popView;\n@synthesize menu;\n@synthesize customViewController;\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark UIPOPOVERCONTROLLER DELEGATE METHODS\n#pragma mark -\n\n- (BOOL)popoverControllerShouldDismissPopover:(UIPopoverController *)popoverController{\n\n //Delegate this too the User of this class\n return TRUE;\n}\n\n- (void)popoverControllerDidDismissPopover:(UIPopoverController *)popoverController{\n\n //Delegate this too the User of this class\n}\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark CUSTOM POPOVERVIEWCONTROLLER METHODS\n#pragma mark -\n\n-(void) initWithMenuType:(int)type{\n\n menuType = type;\n}\n\n-(id) initWithMenuType:(int)type andData:(NSMutableArray *)dataSet fromViewItem:(id)sender \n    withMainView:(UIView *)mView{\n\n [super init];\n menuType = type;\n data = dataSet;\n rootView = sender;\n displayView = mView;\n arrowDir = UIPopoverArrowDirectionUp;\n customViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"PopUpMenu\" bundle:nil];\n\n return self;\n}\n\n-(void) setPopUpArrowDirection:(UIPopoverArrowDirection) arrow{\n\n arrowDir = arrow; \n}\n\n\n-(void) showPopUp{ \n\n //UIPicker Menu\n if (menuType==1) {\n\n  //UIPicker Setup\n  menu = [[UIPickerView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,100,162,162)];\n  menu.delegate = self;\n  menu.dataSource = self;\n\n  [menu reloadAllComponents];\n  [menu selectRow:0 inComponent:0 animated:YES];\n\n  //Add the picker to the view\n  [customViewController.view addSubview:menu];\n\n  popView = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:customViewController] ;\n  [popView setDelegate:self];\n  CGRect pos = [rootView frame];\n  [popView presentPopoverFromRect:CGRectMake(pos.origin.x,pos.origin.y,0,pos.size.height) \n         inView:displayView permittedArrowDirections:arrowDir animated:YES];\n  //[popView setPopoverContentSize:CGSizeMake(menu.frame.size.width+5,menu.frame.size.height+5)];\n\n }\n\n\n}\n\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark VIEW CONTROLLER DELEGATE METHODS\n#pragma mark -\n\n// The designated initializer.

We're developing for the iPad and using Unity's \nApple plugin. Our game is a 2-D platform game that features gameplay that uses the rotation of the device (iPad). We're using physics for character movement.</p>\n\n<p>The game is played mostly in Landscape Right. We can change the orientation of the device easy enough using <code>Screen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeRight</code>, etc. We want to be able to rotate the device from either <code>LandscapeLeft</code> and <code>LandscapeRight</code> to either <code>Portrait</code> or <code>PortraitUpsideDown</code>, which we can do.</p>\n\n<p>When running our scene within Unity3d, when we rotate from Landscape to Portrait, our character falls because we rotate the world (what she's standing on), while she remains in the same orientation (physics remains the same), causing her to fall. This is the desired behavior we want. However, when we build to Xcode and run the game on the iPad simulator (version 5.1), and we rotate the device so that the world rotates, it merely rotates the device with the game still having the same orientation (landscape). The iPad is in portrait however the game is still in landscape. Are there other variables that we need to set within the device other that ScreenOrientation? How do we have our game state consistent with the device's orientation?</p>\n\n<p>A quick summary: we want our game to default to Landscape. When we rotate to portrait we want the world to rotate with the camera and the player remaining constant. Physics is tied with the character meaning once the world rotates, she falls because she's no longer standing on the ground. Currently when we rotate the iPad, the orientation of the device changes but the game's orientation doesn't change. We want the world to shift on rotation but the character remain constant. It works in Unity3d but doesn't work correctly using the Xcode iPad simulator. How do we do this?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Kenneth</p>\n"},{"tags":["ipad","sqlite","web-applications","cache-manifest","html5-appcache"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":99,"score":0,"question_id":12704029,"title":"Securing HTML5 AppCache and SQLite from deletion","body":"<p>I am developing a web application using HTML5 AppCache manifest for storing all the application artifacts (HTML pages, style sheets, scripts, etc.) and SQLite for storing forms data being submitted by the user.</p>\n\n<p>The concern is that both of these repositories get deleted by deleting browser data - main focus is SQLite as the data being stored there is really crucial, as compared to AppCache.
