I added a domain service to it with an entity model that has one entity. The client app simply loads all rows in the entity at startup. When I run this on my development box, it works as expected. However, when I move it to our test server I get an exception saying that the method I am calling cannot be found (Load operation failed for query 'GetCTCStation'. The remote server returned an error. NotFound.). When I inspected the client/server communication more closely with Fiddler I found out that the request is going to <strong><a href=\"http://%5Bserver\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://%5Bserver</a> url]/ClientBin/SilverlightApplication7-Client-Web-CTCService.svc/binary</strong>. \nI added the domain service to the root of the web project, so I don't understand why the client is looking for it in the ClientBin directory. It's obviously not there. What am I doing wrong here? I have never had any issues with July preview version of RIA.</p>\n\n<p><hr></p>\n\n<p>It is relative, but that is handled in the Generated_Code file automatically.

Is there some tool that can plug into a xaml application to validate bindings?</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","asynchronous","wcf-ria-services","ria",".net-4.5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":1,"question_id":13240990,"title":"Async Task with RIA Services","body":"<p>I´m using Silverlight wich talks to a .net 4.5 server with WCF RIA Services.</p>\n\n<p>I´m interested in using the new Async pattern to gain some performance boost on the server.

I never actually see the ChildWindow get displayed at all before this message comes up, however, it does go through the <code>.Closed</code> event before these errors occur.</p>\n\n<p>The child window currently has no code in it, just a few basic silverlight controls added (textblock, textboxes, etc.) </p>\n\n<p>The childwindow is instantiated like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public TickerAdminControl()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        winNewMsg = new windAddNewTickerMessage();\n        winNewMsg.Closed += new EventHandler(winNewMsg_Closed);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>.Closed</code> event looks like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>    void winNewMsg_Closed(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (winNewMsg.DialogResult == true)\n        {\n            TickerProxy.GetAllMessagesAsync();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It really couldn't be more basic, so I'm baffled by this error. The <code>.Show()</code> is called in a simple button click event on a UserControl.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This only occurs on IE. If I use Chrome, it works without changing any code. </p>\n\n<p>2nd EDIT: This appears to only happen when I am running in Debug from Visual Studio. If I pull up the site manually (Http://localhost:3881/Default.aspx) everything works fine, which is why it worked in Chrome. It also works in IE8 when I access it manually. I think I'm even more confused now.</p>\n\n<p>3rd EDIT: While everything appears to work fine when running in non-debug, the errors persist but allow the child window to display an operate properly.

My grid and chart are based on this demo example:  <a href=\"http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#Chart/Aggregates\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#Chart/Aggregates</a>.  Basically, the grid compiles data and summarizes by Year, Quarter, Month, and then some other categories as well.  For the Month column, I tried two different methods (for sorting purposes, I have to use an integer or some date value for the month).  First, I just made Month an integer field and then used a converter mapped in the xaml for the 'Month' field to display 'JAN', 'FEB', etc.  This worked fine for the grid, but the chart would display 1, 2, etc. instead of the month abbreviation.  I researched this and was not able to come up with a solution to map the converter to the chart.  So, I tried making the Month field a datetime and then set the value to 1/1/1900, 2/1/1900, etc. and specified the format of the field to 'MMM' in the xaml for the grid.  I then used the following statement to set the the format in the chart when the user grouped by month:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SalesAnalysisChart.DefaultView.ChartArea.AxisX.DefaultLabelFormat = \"MMM\"; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This partially worked in that when the months were displayed across the x-axis they were labeled properly, but not when they appeared in the legend (the user, of course, can group by any of the columns which may or may not include month).  I've tried setting LegendItemLabelFormat, ItemLabelFormat, etc. but without success.  I'm not sure of the element on which to set the property.  I only need to change the default format for just the Month column - all other columns should display normally when grouped.  I also came across a class called 'LegendItemFormatConverter' which looks promising but I can't find any examples as to how to implement it.  I would actually prefer the converter method because the converter I wrote displays the month abbreviation in all caps, whereas the 'MMM' format displays in upper/lower case.  Here is the converter code that I originally used for the grid:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System; \nusing System.Net; \nusing System.Windows; \nusing System.Windows.Controls; \nusing System.Windows.Documents; \nusing System.Windows.Ink; \nusing System.Windows.Input; \nusing System.Windows.Media; \nusing System.Windows.Media.Animation; \nusing System.Windows.Shapes; \nusing System.Windows.Data; \n\nnamespace ApolloSL \n{ \n    public class MonthConverter : IValueConverter \n    { \n        public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter,     System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) \n        { \n            if (value != null) \n            {  \n                DateTime date = new DateTime(1900, (Int32)value, 1); \n                return date.ToString(\"MMM\").ToUpper(); \n            } \n            else\n            { return \"\"; } \n        } \n\n        public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) \n        { \n            return value.ToString(); \n        } \n    } \n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please help...</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance,</p>\n\n<p>Bryan</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","runtime","winrt","portable-class-library"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":1,"question_id":13170024,"title":"How to determine .net platform at runtime from portable library?","body":"<p>Specifically I want to be able to determine at runtime when portable class library code is running on Silverlight, WinRT, or .NET</p>\n\n<p>My best idea right now is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typeof(object).Assembly.GetCustomAttribute&lt;AssemblyProductAttribute&gt;().Product\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On .NET it returns \"Microsoft® .NET Framework\" and on Silverlight it returns \"Microsoft® Silverlight\"  but I'm not sure if it distinguishes itself on WinRT as I'm not developing with Windows 8 at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>So I'd like to know if that works or any better ideas.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","slider","mediaelement"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":441,"score":1,"question_id":4717309,"title":"Silverlight MediaElement Position with generated WAV (performance)","body":"<p>I have tied a MediaElement control to a Slider control.<br />\nI am getting my stream from a binary field in a SQL Server database.<br />\nI am concerned that there may be some performance issues due to the following:<br />\n1.

The grid is being fed via the OData service and everything works smoothly (it could be pointed out that it doesn't really matter where the data comes from and what it represents, and it would be true of course), except for the Form Ribbon which doesn't \"switch\" like it does when one clicks a builtin navigation link for a related entity. I am thereby wondering how (<em>if?</em>) one can force the ribbon to show the commands for an arbitrary related entity, when a custom navigation link is used to show an HTML Web Resource ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","entity-framework","domainservices"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13120252,"title":"DbGeography + entity framework 5 + Silverlight + DomainService","body":"<p>I have create Entity with DbGeography and add it to my Domainservice.\nBut my SL app didn't see this filed.\nHow can I use DbGeography in SL5 app?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wcf","silverlight","silverlight-4.0","ria"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":2,"question_id":11211627,"title":"Silverlight 4 + RIA Service Loads","body":"<p>Is it an acceptable practice to use the same Load Operation to load multiple entities and then binding it to a single event handler asychronously?

So is there a way to stop them from leaving without having valid input?</p>\n\n<p>Thankyou</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool IsDigitsOnly(string str) {\n        foreach (char c in str) {\n            if (c &lt; '0' || c &gt; '9') {\n\n                return false;\n\n            }\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    protected Boolean noLetters() {\n\n\n\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(ReadySecTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            ReadySecTxtBox.Focus();\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RoundSecTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RestSecTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RelaxSecTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(ReadyMinTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RoundMinTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RestMinTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(RelaxMinTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (!IsDigitsOnly(NoRoundsTxtBox.Text)) {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"digits only\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        else return true;\n\n    }\n\n    protected Boolean validInputs(){\n\n\n        if (noLetters()) {\n\n\n            if (int.Parse(ReadySecTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(ReadySecTxtBox.Text) &gt; 59) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"seconds must be between 0 and 59\");\n\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RoundSecTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RoundSecTxtBox.Text) &gt; 59) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"seconds must be between 0 and 59\");\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RestSecTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RestSecTxtBox.Text) &gt; 59) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"seconds must be between 0 and 59\");\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RelaxSecTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RelaxSecTxtBox.Text) &gt; 59) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"seconds must be between 0 and 59\");\n                return false;\n            }\n\n            if (int.Parse(ReadyMinTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(ReadyMinTxtBox.Text) &gt; 99) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"minutes must be between 0 and 99\");\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RoundMinTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RoundMinTxtBox.Text) &gt; 99) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"minutes must be between 0 and 99\");\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RestMinTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RestMinTxtBox.Text) &gt; 99) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"minutes must be between 0 and 99\");\n                return false;\n            }\n            if (int.Parse(RelaxMinTxtBox.Text) &lt; 0 || int.Parse(RelaxMinTxtBox.Text) &gt; 99) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"minutes must be between 0 and 99\");\n                return false;\n            }\n\n            if (int.Parse(NoRoundsTxtBox.Text) &lt; 1 || int.Parse(NoRoundsTxtBox.Text) &gt; 99) {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"number of rounds must be between 1 and 99\");\n                return false;\n            }\n\n\n            else return true;\n        }\n        else return false;\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnManipulationStarted(ManipulationStartedEventArgs e) {\n\n        if (validInputs()) {\n\n\n            totalSec = (int.Parse(RoundSecTxtBox.Text) + int.Parse(RestSecTxtBox.Text)) * int.Parse(NoRoundsTxtBox.Text)\n                + int.Parse(RelaxSecTxtBox.Text) + int.Parse(ReadySecTxtBox.Text);\n            totalMin = (int.Parse(RoundMinTxtBox.Text) + int.Parse(RestMinTxtBox.Text)) * int.Parse(NoRoundsTxtBox.Text)\n                + int.Parse(RelaxMinTxtBox.Text) + int.Parse(ReadyMinTxtBox.Text);\n\n            TotalMinTxtBox.Text = totalMin.ToString(\"00\");\n            TotalSecTxtBox.Text = totalSec.ToString(\"00\");\n        }\n\n        base.OnManipulationStarted(e);\n\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":544,"score":0,"question_id":8282815,"title":"updating live tile image with background task image not showing","body":"<p>I'm having some major issues getting a live tile to update its image via background task, I have tried it from a web server and from local files stored in the background agent but with no luck.

Because the graphics engine is relatively simple, you get to spend your time building features into the game and it's possible for one person to quickly build something fun.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a typical screen might look something like this (the @ is the player, # is a wall, the other characters are things like monsters, stairs, and items):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thangorodrim.net/graphics/dumps/dump2.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm an experienced ASP.Net dev and I'm just getting started with Silverlight. Is there a particular approach I should take for this? </p>\n\n<p>To provide some background, in Winforms, most standard approaches are too slow  -- the text ends up updating with a visible, ugly blink. I'm thinking something to do with the Canvas might be appropriate, but even better would be to somehow draw a screen into a buffer and then instantly flip that onto the screen so that it becomes visible instantly. </p>\n\n<p>But I don't really want to mess around with DirectX right now - I'm hoping WPF can get me to where I need to be without a big learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n\n<p><b>Update:</b> So this turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried a lot of different approaches and I was finally able to get it to actually render fast enough, but I think that to make it blazing hot fast you should probably build a sprite map of the font you want to use and work from that instead of trying to use any of the built in font rendering stuff. I didn't do that.</p>\n\n<p>When I got the core rendering engine done, I ended up with some annoying artifacts related to quirks of font rendering (even fixed width fonts are sometimes a liiitle bit wide...), and when I finally worked that out I discovered <a href=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">libtcod</a>, which is a very impressive roguelike engine that has a C# wrapper. That's all console based. I played with it a little and I was blown away. </p>\n\n<p>As of 1.5.1, everything I've touched in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes (which I think they recently ditched), but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there, and that includes several line-of-sight, pathfinding, and even dungeon generation algorithms. It's pretty advanced visually. Have you ever seen an RL like this?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/files/screenshot0014.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, it's possible to build a roguelike with silverlight, but I wouldn't go in expecting it to be easy unless you've already got a strong silverlight or game dev background. You're going to be re-inventing some serious wheels, and even with a powerful toolkit that allows to focus on gameplay, there's no shortage of things to do.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","silverlight"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":630,"score":-3,"question_id":8785566,"title":"How to pass values from Silverlight (Xaml) application to Asp.net page","body":"<p>I am doing an application in Silverlight in which I should pass the values in xaml to asp.net page.</p>\n\n<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","silverlight","mvvm"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":13086595,"title":"Disabled button when textbox is empty in silverlight mvvm?","body":"<p>i'm working on silverlight with MVVM pattern. in design page i have three textbox and one button. here my requirement is if the 3 textbox is empty or null means the button is disabled.\nhow to achieve this.. any help..?</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","mvvm","shopping-cart"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13106452,"title":"Silverlight:How to pass objects between two viewmodels and display it on view?","body":"<p>I am implementing simple shopping cart example in silverlight using MVVM pattern. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Here I have one model class Product</li>\n<li>two views 1) homepage where user will search for product in a list view and add it to cart. 2) Cart page where I want to display selected product in a listview.</li>\n<li>two viewModels namely HomeViewModel  and CustomerCartViewModel respectively</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>HomeViewModel is given as static resource to the home page.

I'll omit that code for the time being unless requested. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","image-processing","graphics"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":1,"question_id":13093078,"title":"get tangent line on particular point of curve?","body":"<p>My Idea or Project:</p>\n\n<p>I want to develop an application which takes an image as input and returns another image as output.\nFor example: I have a bitmap image with a circle drawn inside it.

Using fiddler, e.g., the XML generated has a bunch of clutter that I don't really NEED just to populate this ComboBox.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of ONE record being brought back of type Employee.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>   ----------------------------- \n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?&gt;\n&lt;feed xml:base=\"http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/\" xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices\" xmlns:m=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"&gt;\n  &lt;title type=\"text\"&gt;Employees&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;id&gt;http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/Employees&lt;/id&gt;\n  &lt;updated&gt;2011-11-09T23:41:01Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"self\" title=\"Employees\" href=\"Employees\" /&gt;\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/Employees('54924')&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;title type=\"text\"&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;updated&gt;2011-11-09T23:41:01Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n    &lt;author&gt;\n      &lt;name /&gt;\n    &lt;/author&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"edit\" title=\"Employee\" href=\"Employees('54924')\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/EmployeeTypes\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"EmployeeTypes\" href=\"Employees('54924')/EmployeeTypes\" /&gt; \n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Locations\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Locations\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Locations\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Buildings\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Buildings\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Buildings\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Managers\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Managers\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Managers\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Assignments\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Assignments\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Assignments\" /&gt;\n    // ********************************************\n    // MANY MORE LINKS - REMOVED FOR BREVITY\n    // ********************************************        \n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/xxx\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"xxx\" href=\"Employees('54924')/xxx\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/yyy\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"yyy\" href=\"Employees('54924')/yyy\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/zzz\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"zzz\" href=\"Employees('54924')/zzz\" /&gt;\n    &lt;category term=\"xxx.HumanResources.Employee\" scheme=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/scheme\" /&gt;\n    &lt;content type=\"application/xml\"&gt;\n      &lt;m:properties&gt;\n        &lt;d:EmpNo m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;54924&lt;/d:EmpNo&gt;\n        &lt;d:FirstName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;John&lt;/d:FirstName&gt;\n        &lt;d:LastName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Hughes&lt;/d:LastName&gt;\n        &lt;d:MiddleName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Michael&lt;/d:MiddleName&gt;\n        &lt;d:Salary m:type=\"Edm.Decimal\"&gt;20000&lt;/d:Salary&gt;\n        &lt;d:Notes m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Anything...&lt;/d:Notes&gt;\n        &lt;d:PrimaryPhone m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;984-875-4545&lt;/d:PrimaryPhone&gt;\n        &lt;d:StartDate m:type=\"Edm.DateTime\"&gt;1977-02-01T00:00:00&lt;/d:StartDate&gt;\n        &lt;d:EndDate m:type=\"Edm.DateTime\"&gt;1995-12-31T00:00:00&lt;/d:EndDate&gt;\n        // ********************************************\n        // MANY MORE PROPERTIES - REMOVED FOR BREVITY\n        // ********************************************\n        &lt;d:AnotherFieldX m:type=\"Edm.Double\" m:null=\"true\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/m:properties&gt;\n    &lt;/content&gt;\n  &lt;/entry&gt;\n&lt;/feed&gt;\n\n-----------------------------\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, I don't need all that junk like those LINKS and this is just ONE entity.

But as soon as I do, my <code>GapPanel</code> crashes in its <code>MeasureOverride</code> method. But only when the <code>ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility</code> is set to <code>Auto</code>, <code>Visible</code> or <code>Hidden</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I think the ScrollViewer calls somewhere <code>child.Measure(availableSize)</code>, either. When the horizontal scroll bar is available, the available <em>horizontal</em> space isn't e.g. 1150, it's <code>double.PositiveInfinity</code>. Now I try to calculate the <code>availableSizeForChildren</code> in my <code>MeasureOverride</code> method and something like this happens:</p>\n\n<pre><code>double.PositiveInfinity - (double.PositiveInfinity - 1120) = not defined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if I call <code>child.Measure(sizeWithANotDefinedValue)</code> I get an exception.</p>\n\n<p>So how could I get around this? I really need this behaviour, which is implemented in code. Actually there is another custom panel wrapped around the scroll viewer. <em>A kind of <strong>hack</strong> works</em>: what we do is, we save the available space of the parent (custom) panel of the <code>ScrollViewer</code> in a static field (which hasn't any <code>double.PositiveInfinity</code> values). At the moment we access this value in the <code>MeasureOverride</code> method of the panel, which is actually contained in the <code>Children</code> of the <code>ScrollViewer</code>. This is really <strong>ugly</strong> and <strong>hacky</strong>, isn't it? Because actually we don't use the availableSpace the <code>ScrollViewer</code> offers, we just access a static variable, which might contain everything.</p>\n\n<p>I think the ugly thing about this is that there are dependencies between two different panels. I'd really like not doing this.</p>\n\n<p>Or is a <code>ScrollViewer</code> in general the wrong approach? If it is, how to get the panel scrollable without a <code>ScrollViewer</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","silverlight","xaml"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":13016932,"title":"How to create a style based on default style?","body":"<p>How to create a style based on default style in Silverlight?</p>\n\n<p>For example, in WPF we make it like:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;Style TargetType=\"{x:Type TextBox}\" BasedOn=\"{StaticResource {x:Type TextBox}}\"&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Margin\" Value=\"2\" /&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Padding\" Value=\"2\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":165,"score":2,"question_id":7245628,"title":"Update ValidationSummary after UpdateSource","body":"<p>I'm forcing an update of every textBox in a silverlight page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.txtName.GetBindingExpression(TextBox.TextProperty).UpdateSource();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works fine (the textbox shows its error, etc...) but ValidationSummary is not refreshed...</p>\n\n<p>Any idea??</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>After some tests I've realized it was because ValidationSummary wasn't loaded yet.

It flips the canvas upside down and lowers it 200 down to adjust to root canvas position. Given taht Logo looks ok when rendered means that all graphic elements in the xaml are actually upside down :). Maybe its an AI thing, I don't know. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that I now use Blend to convert this canvas into a GraphicBrush. The blend omits the transform and the logo looks upiside down when brush is applied. Rather then again transforming at each brush recipient I was thinking that maybe we should just fix it at the root, e.g. convert all paths so that they render properly to begin with avoiding a need for root transform.</p>\n\n<p>Question: is there a programmatic (or any other way) to do this? Meaning, can I render this canvas and then serialize a rendered (after all transforms applied) DOM into an XAML? </p>\n\n<p>Or to make  the question clearer: there are two transforms applied to each path (as seen above, one global flip and one local shift for each path), can I somehow apply those transforms to each path/its points so that paths render without them.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":321,"score":4,"question_id":10930642,"title":"RichTextBox maximum size limitation?","body":"<p>In my Windows Phone application I use RichTextBox to display a content.

However, if I shutdown and reload, the state code value doesn't bind from the entity to the UI and the combo shows nothing selected. Then, of course, a subsequent save nulls the entity's state value.</p>\n\n<p>I want this very simple since I want to display state codes and save state codes (I don't want to display the full state name). So I don't want to have to muck with creating a State class that has Code and FullName properties and avoid having to use the SelectedValuePath and DisplayMemberPath properties of the combobox.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nAdded to the code how ProjectModel does change notification. Note that the ProjectEntity class does this too. Trust me, it works. I've left it out because it also inherits from an Entity base class that does change notification through reflection. TwoWay binding works on everything but for the combobox.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","sharepoint","sharepoint2010","silverlight-5.0","sharepoint-clientobject"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":12907490,"title":"How to create a new document from a Document Template using Client Object Model","body":"<p>I require to create a programatically create a new document using the Document Template URL of the document Library and this requires to be done using the Client Object Model.

We had to be able to send post data to the page the ReportViewer is on so a little bit of javascript had to be added in to actually open the page.  </p>\n\n<p>Most of the info online talks about just adding the line ReportViewerCtrl.reset() and it should work but for me it makes absolutely no difference.  I'm fairly confident the code will explain the situation better but if you need more details about the set up, please, just ask.  </p>\n\n<p>So... from the beginning... the hyperlink button for the report calls this on click:  <code>HtmlPage.Window.Invoke(\"showAspPage\", par);</code></p>\n\n<p>That calls this script (I have cut out everything that handles the report parameters and stuff because it works just the same when that data is excluded anyway):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nvar g_htmlWindow;\n\nfunction showAspPage(param) {\n    var to = param[\"to\"];\n    var myForm = document.createElement(\"form\");\n    myForm.method = \"post\";\n    myForm.action = to;\n    myForm.setAttribute(\"target\", \"_blank\");  \n\n    //handle parameters here\n\n    document.body.appendChild(myForm);\n    myForm.submit();\n    document.body.removeChild(myForm);\n }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>param[\"to\"]</code> is the link to the page the actual <code>ReportViewer</code> control is on... so from the aspx portion of that page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n        &lt;asp:ScriptManager ID=\"ScriptManager1\" runat=\"server\"&gt; &lt;/asp:ScriptManager&gt;\n        &lt;rsweb:ReportViewer ID=\"ReportViewer4\" runat=\"server\"&gt; &lt;/rsweb:ReportViewer&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the important chunk from the aspx.cs portion of the <code>ReportViewer</code> page... (might be over-kill on setting properties and such but I've added a lot of stuff while trying out what suggestions I found on the web)</p>\n\n<pre><code>ReportViewer4.Reset();  \nReportViewer4.ShowCredentialPrompts = false;\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportServerCredentials = new ReportCredentials();\nReportViewer4.ProcessingMode = Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms.ProcessingMode.Remote;\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportServerUrl = reportServerURL\nReportViewer4.AsyncRendering = false;\n\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportPath = reportPath;\nReportViewer4.KeepSessionAlive = true; \n\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.SetParameters(params);\n\nReportViewer4.SizeToReportContent = true; \nReportViewer4.Width = Unit.Pixel(900);\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I only want to see one report, everything works fine - everything is set up correctly.  But, when I want to call <code>HtmlPage.Window.Invoke(\"showAspPage\", par);</code> twice in a row for two different reports I start getting this error either when one of the reports loads or when you try and change the report parameters in either of the two reports:  <strong>ASP.NET session has expired or could not be found</strong> Both reports load 95% of the time - with parameters, data, everything; one report always loads but it depends on which one finishes loading first; but you can't change the parameters without that error.</p>\n\n<p>So.... as a slight alternative, in this situation, the ability to change the report isn't actually needed and I could do a direct export to PDF but with scripting involved you can't simply add \"rs:Format=PDF\" to the end of the report path.  However, if the parameters are visible, they need to work if changed.  I guess I could hide the whole parameter section?  But it still doesn't solve the issue of getting the error when the report loads sometimes....</p>\n\n<p>Also.... might be entirely unrelated, but the parameters are encrypted and I have to get the salt and hash from the database (Entity Framework and WCF RIA Services) before I call HtmlPage.Window.Invoke.... I find this kind of weird.... but, after the report screen loads, if the user sits there and doesn't click on anything (but doesn't sit there long enough to actually be logged out, maybe just 5 min or so), I get this error:\n<strong>'Load operation failed for query 'GetStuff'. The remote server returned an error: Not Found.'</strong> but again, it works fine if clicked right away.

But in practice that isn't true at all: when I set a font height (and line height) of 22 with a common font like Lucida Sans Unicode, the actual height between lines is 33 pixels.  (Actually, 33 and a fraction.)</p>\n\n<p>To work around this, I tried doing what I had done in Java applets: use font metrics to ask how tall my text actually is.  The only way to do this that I found is to render the sample text into an offscreen TextBlock, Measure it, and see how tall it ends up.  It returned a very handy answer: 32 pixels.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this is ALMOST correct.  The onscreen TextBlock rendered the font 33 pixels high, and the offscreen one rendered it 32 pixels high.  The only way to measure my text accurately turned out to be to put the \"offscreen\" block onscreen, transparent and behind the real onscreen one.  Then the measurement returns 33.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?  Why does everybody say the height is in pixels, but I find that the number here represents an actual height measured in pixel-and-a-halfs, and furthermore the exact ratio varies depending on whether the control is part of the active page or is detached and self-sufficient?  What am I not understanding??</p>\n\n<p><em>Added note</em>: I am aware of the difference between the height occupied by a row of text and the height of the actual glyphs.  But the same documentation that says the font height is in pixels also says that the line height is in pixels, and defaults to being the same as the font height.  This clearly implies that the font height is supposed to include all vertical space used, not just the glyph heights.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Final note</em>: I think my problem in the end is that I keep running into misinformation about silverlight, and then forgetting where I read it, so I get it mixed up with the accurate information.  Like, where was it that I read that Canvas stretches to hold its content?  It doesn't.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","crystal-reports"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2894,"score":2,"question_id":5415782,"title":"Using Crystal reports with Silverlight 4","body":"<p>I am using Silverlight to design my web application and want to server up PDF reports to customers.

(Haven't tried IE10 yet.)</p>\n\n<p>In the IE9 case, the Silverlight object appears as expected, but the dropdown menu collapses as soon as the mouse touches the displayed Silverlight object.  I.e., the CSS3 menu loses sight of the mouse and the dropdown collapses the moment the mouse pointer touches the Silverlight object.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been able to find much in the way of help for this one.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or guidance are much appreciated.

The charts have different x/y value pairs. For one x-value, I do not know both y-values.</p>\n\n<p>I am using Silverlight. The classes available for this are <code>SerialChart</code> and <code>LineGraph</code>. The data source for both graphs is the same and is set at the <code>SerialChart</code> level. The name of the property for the x-axis is also defined there for both graphs (<code>CategoryValueMemberPath</code>).</p>\n\n<p>As suggested by the amCharts documentation, we need to create objects that have a property for the category axis (x-axis) and then one property per graph. Let's call them \"Graph1\" and \"Graph2\". So the data source looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;MyClass&gt; data = new List&lt;MyClass&gt;()\n{\n   new MyClass() { Category = 0.1, Graph1 = 0.14, Graph2 = ??? }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.15, Graph1 = ???, Graph2 = 0.05 }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.2, Graph1 = 0.35, Graph2 = ??? }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.18, Graph1 = ???, Graph2 = 0.12 }\n  ... and so on ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong> What am I supposed to do about the \"???\" values? I do not have the actual value for that graph for that category value.</p>\n\n<p>If I do not set a value, the default value of 0.0 is assumed and it draws a spike to the x-axis. If I set the previously known Graph1/Graph2 value, then it creates a horizontal connection where there is not supposed to be one. I am basically altering the graph which leads to a wrong result.</p>\n\n<p>So how do I solve this? I am getting the feeling that amCharts do not support this scenario.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","mvvm","action","viewmodel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":12815842,"title":"One ViewModel for Multiple Pages","body":"<p>I have a View Model attached with Multiple Pages.

The communication between them is through a pollingDuplexHttpBinding.\nSuppose the server wants to sent to the client a message which its size is larger than the set MaxBufferSize and MaxReceivedMessageSize. What is going behind the scenes in that case?</p>\n\n<p>Now, here is my actual experience with this issue:\nThe binding configuration on the server-side:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;binding name=\"eventServiceBinding\" sendTimeout=\"00:00:10\" inactivityTimeout=\"24:00:00\" receiveTimeout=\"24:00:00\" serverPollTimeout = \"00:01:00\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Send a large (i.e. larger than the value set in client's binding's properties as described above) message from the server to the client.

Done it both in the server side (by activating the WCF logger) and on the client side (by using Fidler). I've found nothing really interesting in the log (but maybe I didn't search in the correct places).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover - when sendTimeout is set to large value (say 10 minutes), it looks like all additional messages sent from server to client are \"stuck\" - never received by the client and no exceptions are thrown until the send timeout is reached. In addition, I experience  a strange phenomenon in which no communication between any client and any service exposed by the hosting IIS application is working - until I reset IIS.

However this solution is not good enough for daily use.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","silverlight-4.0","silverlight-toolkit"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":12781483,"title":"SilverLight RichTextBox rendering","body":"<p>Well</p>\n\n<p>I made Custom Control(richtextbox)</p>\n\n<p>problem is that can not render in xaml after saving, somthing like this displayed (xaml code)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Section xml:space=\"preserve\" HasTrailingParagraphBreakOnPaste=\"False\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontSize=\"11\" FontFamily=\"/NRA.ClientLibrary;component/Fonts/Fonts.zip#BPG Glaho\" Foreground=\"#FF000000\" FontWeight=\"Normal\" FontStyle=\"Normal\" FontStretch=\"Normal\" CharacterSpacing=\"0\" Typography.AnnotationAlternates=\"0\" ........ \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that my RichTextBox look like this ...</p>\n\n<p>\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n            </p>\n\n<pre><code>        &lt;ComboBox SelectionChanged=\"cmbFontSizes_SelectionChanged\"  Width=\"45\"&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"8\" Tag=\"8\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"9\" Tag=\"9\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"10\" Tag=\"10\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"11\" Tag=\"11\" IsSelected=\"True\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"12\" Tag=\"12\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"14\" Tag=\"14\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"16\" Tag=\"16\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"18\" Tag=\"18\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"20\" Tag=\"20\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"22\" Tag=\"22\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"24\" Tag=\"24\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"26\" Tag=\"26\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"28\" Tag=\"28\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"36\" Tag=\"36\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"48\" Tag=\"48\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"72\" Tag=\"72\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\n\n        &lt;ComboBox SelectedIndex=\"0\" SelectionChanged=\"cmbFontColors_SelectionChanged\" Width=\"55\"&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FFFF0000\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Red\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF008000\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Green\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF0000FF\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Blue\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FFFFFF00\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Yellow\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF000000\" IsSelected=\"True\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Black\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n        &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\n\n        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\"&gt;\n\n            &lt;!--Font Formatting Buttons--&gt;\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnBold\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnBold_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"B\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\" FontSize=\"14\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnItalic\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnItalic_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"I\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\" FontSize=\"14\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnUnderline\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnUnderline_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"U\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\"  FontSize=\"14\" TextDecorations=\"Underline\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n    &lt;ScrollViewer x:Name=\"scrollViewer\" VerticalScrollBarVisibility=\"Auto\" Padding=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;RichTextBox x:Name=\"richTextBox\" ContentChanged=\"richTextBox_ContentChanged\" AcceptsReturn=\"True\" TextWrapping=\"Wrap\" Height=\"75\" Background=\"Transparent\" BorderThickness=\"0\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Code Behind</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string Text\n{\n    get { return (string)GetValue(TextProperty);

How can I free them?","body":"<p>I am having a strange behavior that I believe is related to the Binding. Basically, I suspect that the binding of my controls on my ViewModel creates a strong reference from the PropertyChanged event to the control. So the ViewModel always keeps a reference to the controls. Therefore, even though I am done with the controls, they are always kept in memory. This will remain until I destroy my ViewModel, but in my case, I have one ViewModel for everything. Is there a way I can unhook the events created by the bindings?</p>\n\n<p>Here is a more detailed explanation of my issue, and the one that lead me to the above belief:</p>\n\n<p>I have a ViewModel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ViewModel()\n{\n    InitializeCommands();\n}\n\npublic ICommand OpenPropertiesCommand { get; set; }\n\nprivate void InitializeCommands()\n{\n    OpenPropertiesCommand = new DelegateCommand((o) =&gt;\n    {\n        OpenProperties(o as ContentControl);\n    });\n}\n\nprivate void OpenProperties(ContentControl propertiesWindowOwner)\n{\n    JobProperties jp = new JobProperties(this);\n    jp.WindowStartupLocation = Telerik.Windows.Controls.WindowStartupLocation.CenterOwner;\n    jp.Owner = propertiesWindowOwner;\n    jp.ShowDialog();\n}\n\nprivate Job selectedJob;\npublic Job SelectedJob\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return selectedJob;\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        selectedJob = value;\n        RaisePropertyChanged(\"SelectedJob\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ViewModel is used by my Main control. On this control, I have a GridView where each Row is a \"Job\". You can edit Job's properties, which will in turn open a RadWindow Control that lets you edit each job's properties.</p>\n\n<p>My PropertyEdit Control is a RadWindow that uses the same ViewModel as it's DataContext. All of it's components bind on SelectedJob.something where something is a property of Job.</p>\n\n<p>If I open Job #1 properties. A PropertyEdit control is created and binding is established. My properties SelectedJob.something are getting accessed once for each binding as should be. If I close the PropertyEdit control and open Job #1 properties again. One more PropertyEdit control is created and binding is established. Now if I close this one, and select another Job, a PropertyChanged event is called on selectedJob and my bindings are called twice for each binding. In effect, the first PropertyEdit control binding are activated, and the second PropertyEdit bindings are also activated. Now if I opened Job #1 properties 100 times, when I select Job #2, bindings will be queried 100 times for each one of them. Therefore, I suspect a memory leak, where the bindings are keeping my PropertyEdit control in memory, because they hold a reference to all of them. Until I destroy my ViewModel, those references will be kept, but in my case, it is my Main app's ViewModel, and will never be destroyed. How can I prevent this from happening? Is there a way I can unregister the binding's events manually?</p>\n\n<p>Thank You.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","datagrid"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12747937,"title":"Silverlight DataGrid - How to put cell in edit mode via command?","body":"<p>I have a datagrid, and we need to do some re-ordering of the items, UI is setup so that on each row there a icon for reordering.

However, I feel this is very ugly and has unnecessary excess code+logic floating around. I am hoping the HTTP Cache headers have a work around similar to the one that I am having.

(*)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The * part of this is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(*) This true in 99.9% case.  There is another rule about the visibility of the default constructor of a class (which we'll get into next week when we dig deeper into the security model), which also requires that the base class' default constructor (if it has one), must be transparent as well.  Practically speaking, you're not generally going to find interesting transparent types in the platform which do not also have transparent default constructors, so this rule doesn't normally come into play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is, however, one such interesting transparent type which does not have a transparent default constructor - the WebClient class. There's also a good reason to want to subclass it - to override GetWebRequest to provide support for cookies.</p>\n\n<p>As a test, I've tried the following both with and without the constructor attribute...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyWebClient : WebClient\n{\n    [SecuritySafeCritical] // matches the attribute on the base class ctor\n    public MyWebClient() { }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but get the following error either way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inheritance security rules violated while overriding member: 'MyWebClient..ctor()'. Security accessibility of the overriding method must match the security accessibility of the method being overriden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It looks to me like this is the 0.1% case that he mentions.

We will give the users link to this webpart page but not the document library itself. </p>\n\n<p>However if a user goes to the 'All site contents' page, he can still easily see the document library and hence download the files. </p>\n\n<p>My question is : is there a way to have the files viewable without letting the user having the link to download it ? \nIf there are any better ways, I would like to know as well. </p>\n\n<p>Many thanks </p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","treeview","treeviewitem"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12680328,"title":"How show line between TreeViewItem silverlight 5","body":"<p>I have one TreeView control with silverlight 5 in my project, my result is this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i46.tinypic.com/1110zlu.png\" alt=\"http://i46.tinypic.com/1110zlu.png\"></p>\n\n<p>BUT!\nI need show lines between TreeViewItens so:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i50.tinypic.com/50jkhj.png\" alt=\"http://i50.tinypic.com/50jkhj.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Please, how do I do this????!!!</p>\n\n<p>Thx for help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","reference","automapper"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":2,"question_id":12642365,"title":"Equivalent of automapper in a silverlight project","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight 5 project.

I want the Grid to size itself based on all of its children <em>except</em> the ScrollViewer, which I want to just take up the space that is created by sizing the Grid for the rest of its children. (For example, the Grid is 2x2 and the ScrollViewer is in Row 0, Column 0, and so the other three Grid entries are enough to determine the dimensions of the Grid.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there a nice way to do this? I've looked into creating a Custom Panel either to replace the Grid or to contain the ScrollViewer, but at no point during the MeasureOverride/ArrangeOverride calls do I ever get a call which can tell me about the final width/height of the grid row/column I care about (eg, Row 0, Column 0).</p>\n\n<p>One thought I had was to derive from Grid and call the base MeasureOverride/ArrangeOverride but remove the ScrollViewer from the Children of the Grid right before the call (and put it back afterwards), but messing with the visual tree during layout computation seems like a bad idea.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=\"LayoutRoot\" Background=\"White\"&gt;\n    &lt;Grid VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\"&gt;\n        &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n            &lt;RowDefinition/&gt;\n            &lt;RowDefinition/&gt;\n        &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n        &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n            &lt;ColumnDefinition/&gt;\n            &lt;ColumnDefinition/&gt;\n        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n        &lt;ScrollViewer Grid.Row=\"0\" Grid.Column=\"0\" ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=\"Auto\" ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=\"Auto\"&gt;\n            &lt;Button Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;\n        &lt;Button Grid.Row=\"1\" Grid.Column=\"0\" Height=\"100\" Width=\"100\" Content=\"1,0\"/&gt;\n        &lt;Button Grid.Row=\"0\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Height=\"100\" Width=\"100\" Content=\"0,1\"/&gt;\n        &lt;Button Grid.Row=\"1\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Height=\"100\" Width=\"100\" Content=\"1,1\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would like the size of the Grid to not change as the size of the Button in the ScrollViewer changes - e.g., I want the Grid to give the ScrollViewer the 100x100 square that is determined by the rest of the Grid's contents.

I'm trying to make a push towards doing Silverlight development instead, since it would take better advantage of the .NET developers on staff.  I prefer the Silverlight platform over the Flex platform for the simple fact that Silverlight is all .NET code.  We have more .NET developers on staff than Flash/Flex developers, and most of our Flash/Flex developers are graphic artists (not real programmers).  Only reason they push towards Flex right now is because it seems like the logical step from Flash.</p>\n\n<p>I've done development using both, and I honestly believe Silverlight is easier to work with.  But I'm trying to convince people who are only Flash developers. </p>\n\n<p>So here's my question:  If I'm going to go into a meeting to praise Silverlight, why would a company want to go with Silverlight instead of Flex?  Other than the obvious \"not everyone has Silverlight\", what are the pros and cons for each?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wpf","silverlight","xaml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12661928,"title":"How specify object in datagrid binding","body":"<p>How can I specify object in DataGrid binding?\nMy datagrid have <code>ItemsSource=\"{Binding Source=TripsCollection}\"</code> and <code>AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\"</code>, and Columns set as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;DataGrid.Columns&gt;\n     &lt;DataGridTextColumn Header=\"ID\" Binding=\"{Binding TripID}\" IsReadOnly=\"True\"&gt;&lt;/DataGridTextColumn&gt;\n     ...\n&lt;/DataGrid.Columns&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But have errors: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>System.Windows.Data Error: 40 : BindingExpression path error: 'TripID'\n  property not found on 'object' ''Char' (HashCode=7209070)'.\n  BindingExpression:Path=TripID; DataItem='Char' (HashCode=7209070);\n  target element is 'TextBlock' (Name=''); target property is 'Text'\n  (type 'String').</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can I set object to Trip object?</p>\n\n<p>DataContext class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private ObservableCollection&lt;Trip&gt; _tripsCollection;\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Trip&gt; TripsCollection\n    {\n        get { return _tripsCollection; }\n        set { _tripsCollection = value; NotifyPropertyChanged(\"TripsCollection\"); }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Trip class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Table(Name=\"Trips\")]\npublic class Trip\n{\n    private uint _tripID;\n    private string _start;\n    private string _end;\n    private DateTime _date;\n    private double _length;\n    private string _note;\n    private uint _carID = 0;\n    private EntityRef&lt;Car&gt; _Car;\n\n    ..and properties for this fields..\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Setting up DataContext</p>\n\n<pre><code>public MainWindow()\n{\n    InitializeComponent();\n    string connString = @\"Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS; Integrated security=SSPI; Connect Timeout=30\"; // User Instance=True\";\n    conn = new SqlConnection(connString);\n    conn.Open();\n\n    LogBookViewModel lbvm = new LogBookViewModel(conn);\n    DataContext = lbvm;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","windows-phone-7","bing-maps","kml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":578,"score":1,"question_id":7451332,"title":"Display locations based on KML file in Bing Windows Phone 7","body":"<p>Currently i am using the following code to display locations on a map in my application:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    //Bustop 8448 – \n\n    Pushpin BusStop8448 = new Pushpin();\n    BusStop8448.Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red);\n    BusStop8448.Location = new GeoCoordinate(-36.934608, 174.73016);\n    BusStop8448.Content = \"Bus Stop: 8448 \";\n    BusStop8448.MouseLeftButtonUp += new MouseButtonEventHandler(BusStop8448_MouseLeftButtonUp);\n    var BusStop8448Press = sender as Pushpin;\n\n\n    this.Map.Children.Add(BusStop8448);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is very tedious as there are hundreds of locations to add, so I was thinking about displaying locations based on a KML file.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how do I display pushpins based on a KML file in windows phone 7 Bing Maps?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I would like to know if there is a way of having an Onclick event for each of these pushpins from the KML file.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I am using the below code which works file, but I 'm not sure how I would implemented that with KML based pushpins</p>\n\n<pre><code>void BusStop8679_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n{\n\n    int id = 8679;\n    NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri(\"/DepartureBoard.xaml?ListingId=\" + id, UriKind.Relative));           \n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","browser","usb","device","technologies"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":467,"score":0,"question_id":10705892,"title":"Proprietary USB device access via browser... possible?

Especially when done async.</p>\n\n<p>I've got a big stack of legacy asmx web services. I have a little utility in WPF that accesses a few and I'd like to move it over to the web.

The next thing I noticed is, when I try and call the web service, I can't just run it and get a return since only the async method is appearing. That can be useful, sure, but most of the web service calls are things where you have to stop and directly wait for a return, so most of the time it's kind of pointless.

I wrote a class called AutoComplete which inherits from AutoCompleteBox and contains a DataGridSelectionAdapter (substituting for ListBox).

The first time a search term is typed in, the columns size properly to fit the contents of the cells.

A common use might look something like the following, which I've seen used repeatedly in WinForms applications without ever coming across the \"poisoned RCW\" described in the article linked by Hans:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create an Excel.Application instance</li>\n<li>Open or create a workbook</li>\n<li>Write data to the workbook</li>\n<li>Show Excel if all went well, close the workbook and call Application.Quit if not.</li>\n<li>Call Marshal.ReleaseComObject to release all Excel object references.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Failing to call Marshal.ReleaseComObject as recommended by Hans will leave multiple copies of Excel.exe running, as described in the KB article mentioned above - highly undesirable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The sample I'm using to repro this is a sample from the source code for Pete Brown's book Silverlight 4 in action, there's a download link on this page.  The sample solution AutomatingExcel is in Ch05.zip / 5.03.  To repro:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure no instances of Excel are running</li>\n<li>Run AutomatingExcel sample</li>\n<li>An Excel workbook is opened</li>\n<li>Close Excel</li>\n<li>Observe with Task Manager that Excel is still running.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Setting all the dynamic variables to null and calling GC.Collect() seems to work as pointed out in AnthonyWJones's answer.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Otaku's answer is what I was looking for - by wrapping references in a using statement the COM references are released without the need to call GC.Collect.  A bit of experimentation shows that it's more tolerant of failing to dispose every single reference, unlike the standard <code>Marshal.ReleaseComObject</code> solution described in the KB article referenced above.</p>\n\n<p>It would be interesting to have an authoritative take on exactly what must be disposed to ensure that all Excel references are released.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":12640936,"title":"How do you handle Expired WCF Session in a single location in the Silverlight client?","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight client which consumes a wcf service through the ServiceReference that was auto-generated with VisualStudio.</p>\n\n<p>In case the user has left his computer idle and the WCF session has expired, then the WCF service will respond to any call with a specific error message that can be recognized on the client like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(e.Error.Message == \"SessionExpired\"){\n   //redirect to login page\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Up to this point everything is fine. </p>\n\n<p>Now my problem is that I have to copy paste this session checking code in all the completedEventHandlers in the entire client. \nHow could I avoid this?

Below is the Screenshot of my screen where you can see half image below other controls.\nThanks \nRegards\nVJ\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jiYnc.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">enter image description here</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12634991,"title":"ExpanderView in Windows Phone 7","body":"<p>I am using Expanderview of Silverlight in WP7, it works fine, but I want it should expand only when I tap on \"+\" button. </p>\n\n<p>Currently it expands when I click on parent text area.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help me please???</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","wcf","silverlight","wcf-ria-services"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":1,"question_id":12363475,"title":"Difference between Webservice and WCF?","body":"<p>Is there any difference between</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Webservice and WCF</li>\n<li>WCF and WCF RIA Data Services</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>it seems to be the same.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":12634134,"title":"DropDownList is not expanding inside a ScrollViewer","body":"<p>In my application i used a DropDownList inside a ScrollViewer.

So, if the HasPrevision checkbox is CHECKED, the PrevisionType must be selected, but if the HasPrevision checkbox is NOT CHECKED, the PrevisionType comboBox can be left unselected.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the XAML for those controls (I won't show all the xaml here because it's rather big, but I believe that the problem can be solved just by showing those lines):</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- The HasPrevision CheckBox --&gt;\n&lt;CheckBox Grid.Column=\"1\"\n  Grid.Row=\"3\"\n  x:Name=\"cbxHasPrevision\"\n  IsChecked=\"{Binding SelectedJob.HasPrevision, Mode=TwoWay}\"\n  Margin=\"0,20,2,0\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- The PrevisionType ComboBox --&gt;\n&lt;telerik:RadComboBox Grid.Column=\"1\"\n  Grid.Row=\"4\"\n  x:Name=\"cmbPrevisionType\"\n  IsEnabled=\"{Binding HasPrevision, Converter={StaticResource ControlesCadastroProcessoConverter}, ConverterParameter=IsEnabled}\"\n  ItemsSource=\"{Binding PrevisionTypeList, Mode=OneWay}\"                             \n  SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedJob.PrevisionType , Mode=TwoWay, NotifyOnValidationError=True, ValidatesOnDataErrors=True, ValidatesOnExceptions=True, ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors=True}\"\n  Margin=\"0,4,48,4\"\n  Height=\"22\"\n  DisplayMemberPath=\"DsPrevisionType\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, the HasPrevision and the PrevisionType properties are binded to a property in my ViewModel called SelectedJob. SelectedJob is a Job object. All I want to do is use the IDataErrorInfo interface in my Job Class to identify if the PrevisionType is selected. Now, I can only require a PrevisionType if the HasPrevision property is \"true\", so my job class has this code for the IDataErrorInfo:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public string this[string columnName]\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            switch (columnName)\n            {\n                case \"PrevisionType\":                      \n                    if (HasPrevision &amp;&amp; (PrevisionType== null))\n                        return \"Select a PrevisionType\";\n                    break;\n            }\n            return null;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>    }</h2>\n\n<p>This sounds very logical to me. When I debug the code, it actually works: the switch identifies the columnName, it enters the case \"PrevisionType\" and it actually runs the return code inside the If statement returning the error message, not the default \"return null\" clause. But the error message don't show the error! Even worse: the combo box wont event validate automatically.\nWhen the \"Save\" button is clicked, I check for errors and set the PrevisionType comboBox to the InvalidFocused state. The comboBox DOES get the red border around it indicating that it is in an error state, but the error message is blank. When I hover my mouse of the control, an empty small red box appears, with nothing on it. </p>\n\n<p>Even more weird than that: if I REMOVE the \"HasPrevision\" check from the IF statement, leaving the code as follow, the message is shown and the control is validated automatically!!!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public string this[string columnName]\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            switch (columnName)\n            {\n                case \"PrevisionType\":                      \n                    if (PrevisionType== null)\n                        return \"Select a PrevisionType\";\n                    break;\n            }\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Everything I can think of is that since I'm trying to validate a property based on another property value, somewhere in the middle of the set's and get's the Silverlight environment gets \"confused\"? I don't know, I've been trying to find a solution for this for 2 days with no success. \nHere are some of the other codes that I believe that are relevant. </p>\n\n<p>The properties in my Job Class:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>    private bool _HasPrevision;\n    [DataMember]\n    public bool HasPrevision\n    {\n        get { return _HasPrevision; }\n        set\n        {\n            _HasPrevision= value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(\"HasPrevision\");\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    private PrevisionType.PrevisionType _PrevisionType { get; set; }\n    [DataMember]\n    public PrevisionType.PrevisionType PrevisionType\n    {\n        get { return _PrevisionType; }\n        set\n        {\n            _PrevisionType = value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(\"PrevisionType\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My SelectedJob property in my ViewModel is:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public const string SelectedJobPropertyName = \"SelectedJob\";\n    private Objects.Register.Job.Job _SelectedJob = null;\n    public Objects.Register.Job.Job SelectedJob\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _SelectedJob;\n        }\n\n        set\n        {\n            if (_SelectedJob == value)\n                return;\n\n            var oldValue = _SelectedJob;\n            _SelectedJob = value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(SelectedJobPropertyName , oldValue, value, true);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>And my code for the Save Button is:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>[...]\n\nif(SelectedJob[\"PrevisionType\"] != null)\n{\n    VisualStateManager.GoToState(cmbPrevisionTypeControl, \"InvalidFocused\", true);\n    return;\n}\n\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance and I'm sorry if I got a  little bit confused on explaining this.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 1: I had already read on those questions here, but they don't quite help me:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788287/idataerrorinfo-not-seeing-any-error-message-even-though-one-gets-picked-up\">IDataErrorInfo - not seeing any error message even though one gets picked up</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5183249/silverlight-idataerrorinfo-message-does-not-show-in-custom-controls-textbox\">Silverlight IDataErrorInfo message does not show in custom control&#39;s textbox</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":1,"question_id":7879460,"title":"How to make HyperlinkButton navigate to an existing instance of a .xaml view?","body":"<p>The following xaml snippets will cause a new instance of admin.xaml to be created every time it is navigated to.

to record accelerometer readings in a persistent storage file on a windows phone","body":"<p>``I am trying to develop a Windows phone application which can record accelerometer readings after every 10 secs or so to a persistent file storage area.</p>\n\n<p>For that, I have written a program code which gets the accelerometer readings and displays them seperately( one textblock for x reading, one for y reading and one for z reading).

THe service agent inturn calls a WCF service which is configured with a custombinding with binary encoding and httptransport. This WCF service is hoested in the same application as Silverlight and the calls from service agent is being made through \"operationame\"Async methods. Theservice agent has custom events that will be fired when \"operation\"Completed method is called. This service agent event will be handled by silverlight. This WCF service again makes a call to a distributed WCF service using \"operationame\"Async method.</p>\n\n<p>My silverlight application has four different widgets in the screen and they make four calls to the service agent. The four calls from the service agent are being triggered parallely to the in process WCF service.

Why is that so?</p>\n\n<p>Update: Looks like XmlSerializer is getting confused as to which reference to load.That's because Silverlight has XmlSerializer defined inside System.Xml.Serialization.dll assembly and .NET framework has it in System.Xml.dll. My project D has reference to System.Xml and C has System.Xml and System.Xml.Serialization. How do I make sure C always references Silverlight version of dlls?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight","timeout"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":286,"score":1,"question_id":9347852,"title":"Increase Timeout in silverlight application","body":"<p>I have a silverlight 4 application with RIA service enabled, also the silverlight uses a WCF service and the whole things are hosted on IIS.\nI need to increase the timeout of the silverlight for the WCF service and ria services, and IIS 7.5.\nHow can I set the releated timeout settings (ria services, WCF, IIS)?\nP.S</p>\n\n<p>where are the correspoding fields in the configuration?</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","silverlight-4.0","wcf"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2061,"score":1,"question_id":4150493,"title":"Silverlight 4 WCF RIA Service Timeout Problem","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight 4 usercontrol that calls a very long running WCF RIA service.

The problem is: I don't want to repeat it in every view CodeBehind I have, so I decided to make a custom ViewBase where I would leave this code on it. What I did was simply:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ViewBase : ChildWindow\n{\n    protected void tboxTextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        TextBox txCtl = (TextBox)sender; if (txCtl != null)\n        {\n            var be = txCtl.GetBindingExpression(TextBox.TextProperty);\n\n            if (be != null)\n            {\n                be.UpdateSource();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then my view now is a ViewBase, instead of a UserControl, so I also changed the XAML to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;src:ViewBase x:Class=\"Oi.SCPOBU.Silverlight.Pages.CadastroClassificacao\"\nxmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"    \nxmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\nxmlns:src=\"clr-namespace:Oi.SCPOBU.Silverlight.Pages\" [...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, in my textbox I left the event referencing the same method as usual, but now the method is in ViewBase, istead of being in the CodeBehind:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;TextBox\n   x:Name=\"tbxNome\"\n   Width=\"300\"\n   MaxLength=\"50\"\n   HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\"\n   TextChanged=\"tboxTextChanged\"\n   Text=\"{Binding DTOClassificacao.Nome, Mode=TwoWay, NotifyOnValidationError=True&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Seems pretty straightforward to me, but this doesn't work. The code compiles, but in runtime I get the error: \"Message=Failed to assign to property 'System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.TextChanged'. [Line: 43 Position: 37]\", on the InitializeComponent() Method. </p>\n\n<p>Anybody knows how can I assign a method from my base class to an event?

(Errors occurred if I tried to make it abstract.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyChildWindow : ChildWindow\n{\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty IsBusyProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\"IsBusy\", typeof(bool), typeof(MyChildWindow), null);\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty BusyContentProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\"BusyContent\", typeof(object), typeof(MyChildWindow), null);\n\n    public bool IsBusy\n    {\n        get { return (bool)GetValue(IsBusyProperty); }\n        set { SetValue(IsBusyProperty, value); }\n    }\n\n    public object BusyContent\n    {\n        get { return GetValue(BusyContentProperty); }\n        set { SetValue(BusyContentProperty, value); }\n    }\n\n    public MyChildWindow()\n    {\n        this.Style = Application.Current.Resources[\"MyChildWindowStyle\"] as Style;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Make sure to add a new ChildWindow, and change the &lt;controls:ChildWindow to &lt;gs:MyChildWindow (same with the code-behind).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, update the static SetBusyIndicator method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void SetBusyIndicator(string busyText, Uri busyImage)\n{\n    var op = VisualTreeHelper.GetOpenPopups().Where(o =&gt; o.Child is MyChildWindow);\n    if (op.Any())\n    {\n        var bidc = new MyBusyIndicatorDataContext(busyText, busyImage);\n        foreach (System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup p in op)\n        {\n            var c = p.Child as MyChildWindow;\n            c.BusyContent = bidc;\n            c.IsBusy = true;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        BusyIndicator b = Current.RootVisual as BusyIndicator;\n        if (b != null)\n        {\n            b.BusyContent = new MyBusyIndicatorDataContext(busyText, busyImage);\n            b.IsBusy = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not sure this is the most efficient, but it does seem to work nicely.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wcf","silverlight","security"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2130,"score":1,"question_id":627353,"title":"Silverlight/WCF login session","body":"<p>I am working on a system with Silverlight and using WCF to call services to do all of the work on the server side.  </p>\n\n<p>I need to have a user log into the system, and once they are verified, all calls to the server need to contain the user info so the server can check security policies and do other operations based on the user.  </p>\n\n<p>What is the best way to do this?

And if I cannot see anything very likely is not.\nThanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","datagrid"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2189,"score":2,"question_id":1516545,"title":"Silverlight Checkbox inside datagrid causing Trouble","body":"<p>Hi all i came across a problem with the checkboxes inside the datagrid.</p>\n\n<p>First let me post my code of what i have achieved and then i will tell what's causing the trouble</p>\n\n<p>This is the code of my datagrid inside a child window</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Controls:DataGrid x:Name=\"dgAthlete\" Height=\"Auto\" Width=\"Auto\"\n                                       IsReadOnly=\"True\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\"\n                                       HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\"\n                                       HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=\"Disabled\"\n                                       ItemsSource=\"{Binding Data, ElementName=dds}\"\n                                   &gt;\n            &lt;Controls:DataGrid.Columns&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn Header=\"CheckBoxColumn\"&gt;\n                    &lt;Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\n                        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n                            &lt;CheckBox  x:Name=\"cbAddAthlete\"  IsChecked=\"{Binding IsAdded}\" Tag=\"{Binding}\"\n                            IsEnabled=\"True\" Checked=\"cbAddAthlete_Checked\" Unchecked=\"cbAddAthlete_Unchecked\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n                    &lt;/Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\n                    &lt;Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;\n                        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n                            &lt;CheckBox IsChecked=\"{Binding Path=IsAdded,Mode=TwoWay}\"/&gt;\n                        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n                    &lt;/Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;\n                &lt;/Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;\n\n\n\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;\n                    &lt;Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\n                        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n                            &lt;Image Source=\"{Binding ImageFileName}\"\n                                                Width=\"25\" Height=\"25\"\n                                                HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n                    &lt;/Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\n                &lt;/Controls:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"FirstName\" Binding=\"{Binding FirstName}\" /&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"MiddleName\" Binding=\"{Binding MiddleName}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"LastName\" Binding=\"{Binding LastName}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Email\"  Binding=\"{Binding Email}\" /&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"DOB\" Binding=\"{Binding BirthDate}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Phone\" Binding=\"{Binding PhoneNumber}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Website\" Binding=\"{Binding WebSite}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Team\" Binding=\"{Binding TeamName}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Club\" Binding=\"{Binding ClubName}\"/&gt;\n                &lt;Controls:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"County\" Binding=\"{Binding CountyName}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/Controls:DataGrid.Columns&gt;\n        &lt;/Controls:DataGrid&gt;\n        &lt;Controls:DataPager x:Name=\"dpAthlete\" PageSize=\"4\"\n                 HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Source=\"{Binding Data, ElementName=dds}\"\n                 Width=\"Auto\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n    &lt;Button x:Name=\"CancelButton\" Content=\"Cancel\" Click=\"CancelButton_Click\" Width=\"75\" Height=\"23\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Right\" Margin=\"0,12,0,0\" Grid.Row=\"1\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Button x:Name=\"OKButton\" Content=\"OK\" Click=\"OKButton_Click\" Width=\"75\" Height=\"23\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Right\" Margin=\"0,12,79,0\" Grid.Row=\"1\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code behind for this is </p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class AddAthletesToCompetition : ChildWindow\n{\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Athlete&gt;

The app depends on a Wcf service that is part of a different project but should always be hosted on the same server as my project (albeit on a different port). I do not want to have to remember to modify the address of the service's endpoint in the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file every time I deploy to a new environment. Since there is no way to specify multiple ServiceReferences.ClientConfig(s) for a project (like you can with Web.Config(s)), I followed the advice <a href=\"http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2010/04/05/managing-service-references-in-silverlight-applications-for-different-environments.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> to create a reference for each environment in my ServiceReferences.ClientConfig.

Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","silverlight","silverlight-5.0"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":265,"score":6,"question_id":12218384,"title":"How to detect back button or forward button navigation in a silverlight navigation application","body":"<p>When a Page is navigated to in silverlight you can override this method.</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)\n{\n    base.OnNavigatedTo(e);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>NavigationEventArgs</code> has a <code>NavigationMode</code> enumeration which is defined as </p>\n\n<pre><code>public enum NavigationMode\n{\n    New = 0,\n    Back = 1,\n    Forward = 2,\n    Refresh = 3,\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But calling <code>e.NavigationMode</code> always throws a <code>NotImplementedException</code></p>\n\n<p>Is there a way in silverlight to detect a page is being navigated to because the user hit the forward/back browser button.</p>\n\n<p>What I am trying to achieve is some kind of state that can be preserved when the user hits the back button.</p>\n\n<p>For example assume you have a customer page which is showing a list of customers in a datagrid.

The selected subreports get aggregated into one big report, and this report is launched in a new window.\nEach subreport has its own set of parameters. As such, the parameter-value list can get very long. Previously, the application would use the GET method to pass parameter values, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://&lt;serverName&gt;/_vti_bin/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?http://&lt;reportPath&gt;&amp;rs:Command=Render&amp;rs:ClearSession=true&amp;rc:Parameters=false&amp;rc:Toolbar=true&amp;rc:Zoom=100&amp;FacilityUniqueValues=A&amp;WorkWeek=0&amp;...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But with long parameter-value lists, the URL could easily exceed 2000 characters. At around this length or greater, the report fails -- the browser just gives an HTTP 404 page. I figured this was due to a URL length limit somewhere along the line, so, after looking up solutions, I made it use the POST method to pass parameters, exactly as described in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/9175975/908291\">this SO answer</a>. The URL above would now just look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://&lt;serverName&gt;/_vti_bin/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?&lt;reportPath&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, the problem persists exactly as before when the parameter-value list is long.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that, when the list is shorter and the report is shown successfully, the browser redirects to a URL in the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://&lt;serverName&gt;/_layouts/ReportServer/RSViewerPage.aspx?rv:RelativeReportUrl=&lt;relativeReportPath&gt;&amp;rv%3aParamMode=Hidden&amp;rv%3aZoom=100&amp;rp%3aFacilityUniqueValues=A&amp;rp%3aWorkWeek=0&amp;...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i.e. The values are made into GET parameters anyway. I don't understand this, as I've seen many recommendations to use POST for getting around URL length limits when you have a lot of report parameters -- what's the point if it redirects to a GET URL?</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a way to propagate the Posted parameters? Or another way around this problem?</p>\n\n<p>I'm very inexperienced with most of the technologies involves, so I apologize for any relevant details I have not included -- please let me know what info may be helpful.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","entity-framework-4.1","connection-string","wcf-ria-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":149,"score":0,"question_id":12315136,"title":"Silverlight WCF RIA Services Dynamically Change Connection String","body":"<p>We have a Silverlight application which uses WCF RIA Services and Entity Framework 4.1 to connect to a database.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, the connection string is supplied, as standard within the web.config and this all works successfully.</p>\n\n<p>However, I now want to be able to change the connection string dynamically at runtime based on amongst other things, the user logged in.</p>\n\n<p>I've found some other <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4350434/silverlight-entity-framework-dynamic-connection-string\">posts</a> which hint at doing this, but they are using ObjectContext whereas we are using DbContext within the System.Data.Entity namespace and also the DbDomainService class. </p>\n\n<p>In order to compensate for this I have overidden the CreateDbContext() method within my DbDomainService implementation as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override CoreContext CreateDbContext()\n{\n    dbServer = null, dbName = null;\n\n    httpCookie = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[\"DBServer\"];\n    if (httpCookie != null)\n    {\n        dbServer = httpCookie.Value;\n    }\n\n    var cookie = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[\"DBName\"];\n    if (cookie != null)\n    {\n        dbName = cookie.Value;\n    }\n\n    if (dbServer == null &amp;&amp; dbName == null)\n    {\n        return new CoreContext();\n    }\n\n    string connStr = \"Data Source=\" + dbServer + \";Initial Catalog=\" + dbName + \";Integrated Security=true\";\n    return new CoreContext(connStr);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works successfully the first time the Silverlight application is loaded, however, on all subsequent loads, the same connection as established initially is used despite changing the values being substituted into the connection string.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to get the connection to be changed seems to be to recycle the application pool in IIS and load the app again.</p>\n\n<p>Am I doing something wrong?

Like that poster, I have set up a simple Silverlight Application project and a simple Console Application project. In each, I added a service reference to my WCF service and added a few test calls to the service. However, the time it takes for each call to go out is drastically different. The console app makes the call on the order of milliseconds. The Silverlight app makes it anywhere from 3-5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>In the post I linked to above, when the poster changed his service to use binary message encoding, the speed gap disappeared. However, in my situation, the large speed gap remains regardless of whether I'm using binary message encoding or text message encoding.</p>\n\n<p>What could account for this speed difference? I've verified through fiddler that both the request and response are being binary-encoded when I have it configured to use my binary endpoint. I've also verified that the slow speed persists through multiple consecutive web service calls, so it can't just be spin-up time.

In the locals window I can verify that <code>this.Resources[\"tooLateStyle\"]</code> returns a correct value but <code>this.FindName(\"tooLateStyle\")</code> does not. But they both return a value for <code>goodStyle</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've done a bunch of permutations of this code trying to see if there were issues with using x:Key vs. x:Name, with the names themselves, with the ordering of the definitions, with cross-referencing between them, etc.   The only interesting thing I've found is that the actual member fields are also generated inconsistently.  (In the screenshot, you'll note that there were no members generated for the brushes --- but when I delete a few Style definitions, suddenly there are members generated for brushes.)

He claimed that when the Silverlight application we have created hits a WCF web service hard with concurrent calls that the calls start to be stacked at the server. His claim was that we are using sessions because of the method of authentication we are using (using forms and asp.net membership for sql). So I created a really simple test application</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/LjHol.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of test application\"> </p>\n\n<p>The application allows me to specify the number of concurrent calls to a web service I want and then indicates the current number of outstanding calls and the average response time in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>The web service itself simple sleeps the thread for a second</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void DoWork()\n    {\n        Thread.Sleep(1000);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what I thought would happen is that if my colleague was right, then the calls would be stacking up at the server so the average response would be 2 seconds if there are two concurrent calls. However what appears to happen is that the times remain at just above a second until I get to seven concurrent requests and then it starts to increase relatively predictably.</p>\n\n<p>Running a second client (in a Chrome window along side the initial IE window) does not appear to impact the performance (there is an initial hiccup). This is not the case if you run two IE's or two Chrome's side by side, then the two seem to impact each other suggesting they are sharing a connection.</p>\n\n<p>It also seems that fiddler was interfering. I ran the application without fiddler with 7 concurrent calls and it was averaging around 1.15 seconds per call. I then started fiddler and times dropped back to just over a second, it was as if fiddler was allowing the extra calls to get through.</p>\n\n<p>So my question. What is going on here? Where is the throttling (at 6 concurrent requests) taking place (client or server)? Why does running fiddler speed up the requests?</p>\n\n<p>Some extra info.</p>\n\n<p>The web service class has a couple of attributes</p>\n\n<pre><code>[AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required)]\n[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Single, InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerSession)]\npublic class DoVeryLittle : IDoVeryLittle\n{\n    public void DoWork()\n    {\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>AspNetCompatibilityRequirements is meant to allow integration with the asp.net pipeline and authentication. The ConcurrencyMode and InstanceContextMode of the ServiceBehavour are apparently to create and instance per session. However we are using the basicHttpBinding for the endpoint and I've seen that this does not support sessions so I'm a bit confused on this.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness here are the service related entries in web.config</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n    &lt;behaviors&gt;\n        &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;\n            &lt;behavior name=\"\"&gt;\n              &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n              &lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"true\" /&gt;\n              &lt;serviceAuthorization principalPermissionMode=\"UseAspNetRoles\" roleProviderName=\"AspNetSqlRoleProvider\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/behavior&gt;\n        &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;\n    &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n  &lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=\"true\" multipleSiteBindingsEnabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","iphone","ios","silverlight","ipad"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":12278456,"title":"c# how to get access to web camera and microphone via a web page (Safari) on iPAD or iPhone","body":"<p>I am working on a project which is a ASP.NET MVC project.

I have created a ChildWindow that hosts a datagrid. This datagrid currently loads my <code>&lt;Book&gt;</code> table. I customized the data grid to bring back just the Book name and I added a checkbox column to select a particular book.  This only pops up when a user wants to multi-select books. </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to have users select all the books they want, then hit the save button, add those book names and ids to another table that has a relationship with my book table. The book table holds the list of books and book ids, and the second table <code>&lt;JM&gt;</code> is supposed to hold its own id and all the books the user selected. So that later, when a user wants to search for their books, they can call for the book or the multiple book selection and it will return all the books they selected. Easy stuff.</p>\n\n<p>However, I am currently unable to add multiple books to the table. Only one book is entered because of my selecteditems code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>JobMarket jm = new JobMarket();\nforeach (Book b in dataGrid1.SelectedItems)\n{\n    dataGrid1.SelectedItems.Add(b);\n    jm.BookID = b.BookID;\n    jm.Book = b.Book1;\n}\n_context.JobMarkets.Add(jm);\nSubmitOperation s = _context.SubmitChanges();\n\nthis.DialogResult = true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried it this way because I thought selectedItems would return all selectedItems, but it is currently just the last selected item.

I thought the foreach would loop through and find the checked boxes but it does not.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm looking for a way to fix this and to do all the operations in this one click event.

I also tried to specify MyControl as a resource (as shown commented out in the code below), and this also caused VS 2010 to crash when using MyMainControl.</p>\n\n<p>I found that if I remove \"DefaultStyleKey = typeof(MyControl)\" in the MyControl constructor, then the issue does not occur (but then MyControl's style is not applied to it and the control does not look right).</p>\n\n<p>The main goal here is that I need to allow the MyMainControl class to optionally create an instance of the MyControl class to set the MyControl property to during the instantiation of the MyMainControl class.  By default, I want the MyControl property to be set to an instance of MyControl, but I want the user to be able to specify null (or specify an instance of MyControl with different settings) for the MyControl property, in their XAML, and if they do so, I want the default internal instantiation of MyControl to not take place (in order to improve the efficiency of MyMainControl).</p>\n\n<p>I originally created the MyControl instance in the constructor of MyMainControl, but if the user sets the MyControl property to null in their MyMainControl XAML, the instance of MyControl is still needlessly created internally (and then overwritten with null), which results in much poorer performance (than just using null and not creating MyControl internally).</p>\n\n<p>In WPF, I'm able to specify MyControl as a resource and then in the generic.xaml Style of MyMainControl I'm able to set the MyControl property to an instance of the MyControl class, which has greatly improved the performance of MyMainControl if the user sets MyControl to null.  But I haven't been able to get the same to work in Silverlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, the main idea is that if I can use the MyMainControl Style to specify a default value for the MyControl property, then the user will be able to specify their own MyMainControl Style in which they can specify for the MyControl property a value of null or an instance of MyControl with different settings--and since their MyMainControl Style will replace mine, then the default instantiation of MyControl that I specify in my MyMainControl Style will not occur.</p>\n\n<p>I greatly appreciate any help anyone can provide on how this might be done in Silverlight!</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ResourceDictionary\nxmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\nxmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\nxmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyNamespace\"\n&gt;\n\n&lt;Style TargetType=\"local:MyControl\"&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"Opacity\" Value=\"1\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Style&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Note: I tried specifying my control as a resource\n(so I could in the MyMainControl style set the property to\nthe MyControl StaticResource), but include this line of XAML\ncauses VS 2010 to crash when using my main control.\n&lt;local:MyControl x:Key=\"MyControl\" /&gt;--&gt;\n\n&lt;Style TargetType=\"local:MyMainControl\"&gt;\n    &lt;Setter Property=\"MyControl\" &gt;\n        &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n            &lt;local:MyControl /&gt;\n        &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;\n    &lt;/Setter&gt;\n&lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>MyControl is a very simple class that derives from Control:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyControl : Control\n{\n    public MyControl()\n    {\n        DefaultStyleKey = typeof(MyControl);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code for the MyMainControl MyControl DependencyProperty is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class MyMainControl : Control\n{\n...\n    public static readonly DependencyProperty MyControlProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\"MyControl\", typeof(MyControl), typeof(MyMainControl), new PropertyMetadata(null));\n\n    public MyControl MyControl\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return (MyControl)GetValue(MyControlProperty);\n        }\n        set\n        {\n            SetValue(MyControlProperty, value);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12172360,"title":"Silverlight-DLL communication issue","body":"<p>Problems with Silverlight 4 application.\nIn this application every client session creates a separate process, which calls a DLL.</p>\n\n<p>Communication with DLL is built as in the following callstack (for two functions: one working, another -

Does anyone know why I can't bind via convention with Labels and TextBlocks?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","linq-to-sql","windows-phone-7","sql-server-ce"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1183,"score":3,"question_id":7555276,"title":"Linq to Sql relationship doesn't update collections","body":"<p>I'm having one issue with Linq to Sql for Windows Phone (SQL Server CE). </p>\n\n<p>I'm developing an personal finance app, and then I have the Account class and the Transaction class. Each Transaction class have a reference to the account it belongs to, so the Account class have a collection of transactions, in a one-to-many relationship. Then I have the repositories (AccountRepository and TransactionRepository) that expose methods to insert, delete, findbykey and return all instances of each of this classes. The ViewModel have references to its repositories. OK, everything works just well, but, when I create a transaction, it doesn't appear in the Account.Transactions collection untill I stop the software and run it again.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some pieces of the code, first, the model classes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Table]\npublic class Transaction : INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyPropertyChanging\n{\n    // {...}\n\n    [Column]\n    internal int _accountID;\n    private EntityRef&lt;Account&gt; _account;\n    [Association(Storage = \"_account\", ThisKey = \"_accountID\")]\n    public Account Account\n    {\n        get {return _account.Entity;}\n        set\n        {\n            NotifyPropertyChanging(\"Account\");\n            _account.Entity = value;\n\n            if (value != null)\n            {\n                _accountID = value.AccountID;\n            }\n\n            NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Account\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n\n[Table]\npublic class Account : INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyPropertyChanging\n{\n    // {...}\n\n    private EntitySet&lt;Transaction&gt; _transactions;\n\n    [Association(Storage = \"_transactions\", OtherKey = \"_accountID\")]\n    public EntitySet&lt;Transaction&gt; Transactions\n    {\n        get { return this._transactions; }\n        set { this._transactions.Assign(value); }\n    }\n\n    public Account()\n    {\n        _transaction = new EntitySet&lt;Transaction&gt;(\n            new Action&lt;Transaction&gt;(this.attach_transaction), \n            new Action&lt;Transaction&gt;(this.detach_transaction)\n            );\n    }\n\n    private void attach_transaction(Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        NotifyPropertyChanging(\"Transactions\");\n        transaction.Account = this;\n    }\n\n    private void detach_transaction(Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        NotifyPropertyChanging(\"Transactions\");\n        transaction.Account = null;\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have some repositories that implement a GetAll() method that returns an ObservableCollection. The repositories have a reference to the Context class that is created inside the ViewModel class and, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AccountRepository\n{\n    private MyContext _context;\n\n    public AccountRepository(ref MyContext context)\n    {\n        _context = context;\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Account&gt; GetAll()\n    {\n        return new ObservableCollection(_context.Accounts.Where([some paramethers]).AsEnumerable());\n\n\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My ViewModel initialize the repositories in the constructor and then expose methods with some few logic code to insert, delete, etc, each of this types.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyPropertyChanging\n{\n    private MyContext _context;\n    private AccountRepository accountRepository;\n    private TransactionRepository transactionRepository;\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Account&gt; AllAccounts;\n    public ObservableCollection&lt;Transaction&gt; AllTransactions;\n\n    public MyViewModel(string connectionString)\n    {\n        _context = new MyContext(\"Data Source=’isostore:/mydatabase.sdf’\"); if (!db.DatabaseExists()) db.CreateDatabase();\n\n        accountRepository = new AccountRepository(ref _context);\n        transactionRepository = new TransactionRepository(ref _context);\n\n        // [Some other code]\n\n        LoadCollections();           \n    }\n\n    // {...}\n\n    public void LoadCollections()\n    {\n        AllAccounts = accountRepository.GetAll();\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"AllAccounts\");\n        AllTransactions = transactionRepository.GetAll();\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"AllTransactions\");\n    }\n\n    public void InsertTransaction(Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        AllTransactions.Add(transaction);\n        transactionRepository.Add(transaction);\n\n        LoadCollections(); // Tried this to update the Accounts with newer values, but don't work...\n    }\n\n    // {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user create a Transaction, the page calls the InsertTransaction(Transaction transaction) method in the view model, that pass the transaction object to the repository. But the Transactions collection in the Account object doesn't get updated. Then I tried to call the LoadCollections() method to force a new query in the context, and try to somehow get a fresh account object, but it still without the recently created transaction. If I stop my app and start it again, the Accounts are up to date and have all transactions I've created in the last run whitin its transactions collection.</p>\n\n<p>How can I update this Transactions collection at runtime?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updating the question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I had some feedback regarding to notifying the UI that the collection was changed. Maybe I was not very clear in my explanation, I'm sorry, english isn't my first language so there's a chance what I wrote isn't necessarily what I wanted to say.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's a problem with the association between transactions and account. Once I create a transaction, it won't appear in it's account.Transactions collection until I dispose my context and create it again.</p>\n\n<p>It may be some notify fault, but I DON'T think it is and I did some code to try to prove it, I'm not in my PC right now but I'll try to explain my test.</p>\n\n<p>The code I did to prove it was something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Account c1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\nTransaction t1 = new Transaction() { Account = c1, {...} };\n\ncontext.Transactions.InsertOnSubmit(t1);\ncontext.SaveChanges();\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS NOT in the c1.Transactions collection right NOW.\n\ncontext.Dispose();\n\ncontext = new MyContext({...});\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS in the c1.Transactions after the dispose!\n\nAccount c2 = context.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\nt1 = context.Transactions.Where(t =&gt; t.TransactionID == x).SingleOrDefault();\n\nt1.Account = c2;\n\ncontext.SubmitChanges();\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction still in the c1 collection!!!\n\nc2 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// It should be in the c2 collection, but isn't yet...\n\ncontext.Dispose();\n\ncontext = new MyContext({...});\n\nc1 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 1).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction is not in the c1.Transaction anymore!\n\nc2 = context.Accounts.Where(c =&gt; c.AccountID == 2).SingleOrDefault();\n\n// The transaction IS in the c2.Transactions now!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've updated the code with the call of NotifyPropertyChanged in my view model, thanks saus for remembering me, but it still won't work. :(</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added some test code trying to find where the error may be.</p>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","silverlight","unit-testing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12163949,"title":"Thread renaming in Silverlight Unit Tests","body":"<p>In my silverlight unit tests, I have several unit test methods of a single unit test class where in each method, I'm setting Thread.Name to some string.

I am having an issue using databinding with a List of objects who have a property I want shown in a listbox.</p>\n\n<p>I have a a list box in my Silverlight child window whose xaml looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Vertical\" Width=\"235\"&gt;\n                        &lt;sdk:Label Content=\"Servers\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\"&gt;&lt;/sdk:Label&gt;\n                        &lt;!--new group servers list box--&gt;\n                        &lt;ListBox x:Name=\"NewGroupServersLB\" Height=\"150\" Width=\"200\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding}\" SelectionChanged=\"NewGroupServersLB_SelectionChanged\" &gt;\n                            &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n                                &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n                                    &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Path=ServerName}\"&gt;&lt;/TextBlock&gt;\n                                &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n                            &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n                        &lt;/ListBox&gt;\n                    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am setting its DataContext in the code behind using a Binding object instance with this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*create new binding source object */\n Binding serversBinding = new Binding();\n /*set data source */\n serversBinding.Source = childServersList;\n /*set the data source for the new group servers listbox*/\n NewGroupServersLB.DataContext = serversBinding;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can see using debugging that the Binding object's source has two members, and that they are the appropriate server object instances from my childServersList.

I have also done a fair bit of development in ASP.NET MVC, which I am quite comfortable with.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we have a number of \"backbone\" applications written using ASP.NET MVC 3 which we customize and sell to our clients whenever we're approached. These applications are all meant for internal use, hence plug-ins wouldn't be much of a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The real problem with development is that for large scale business applications with complex business rules, ASP.NET MVC tends to slow us down (writing jQuery / javascript > server side processing > return result, use jQuery to notify > alter view, something along this line). </p>\n\n<p>Then I began looking for answers that will help us improve our time to delivery and also responsiveness (well, we all know how JavaScript is capable of killing us) and my search brought me to Silverlight (we have the time to change, no worries there).</p>\n\n<p>So here comes the questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I have come across many Silverlight MVVM samples online, but all of them show applications as simple as interacting with only one Database table.

In all samples I found online, none of them use any form of DI. Is it really unnecessary? Since the idea of MVVM is to decouple, so why not also decouple ViewModel from Model? </li>\n<li>I've gone through a book published by Jeremy Likness called Designing Silverlight Business Applications. He used MEF to do the decoupling, which I think doesn't really fit into our application. We do not really need to do \"hot-plugging\". What's your take on this?</li>\n<li>MVVM is all about Commands, Databindings and No Code-behinds. What if I want to interact with UIs that do not expose to commands?

DataPager never gives me a page count greater than 1.","body":"<p>I've decided that RIA Services is way too limiting and am attempting to role my own server side pagination.  I've long since switched over to plain old WCF. Everything is going wonderfully.  My only problem, ironically, is with the front end. I'm trying to get the <code>DataPager</code> control to work. I could have (and it seems should have) created my own <code>DataPager</code> control, but I didn't want to take the time to write something as nice as the <code>DataPager</code> is (the control itself, not the client side query nonsense). The trouble I face, probably obviously, is setting the page count within the pager. It seems that the data pager is automagically tied to RIA services. I've tried creating an implementation of <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> that only references a count (i.e. returns n of default(T)).  I've tried using arrays of integers.  All of these techniques are very wasteful and whats more, they don't work. I am to the point where it would have been much faster to write my own data pager than to use this one. So I thought I'd ask what I'm doing wrong (i.e. though I know that ultimately my wrong is in using this control without the beloved RIA client side query at all).</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","silverlight","xaml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":1,"question_id":12041454,"title":"How to style heading labels in WPF/Silverlight/XAML?","body":"<p>This seems simple enough, but I'm having difficulty finding an answer.</p>\n\n<p>I have a WPF window that requires use of headings and sub-headings for different areas.

Before the upgrade, AssetLookupCommand was bound to the EntityLookupColumn's EntityLookupCommand, and so BeginAssetLookup would execute when expected (When EntityLookupColumn's CreateCellEditElement was called, EntityLookupCommand was never null).  But now, AssetLookupCommand is not bound until sometime later (now CreateCellEditElement assigns cellEditElement.EntityLookupCommand to a null value).  I have to click on this column, then click on a different column (can be even in a different row), and then click back on this column again to set AssetLookupCommand, and cause EntityLookupCommand to stop being null.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if the original design is flawed, and needs to be revisited.  Or maybe Telerik made some enhancements, which affected some of the wiring, and now I need to hook things up in a different manner.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","postgresql","silverlight-4.0","silverlight-3.0","ironpython"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":583,"score":0,"question_id":4470073,"title":"How

I can confirm that the IsSelected properties on all of the points is being toggled when expected, but when i toggle them, they aren't reflected back onto the map. To clarify, if I replace the service results with this <em>AFTER they're returned to the model</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var returned = new ObservableCollection&lt;DataPoint&gt;()\n    {\n        new DataPoint(){IsPlottable = true, IsSelected = false, X = 722762, Y = 488253},\n        new DataPoint(){IsSelected = false, X = 810000, Y = 550000, IsPlottable = true},\n        new DataPoint(){IsSelected = false, X = 801000, Y = 480000, IsPlottable = true},\n        new DataPoint(){IsSelected = false, X = 800100, Y = 500000, IsPlottable = true},\n        new DataPoint(){IsSelected = false, X = 800010, Y = 506000, IsPlottable = true}\n    };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then it works.

Could I be misattributing the issue?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thanks to comments below, I've narrowed it down to PropertyChange event handler being null whenever IsSelected is set.

Instead of trying to load the xap file I am taking the parameters on the click event of the link calling the silverlight control, serializing them and passing them to the secondary server as a serialized object. I can then pass these values into the sl control directly.

Which is a shame, because I have 4 textblocks that all use the exact same binding for their Opacity property. Is there anyway to in a sense \"style\" their Opacity property so that all four of them point to the same binding? Otherwise, I have to set each Opacity property individually. In my case it's even worse - all four share other property bindings as well, which means each TextBlock declaration is pretty dang long, and yet they're all virtually the same (their property bindings, that is). I know I could concisely set all their shared property bindings in the code-behind, but I'd like a XAML solution if there is one.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","navigation"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":109,"score":0,"question_id":11898161,"title":"C# : Blocking direct URL navigation to a silverlight page from address bar","body":"<p>A bit similar one was asked here: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4067757/prevent-user-from-navigating-directly-to-a-page-in-silverlight\">Prevent user from navigating directly to a page in silverlight</a></p>\n\n<p>The solution I found there is not working. </p>\n\n<p>My problem goes here-\nI have a silverlight business application with lots of pages. Different page requires different role of user to access it. Like a Regional Manager can access a page 'ShowAreas' but can't access the page 'ShowRegions'. Problem is once you type in the page name in the address bar like <strong><em>http://...../TrialBusinessManagerTestPage.aspx#/ShowRegions</em></strong> it navigates to the page.\nTo prevent this I thought of a way around,that is to put an <code>if-else</code> check for proper role at the beginning of each page constructor. But I have more than 60 pages and I don't think it will be wise and productive to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I did another thing too, the list of pages a specific user can navigate to is placed in a treeview in my app. So once the contentframe fires the <code>Navigating</code> event, I check the provided <code>Uri</code> whether it's in the list of valid pages for that user.

These are exactly similar, except their <code>DataTemplate</code>. The data template of the left (1st) list box has the properties of its containing <code>TextBlock</code> differently set: <code>TextWrapping=Wrap</code> and <code>TextTrimming=WordEllipsis</code>. As well it has <code>MaxHeight</code> set. It's bound to a property in code behind, because in our application this happens, either (configurability). </li>\n<li>The middle (2nd) list box is just the same as the first one, except the MaxHeight binding. I just put the value \"40\" in there (as I did in my code behind for the MaxTextHeight property). This works and looks exactly like I want the first list box look like. </li>\n<li>The right (3rd) list box just visually illustrates a list box stretched to full size. As you can see, if you run the sample code, its size is similar to the first one.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In my code behind I set all the properties <strong>after</strong> I have set the <code>DataContext</code>. That's because I want MVVM behaviour - means, after all the properties we're bound the first time, I manipulate them to get updates on the UI, sent from my \"view model\".</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can see, the first list box gets populated with its Items and stretches to full size. After the <code>MaxHeight</code> is set, the actual items shrink (in this case the 2nd list box entry, because it's too big), but the list box stays at full size. And I want this list box to shrink, either.</p>\n\n<p>I can't understand the logic behind this. Is this a Silverlight bug? The RadListBox by Telerik behaves exactly similar. But I could't reproduce the issue in WPF, with the same code.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight","rest"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":11863188,"title":"Silverlight and Web Http Binding","body":"<p>WCF RIA Services has built in PoxBinary Binding , and Transfer compressed binary XML from server to client\nI've configured wcf ria services to expose JSON endpoint , and I've configured IIS to use GZip to compress Data\nI've decompiled wcf ria services source code , and now I should provide to it a binding as like as Web Http Binding.\nSo , any one can help me ? for example by custom bindings ? or other solutions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight","rest","silverlight-3.0"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":698,"score":2,"question_id":2267853,"title":"Does Silverlight support WebHttpBinding?","body":"<p>Does Silverlight 3.0 support WebHttpBinding for WCF RESTful services?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","silverlight","hierarchical-data"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":0,"question_id":11861454,"title":"How to show this flat list properly?","body":"<pre><code>LIST ONE                    LIST TWO\n\n[ ] Parent 1                - Entry (from Child 1)\n    [X] Child 1             - Entry (from Child 1)\n        [ ] ChildChild 1    - Entry (from ChildChild 1)\n    [ ] Child 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LIST ONE</strong> contains hierarchical data.

I have read that thread, and highly suggest reading it before calling duplicate question on this one. </p>\n\n<h2>Part 1) Is it possible to define an implicit conversion of enums <strong>in Silverlight?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Starting with the simple enum ContactState that defines the states of an electrical contact.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// The state of an electrical contact which can either be closed (current flows through)\n/// or open (current does not flow through).\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic enum ContactState\n{\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The contact is open, electrical current does not flow through.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    Open = 0,\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The contact is closed, electrical current flows through.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    Closed = 1,\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Haivng read the thread listed in the note above, I attempted to create a non-generic class that would be able to implicitly convert a boolean value to a ContactState. (Thanks to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2949340/1518265\">Mark</a> for providing the base code. This is using the non-generic class.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>public sealed class ContactState\n{\n    private static readonly Dictionary&lt;bool, ContactState&gt; Values = new Dictionary&lt;bool, ContactState&gt;();\n\n    public static readonly ContactState Open = new ContactState(false);\n    public static readonly ContactState Closed = new ContactState(true);\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The value of an instance.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    private readonly bool Value;\n\n    private ContactState(bool val)\n    {\n        this.Value = val;\n        Values.Add(val, this);\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator ContactState(bool val)\n    {\n        return Values[val];\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator bool(ContactState val)\n    {\n        return val.Value;\n    }        \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>One significant difference is that we must use Dictionary from the Silverlight V4 Library instead of using SortedList from the .NETv4 library: this is because SortedList does not exist in the Silverlight library.</em></p>\n\n<p>The above code works, compiles and allows for the desired implicit conversion. I cannot attest to its security / stability. However, it leads us to the next item....</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Part 2) Is it poor programming practice xor an elegant solution to define implicit conversion of enums?</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose that instead of being the creator an enum, that instead one has already been created and cannot be modified by us. In this case, consider it to be a coil that only has two possibilities.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// The state of an electrical coil which can either be closed (current flows through)\n/// or open (current does not flow through).\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic enum CoilState\n{\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The coil is open, electrical current does not flow through.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    Open = 0,\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The coil is closed, electrical current flows through.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    Closed = 1,\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is all well and good, but again we want the functionality that comes from implicitly converting to bool. Therefore, the class ContactState is created such that it can implicitly convert between CoilState as well as bool:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public sealed class ContactState\n{\n    private static readonly Dictionary&lt;bool, ContactState&gt; Values = new Dictionary&lt;bool, ContactState&gt;();\n\n    public static readonly ContactState Open = new ContactState(false);\n    public static readonly ContactState Closed = new ContactState(true);\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// The value of an instance.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    private readonly bool Value;\n\n    private ContactState(bool val)\n    {\n        this.Value = val;\n        Values.Add(val, this);\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator ContactState(bool val)\n    {\n        return Values[val];\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator bool(ContactState val)\n    {\n        return val.Value;\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator CoilState(ContactState val)\n    {\n        return val.Value ? CoilState.Closed : CoilState.Open;\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator ContactState(CoilState val)\n    {\n        return Values[val == CoilState.Closed];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The advantage (in my mind) of creating the ContactState class as shown above is that operations in code can be done such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Using ContactState conversion\n        CoilState coil = CoilState.Open;\n\n        ContactState contact = true;\n        ContactState contact2 = ContactState.Closed;\n        ContactState contact3 = CoilState.Closed;\n\n        // Now the coilState has been assigned a value of CoilState.Closed\n        // without have to explicitly cast the value to CoilState.\n        //\n        // All three are valid declarations.\n        coil = contact;\n        coil = contact2;\n        coil = contact3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this version of ContactState compiles, and operates as expected; the question being \"Is this an appropriate manner of implicitly converting an enum?\" and abstractly \"Is it appropriate to implicitly convert an enum?\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","silverlight-3.0"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6705,"score":5,"question_id":1793877,"title":"Silverlight application doesn't run.

Let's call the main app \"Silverlight4App\". I need to authenticate the users against a different database than the database where the rest of the data is stored. I have added an EF model to AppServices.Web, which is also where the authentication service currently resides. The Web.config file is in the main app, i.e. in Silverlight4App.  </p>\n\n<p>In the connectionStrings section of the web.config file, I originally had this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;add name=\"AuthEntities\" connectionString=\"metadata=res://*/AuthModel.csdl|res://*/AuthModel.ssdl|res://*/AuthModel.msl;provider=... /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I got the following error: </p>\n\n<p>\"Load operation failed for query 'GetUser'. Unable to load the specified metadata resource.\"</p>\n\n<p>Then I tried various things such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;add name=\"AuthEntities\" connectionString=\"metadata=..\\..\\bin\\AuthModel.csdl|..\\..\\bin\\AuthModel.ssdl|..\\..\\bin\\AuthModel.msl;provider=... /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and got this error:</p>\n\n<p>\"Load operation failed for query 'GetUser'. The specified metadata path is not valid. A valid path must be either an existing directory, an existing file with extension '.csdl', '.ssdl', or '.msl', or a URI that identifies an embedded resource.\" </p>\n\n<p>I also tried copying the metadata files to various locations. In the end, I got a little further with the following.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;add name=\"AuthEntities\" connectionString=\"metadata=~\\..\\..\\..\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.csdl|~\\..\\..\\..\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.ssdl|~\\..\\..\\..\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.msl;provider=... /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the above connection string, I got the following error:</p>\n\n<p>\"Load operation failed for query 'GetUser'. The supplied connection string is not valid, because it contains insufficient mapping or metadata information.\\r\\nParameter name: connectionString Inner exception message: Unable to determine application context. The ASP.NET application path could not be resolved.\" </p>\n\n<p>Well, at least it seems to have <em>found</em> the metadata files!  Out of frustration I finally tried simply hard-coding the entire path to the metadata files: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;add name=\"AuthEntities\" connectionString=\"metadata=C:\\Users\\...\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.csdl|C:\\Users\\...\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.ssdl|C:\\Users\\...\\Silverlight4App.Web\\Metadata\\AuthModel.msl;provider=... /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It worked perfectly!!
