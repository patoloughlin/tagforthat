There are multiple ways to authenticate, but for various reasons I want to have the user authenticate only once per session by doing an HTTP post to GeoServer's form-login processing page.  I intercept 404's from the web service (which is what GeoServer returns when the user requests a service not available for his/her login) and pop up a login dialog within Silverlight to get the username and password.  I then submit these credentials via HTTP POST to the login processing page.  All of this is working; the authentication succeeds and I'm sent a cookie with a JSESSIONID that will let me view the web service.</p>\n\n<p>But...</p>\n\n<p>The cookie doesn't seem to take effect until I force-refresh the Silverlight window.  So even though I get a successful login and get the cookie I need, when I try to reload the image without first reloading the page, the cookie is (apparently) not sent.  Is there any way that I can make the cookie take effect without reloading the page?  I thought maybe I needed to yield or something to let the browser finish processing the request before updating the image's Source property, but calling BeginInvoke with the image-refresh code in the delegate wasn't sufficient.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","xaml","storyboard"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13184736,"title":"Silverlight & AllowDeviceAccess Dialog Animation Timing Issue","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight object with a grid that has an image that 'blocks' the silverlight controls until the silverlight application has device access.

Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI have also tried creating the animation programatically to see if that would help.  I removed the storyboard from the xaml and create it in the code behind <strong>after</strong> the RequestDeviceAccess() returns true. c#:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (CaptureDeviceConfiguration.RequestDeviceAccess())\n        {\n            if (CaptureDeviceConfiguration.AllowedDeviceAccess)\n            {\n                Storyboard sb = new Storyboard();\n                DoubleAnimation da = new DoubleAnimation();\n                Storyboard.SetTarget(da, this.grdGetMic);\n                Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(da, new PropertyPath(Canvas.TopProperty));\n                da.Duration = new Duration(new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 5, 0));\n                da.To = -80;\n                sb.Children.Add(da);\n                sb.Begin();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And still after clicking yes on the allow devices dialog, the animation behaves like it started when I clicked the 'enable' button and not when I grant permissions in the device dialog.  The animation doesn't visibly start until I click 'Yes', but it jumps to where it would be had it started immediately.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","silverlight-4.0","richtextbox"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3897,"score":2,"question_id":3314754,"title":"How to import a .rtf file to silverlight 4 richtextbox?","body":"<p>I have a .rtf file and want to put it in a richtextbox in silverlight 4.

I don't understand why, since you can just use MemberwiseClone, so to me, those implementations are useless.</p>\n\n<p>Thank You.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio","silverlight","iis-express"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":99,"score":1,"question_id":13035402,"title":"\"No symbols have been loaded\" - Silverlight project cannot find pdb files","body":"<p>I've got a web project that runs a Silverlight app. Due to the massive build times I am trying to use \"Attach to Process\" instead of running in debug in Visual Studio.</p>\n\n<p>When I build the full solution I can attach fine, but when I make a change and build the changed project I get \"The breakpoint will not be currently hit.

My grid and chart are based on this demo example:  <a href=\"http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#Chart/Aggregates\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/#Chart/Aggregates</a>.  Basically, the grid compiles data and summarizes by Year, Quarter, Month, and then some other categories as well.  For the Month column, I tried two different methods (for sorting purposes, I have to use an integer or some date value for the month).  First, I just made Month an integer field and then used a converter mapped in the xaml for the 'Month' field to display 'JAN', 'FEB', etc.  This worked fine for the grid, but the chart would display 1, 2, etc. instead of the month abbreviation.  I researched this and was not able to come up with a solution to map the converter to the chart.  So, I tried making the Month field a datetime and then set the value to 1/1/1900, 2/1/1900, etc. and specified the format of the field to 'MMM' in the xaml for the grid.  I then used the following statement to set the the format in the chart when the user grouped by month:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SalesAnalysisChart.DefaultView.ChartArea.AxisX.DefaultLabelFormat = \"MMM\"; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This partially worked in that when the months were displayed across the x-axis they were labeled properly, but not when they appeared in the legend (the user, of course, can group by any of the columns which may or may not include month).  I've tried setting LegendItemLabelFormat, ItemLabelFormat, etc. but without success.  I'm not sure of the element on which to set the property.  I only need to change the default format for just the Month column - all other columns should display normally when grouped.  I also came across a class called 'LegendItemFormatConverter' which looks promising but I can't find any examples as to how to implement it.  I would actually prefer the converter method because the converter I wrote displays the month abbreviation in all caps, whereas the 'MMM' format displays in upper/lower case.  Here is the converter code that I originally used for the grid:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System; \nusing System.Net; \nusing System.Windows; \nusing System.Windows.Controls; \nusing System.Windows.Documents; \nusing System.Windows.Ink; \nusing System.Windows.Input; \nusing System.Windows.Media; \nusing System.Windows.Media.Animation; \nusing System.Windows.Shapes; \nusing System.Windows.Data; \n\nnamespace ApolloSL \n{ \n    public class MonthConverter : IValueConverter \n    { \n        public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter,     System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) \n        { \n            if (value != null) \n            {  \n                DateTime date = new DateTime(1900, (Int32)value, 1); \n                return date.ToString(\"MMM\").ToUpper(); \n            } \n            else\n            { return \"\"; } \n        } \n\n        public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) \n        { \n            return value.ToString(); \n        } \n    } \n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please help...</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance,</p>\n\n<p>Bryan</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","runtime","winrt","portable-class-library"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":1,"question_id":13170024,"title":"How to determine .net platform at runtime from portable library?","body":"<p>Specifically I want to be able to determine at runtime when portable class library code is running on Silverlight, WinRT, or .NET</p>\n\n<p>My best idea right now is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typeof(object).Assembly.GetCustomAttribute&lt;AssemblyProductAttribute&gt;().Product\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On .NET it returns \"Microsoft® .NET Framework\" and on Silverlight it returns \"Microsoft® Silverlight\"  but I'm not sure if it distinguishes itself on WinRT as I'm not developing with Windows 8 at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>So I'd like to know if that works or any better ideas.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","slider","mediaelement"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":440,"score":1,"question_id":4717309,"title":"Silverlight MediaElement Position with generated WAV (performance)","body":"<p>I have tied a MediaElement control to a Slider control.<br />\nI am getting my stream from a binary field in a SQL Server database.<br />\nI am concerned that there may be some performance issues due to the following:<br />\n1.

Let's say that I make a change to the firstname (and change nothing else at all, so no changes to any age bit), then during the submit process the set method will be fired, and so a value set to age.</p>\n\n<p>I only want the set method to be used when a user actually types a value into the table.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas why this is being called? I've trying removing the column for GuessedAge in the Datagrid, just to check it's not a datagrid issue. Still the set method is called when there's no UI elements bound to GuessadAge.</p>\n\n<p>Also any ideas how to stop this being called?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","https","download","windows-phone"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13140894,"title":"Download a file over HTTPS in Windows phone","body":"<p>Is it possible to download a file over Https in Windows phone , post method with username and password , I tried this code but it returns an error.\nNote that the urlLink is an \"https://\" Link.</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Uri uri = new Uri(urlLink);\n        HttpWebRequest r = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(uri);\n        r.ContentType = \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\";\n        r.Method = \"POST\";\n        string parameters = \"username=admin&amp;password=123\";\n        r.BeginGetRequestStream(delegate(IAsyncResult req)\n        {\n            var outStream = r.EndGetRequestStream(req);\n\n            using (StreamWriter w = new StreamWriter(outStream))\n              w.Write(parameters);\n\n            r.BeginGetResponse(delegate(IAsyncResult result)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)r.EndGetResponse(result);\n\n                    using (var stream = response.GetResponseStream())\n                    {\n                        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream))\n                        {\n\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                catch (Exception exc)\n                {\n                    string ee = exc.Message;\n\n                }\n            }, null);\n        }, null);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Error :</p>\n\n<p>The remote server returned an error: NotFound.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","silverlight"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":13141685,"title":"How to get items in a specific range (3 - 7) from list?","body":"<p>What would be the most efficient way to select all the items in a specific range from a list and put it in a new one?</p>\n\n<p>List xmlList = new List();</p>\n\n<p>This is my List, and I would like to put all the DataClass items between the range (3 - 7) in a new List.</p>\n\n<p>What would be the most efficient way?

Because the graphics engine is relatively simple, you get to spend your time building features into the game and it's possible for one person to quickly build something fun.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a typical screen might look something like this (the @ is the player, # is a wall, the other characters are things like monsters, stairs, and items):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thangorodrim.net/graphics/dumps/dump2.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm an experienced ASP.Net dev and I'm just getting started with Silverlight. Is there a particular approach I should take for this? </p>\n\n<p>To provide some background, in Winforms, most standard approaches are too slow  -- the text ends up updating with a visible, ugly blink. I'm thinking something to do with the Canvas might be appropriate, but even better would be to somehow draw a screen into a buffer and then instantly flip that onto the screen so that it becomes visible instantly. </p>\n\n<p>But I don't really want to mess around with DirectX right now - I'm hoping WPF can get me to where I need to be without a big learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n\n<p><b>Update:</b> So this turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried a lot of different approaches and I was finally able to get it to actually render fast enough, but I think that to make it blazing hot fast you should probably build a sprite map of the font you want to use and work from that instead of trying to use any of the built in font rendering stuff. I didn't do that.</p>\n\n<p>When I got the core rendering engine done, I ended up with some annoying artifacts related to quirks of font rendering (even fixed width fonts are sometimes a liiitle bit wide...), and when I finally worked that out I discovered <a href=\"http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">libtcod</a>, which is a very impressive roguelike engine that has a C# wrapper. That's all console based.

Using fiddler, e.g., the XML generated has a bunch of clutter that I don't really NEED just to populate this ComboBox.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of ONE record being brought back of type Employee.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>   ----------------------------- \n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?&gt;\n&lt;feed xml:base=\"http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/\" xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices\" xmlns:m=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"&gt;\n  &lt;title type=\"text\"&gt;Employees&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;id&gt;http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/Employees&lt;/id&gt;\n  &lt;updated&gt;2011-11-09T23:41:01Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"self\" title=\"Employees\" href=\"Employees\" /&gt;\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;http://localhost/HumanResourcesService.svc/Employees('54924')&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;title type=\"text\"&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;updated&gt;2011-11-09T23:41:01Z&lt;/updated&gt;\n    &lt;author&gt;\n      &lt;name /&gt;\n    &lt;/author&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"edit\" title=\"Employee\" href=\"Employees('54924')\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/EmployeeTypes\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"EmployeeTypes\" href=\"Employees('54924')/EmployeeTypes\" /&gt; \n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Locations\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Locations\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Locations\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Buildings\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Buildings\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Buildings\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Managers\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Managers\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Managers\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/Assignments\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=feed\" title=\"Assignments\" href=\"Employees('54924')/Assignments\" /&gt;\n    // ********************************************\n    // MANY MORE LINKS - REMOVED FOR BREVITY\n    // ********************************************        \n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/xxx\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"xxx\" href=\"Employees('54924')/xxx\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/yyy\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"yyy\" href=\"Employees('54924')/yyy\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/related/zzz\" type=\"application/atom+xml;type=entry\" title=\"zzz\" href=\"Employees('54924')/zzz\" /&gt;\n    &lt;category term=\"xxx.HumanResources.Employee\" scheme=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/scheme\" /&gt;\n    &lt;content type=\"application/xml\"&gt;\n      &lt;m:properties&gt;\n        &lt;d:EmpNo m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;54924&lt;/d:EmpNo&gt;\n        &lt;d:FirstName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;John&lt;/d:FirstName&gt;\n        &lt;d:LastName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Hughes&lt;/d:LastName&gt;\n        &lt;d:MiddleName m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Michael&lt;/d:MiddleName&gt;\n        &lt;d:Salary m:type=\"Edm.Decimal\"&gt;20000&lt;/d:Salary&gt;\n        &lt;d:Notes m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;Anything...&lt;/d:Notes&gt;\n        &lt;d:PrimaryPhone m:type=\"Edm.String\"&gt;984-875-4545&lt;/d:PrimaryPhone&gt;\n        &lt;d:StartDate m:type=\"Edm.DateTime\"&gt;1977-02-01T00:00:00&lt;/d:StartDate&gt;\n        &lt;d:EndDate m:type=\"Edm.DateTime\"&gt;1995-12-31T00:00:00&lt;/d:EndDate&gt;\n        // ********************************************\n        // MANY MORE PROPERTIES - REMOVED FOR BREVITY\n        // ********************************************\n        &lt;d:AnotherFieldX m:type=\"Edm.Double\" m:null=\"true\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/m:properties&gt;\n    &lt;/content&gt;\n  &lt;/entry&gt;\n&lt;/feed&gt;\n\n-----------------------------\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, I don't need all that junk like those LINKS and this is just ONE entity.

But as soon as I do, my <code>GapPanel</code> crashes in its <code>MeasureOverride</code> method. But only when the <code>ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility</code> is set to <code>Auto</code>, <code>Visible</code> or <code>Hidden</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I think the ScrollViewer calls somewhere <code>child.Measure(availableSize)</code>, either. When the horizontal scroll bar is available, the available <em>horizontal</em> space isn't e.g. 1150, it's <code>double.PositiveInfinity</code>. Now I try to calculate the <code>availableSizeForChildren</code> in my <code>MeasureOverride</code> method and something like this happens:</p>\n\n<pre><code>double.PositiveInfinity - (double.PositiveInfinity - 1120) = not defined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if I call <code>child.Measure(sizeWithANotDefinedValue)</code> I get an exception.</p>\n\n<p>So how could I get around this? I really need this behaviour, which is implemented in code. Actually there is another custom panel wrapped around the scroll viewer. <em>A kind of <strong>hack</strong> works</em>: what we do is, we save the available space of the parent (custom) panel of the <code>ScrollViewer</code> in a static field (which hasn't any <code>double.PositiveInfinity</code> values). At the moment we access this value in the <code>MeasureOverride</code> method of the panel, which is actually contained in the <code>Children</code> of the <code>ScrollViewer</code>. This is really <strong>ugly</strong> and <strong>hacky</strong>, isn't it? Because actually we don't use the availableSpace the <code>ScrollViewer</code> offers, we just access a static variable, which might contain everything.</p>\n\n<p>I think the ugly thing about this is that there are dependencies between two different panels. I'd really like not doing this.</p>\n\n<p>Or is a <code>ScrollViewer</code> in general the wrong approach? If it is, how to get the panel scrollable without a <code>ScrollViewer</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","silverlight","xaml"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":1,"question_id":13016932,"title":"How to create a style based on default style?","body":"<p>How to create a style based on default style in Silverlight?</p>\n\n<p>For example, in WPF we make it like:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;Style TargetType=\"{x:Type TextBox}\" BasedOn=\"{StaticResource {x:Type TextBox}}\"&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Margin\" Value=\"2\" /&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=\"Padding\" Value=\"2\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":165,"score":2,"question_id":7245628,"title":"Update ValidationSummary after UpdateSource","body":"<p>I'm forcing an update of every textBox in a silverlight page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.txtName.GetBindingExpression(TextBox.TextProperty).UpdateSource();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works fine (the textbox shows its error, etc...) but ValidationSummary is not refreshed...</p>\n\n<p>Any idea??</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>After some tests I've realized it was because ValidationSummary wasn't loaded yet.

It flips the canvas upside down and lowers it 200 down to adjust to root canvas position. Given taht Logo looks ok when rendered means that all graphic elements in the xaml are actually upside down :). Maybe its an AI thing, I don't know. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that I now use Blend to convert this canvas into a GraphicBrush. The blend omits the transform and the logo looks upiside down when brush is applied. Rather then again transforming at each brush recipient I was thinking that maybe we should just fix it at the root, e.g. convert all paths so that they render properly to begin with avoiding a need for root transform.</p>\n\n<p>Question: is there a programmatic (or any other way) to do this? Meaning, can I render this canvas and then serialize a rendered (after all transforms applied) DOM into an XAML? </p>\n\n<p>Or to make  the question clearer: there are two transforms applied to each path (as seen above, one global flip and one local shift for each path), can I somehow apply those transforms to each path/its points so that paths render without them.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","silverlight","windows-phone-7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":319,"score":4,"question_id":10930642,"title":"RichTextBox maximum size limitation?","body":"<p>In my Windows Phone application I use RichTextBox to display a content.

However, if I shutdown and reload, the state code value doesn't bind from the entity to the UI and the combo shows nothing selected. Then, of course, a subsequent save nulls the entity's state value.</p>\n\n<p>I want this very simple since I want to display state codes and save state codes (I don't want to display the full state name). So I don't want to have to muck with creating a State class that has Code and FullName properties and avoid having to use the SelectedValuePath and DisplayMemberPath properties of the combobox.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nAdded to the code how ProjectModel does change notification. Note that the ProjectEntity class does this too. Trust me, it works. I've left it out because it also inherits from an Entity base class that does change notification through reflection. TwoWay binding works on everything but for the combobox.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","sharepoint","sharepoint2010","silverlight-5.0","sharepoint-clientobject"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":12907490,"title":"How to create a new document from a Document Template using Client Object Model","body":"<p>I require to create a programatically create a new document using the Document Template URL of the document Library and this requires to be done using the Client Object Model.

We had to be able to send post data to the page the ReportViewer is on so a little bit of javascript had to be added in to actually open the page.  </p>\n\n<p>Most of the info online talks about just adding the line ReportViewerCtrl.reset() and it should work but for me it makes absolutely no difference.  I'm fairly confident the code will explain the situation better but if you need more details about the set up, please, just ask.  </p>\n\n<p>So... from the beginning... the hyperlink button for the report calls this on click:  <code>HtmlPage.Window.Invoke(\"showAspPage\", par);</code></p>\n\n<p>That calls this script (I have cut out everything that handles the report parameters and stuff because it works just the same when that data is excluded anyway):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nvar g_htmlWindow;\n\nfunction showAspPage(param) {\n    var to = param[\"to\"];\n    var myForm = document.createElement(\"form\");\n    myForm.method = \"post\";\n    myForm.action = to;\n    myForm.setAttribute(\"target\", \"_blank\");  \n\n    //handle parameters here\n\n    document.body.appendChild(myForm);\n    myForm.submit();\n    document.body.removeChild(myForm);\n }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>param[\"to\"]</code> is the link to the page the actual <code>ReportViewer</code> control is on... so from the aspx portion of that page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n        &lt;asp:ScriptManager ID=\"ScriptManager1\" runat=\"server\"&gt; &lt;/asp:ScriptManager&gt;\n        &lt;rsweb:ReportViewer ID=\"ReportViewer4\" runat=\"server\"&gt; &lt;/rsweb:ReportViewer&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the important chunk from the aspx.cs portion of the <code>ReportViewer</code> page... (might be over-kill on setting properties and such but I've added a lot of stuff while trying out what suggestions I found on the web)</p>\n\n<pre><code>ReportViewer4.Reset();  \nReportViewer4.ShowCredentialPrompts = false;\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportServerCredentials = new ReportCredentials();\nReportViewer4.ProcessingMode = Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms.ProcessingMode.Remote;\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportServerUrl = reportServerURL\nReportViewer4.AsyncRendering = false;\n\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.ReportPath = reportPath;\nReportViewer4.KeepSessionAlive = true; \n\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.SetParameters(params);\n\nReportViewer4.SizeToReportContent = true; \nReportViewer4.Width = Unit.Pixel(900);\nReportViewer4.ServerReport.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I only want to see one report, everything works fine - everything is set up correctly.  But, when I want to call <code>HtmlPage.Window.Invoke(\"showAspPage\", par);</code> twice in a row for two different reports I start getting this error either when one of the reports loads or when you try and change the report parameters in either of the two reports:  <strong>ASP.NET session has expired or could not be found</strong> Both reports load 95% of the time - with parameters, data, everything; one report always loads but it depends on which one finishes loading first; but you can't change the parameters without that error.</p>\n\n<p>So.... as a slight alternative, in this situation, the ability to change the report isn't actually needed and I could do a direct export to PDF but with scripting involved you can't simply add \"rs:Format=PDF\" to the end of the report path.  However, if the parameters are visible, they need to work if changed.  I guess I could hide the whole parameter section?  But it still doesn't solve the issue of getting the error when the report loads sometimes....</p>\n\n<p>Also.... might be entirely unrelated, but the parameters are encrypted and I have to get the salt and hash from the database (Entity Framework and WCF RIA Services) before I call HtmlPage.Window.Invoke.... I find this kind of weird.... but, after the report screen loads, if the user sits there and doesn't click on anything (but doesn't sit there long enough to actually be logged out, maybe just 5 min or so), I get this error:\n<strong>'Load operation failed for query 'GetStuff'. The remote server returned an error: Not Found.'</strong> but again, it works fine if clicked right away.

But in practice that isn't true at all: when I set a font height (and line height) of 22 with a common font like Lucida Sans Unicode, the actual height between lines is 33 pixels.  (Actually, 33 and a fraction.)</p>\n\n<p>To work around this, I tried doing what I had done in Java applets: use font metrics to ask how tall my text actually is.  The only way to do this that I found is to render the sample text into an offscreen TextBlock, Measure it, and see how tall it ends up.  It returned a very handy answer: 32 pixels.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this is ALMOST correct.  The onscreen TextBlock rendered the font 33 pixels high, and the offscreen one rendered it 32 pixels high.  The only way to measure my text accurately turned out to be to put the \"offscreen\" block onscreen, transparent and behind the real onscreen one.  Then the measurement returns 33.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?  Why does everybody say the height is in pixels, but I find that the number here represents an actual height measured in pixel-and-a-halfs, and furthermore the exact ratio varies depending on whether the control is part of the active page or is detached and self-sufficient?  What am I not understanding??</p>\n\n<p><em>Added note</em>: I am aware of the difference between the height occupied by a row of text and the height of the actual glyphs.  But the same documentation that says the font height is in pixels also says that the line height is in pixels, and defaults to being the same as the font height.  This clearly implies that the font height is supposed to include all vertical space used, not just the glyph heights.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Final note</em>: I think my problem in the end is that I keep running into misinformation about silverlight, and then forgetting where I read it, so I get it mixed up with the accurate information.  Like, where was it that I read that Canvas stretches to hold its content?  It doesn't.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","crystal-reports"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2892,"score":2,"question_id":5415782,"title":"Using Crystal reports with Silverlight 4","body":"<p>I am using Silverlight to design my web application and want to server up PDF reports to customers.

(Haven't tried IE10 yet.)</p>\n\n<p>In the IE9 case, the Silverlight object appears as expected, but the dropdown menu collapses as soon as the mouse touches the displayed Silverlight object.  I.e., the CSS3 menu loses sight of the mouse and the dropdown collapses the moment the mouse pointer touches the Silverlight object.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been able to find much in the way of help for this one.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or guidance are much appreciated.  Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","multiple","amchart","linegraph"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":127,"score":0,"question_id":12804349,"title":"Amcharts SerialChart multiple line graphs different category value member paths (Silverlight)","body":"<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I rewrote my question to make it more understandable after the conversation below with Tony (thanks!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>GOAL</strong> Render multiple line graphs (let's say 2) in the same chart. The charts have different x/y value pairs. For one x-value, I do not know both y-values.</p>\n\n<p>I am using Silverlight. The classes available for this are <code>SerialChart</code> and <code>LineGraph</code>. The data source for both graphs is the same and is set at the <code>SerialChart</code> level. The name of the property for the x-axis is also defined there for both graphs (<code>CategoryValueMemberPath</code>).</p>\n\n<p>As suggested by the amCharts documentation, we need to create objects that have a property for the category axis (x-axis) and then one property per graph. Let's call them \"Graph1\" and \"Graph2\". So the data source looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;MyClass&gt; data = new List&lt;MyClass&gt;()\n{\n   new MyClass() { Category = 0.1, Graph1 = 0.14, Graph2 = ??? }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.15, Graph1 = ???, Graph2 = 0.05 }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.2, Graph1 = 0.35, Graph2 = ??? }\n  ,new MyClass() { Category = 0.18, Graph1 = ???, Graph2 = 0.12 }\n  ... and so on ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong> What am I supposed to do about the \"???\" values? I do not have the actual value for that graph for that category value.</p>\n\n<p>If I do not set a value, the default value of 0.0 is assumed and it draws a spike to the x-axis. If I set the previously known Graph1/Graph2 value, then it creates a horizontal connection where there is not supposed to be one. I am basically altering the graph which leads to a wrong result.</p>\n\n<p>So how do I solve this?

The communication between them is through a pollingDuplexHttpBinding.\nSuppose the server wants to sent to the client a message which its size is larger than the set MaxBufferSize and MaxReceivedMessageSize. What is going behind the scenes in that case?</p>\n\n<p>Now, here is my actual experience with this issue:\nThe binding configuration on the server-side:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;binding name=\"eventServiceBinding\" sendTimeout=\"00:00:10\" inactivityTimeout=\"24:00:00\" receiveTimeout=\"24:00:00\" serverPollTimeout = \"00:01:00\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Send a large (i.e. larger than the value set in client's binding's properties as described above) message from the server to the client. Then, send a second (not large) message => I got a send timeout for the second message (I don't know if the client ever got the first message).\nI've tried to search for some helpful logging in order to see what happens with the first message. Done it both in the server side (by activating the WCF logger) and on the client side (by using Fidler). I've found nothing really interesting in the log (but maybe I didn't search in the correct places).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover - when sendTimeout is set to large value (say 10 minutes), it looks like all additional messages sent from server to client are \"stuck\" - never received by the client and no exceptions are thrown until the send timeout is reached. In addition, I experience  a strange phenomenon in which no communication between any client and any service exposed by the hosting IIS application is working - until I reset IIS. I am not 100% sure though that this is related to the previous problem described here.</p>\n\n<p>Setting the MaxBufferSize and MaxReceivedMessageSize properties in the client side's binding seems to resolve both issues.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you have any experience with such issue and whether you can tell what's actually is going behind the scenes  within WCF here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","silverlight","clr"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":415,"score":0,"question_id":2760549,"title":"C++ to bytecode compiler for Silverlight CLR?","body":"<p>I'd like to be able to compile a C/C++ library so that it runs within a safe managed runtime in the Silverlight CLR.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine#C_to_bytecode_compilers\" rel=\"nofollow\">several tools</a> for doing this with the JVM that allows C++ code to run within a CRT emulation layer (see <a href=\"http://nestedvm.ibex.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NestedVM</a>, <a href=\"http://da.vidr.cc/projects/lljvm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LLJVM</a>, etc), which effectively allows C++ code to be run within a Java Applet.

However this solution is not good enough for daily use.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","silverlight-4.0","silverlight-toolkit"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12781483,"title":"SilverLight RichTextBox rendering","body":"<p>Well</p>\n\n<p>I made Custom Control(richtextbox)</p>\n\n<p>problem is that can not render in xaml after saving, somthing like this displayed (xaml code)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Section xml:space=\"preserve\" HasTrailingParagraphBreakOnPaste=\"False\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontSize=\"11\" FontFamily=\"/NRA.ClientLibrary;component/Fonts/Fonts.zip#BPG Glaho\" Foreground=\"#FF000000\" FontWeight=\"Normal\" FontStyle=\"Normal\" FontStretch=\"Normal\" CharacterSpacing=\"0\" Typography.AnnotationAlternates=\"0\" ........ \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that my RichTextBox look like this ...</p>\n\n<p>\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n            </p>\n\n<pre><code>        &lt;ComboBox SelectionChanged=\"cmbFontSizes_SelectionChanged\"  Width=\"45\"&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"8\" Tag=\"8\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"9\" Tag=\"9\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"10\" Tag=\"10\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"11\" Tag=\"11\" IsSelected=\"True\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"12\" Tag=\"12\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"14\" Tag=\"14\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"16\" Tag=\"16\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"18\" Tag=\"18\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"20\" Tag=\"20\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"22\" Tag=\"22\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"24\" Tag=\"24\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"26\" Tag=\"26\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"28\" Tag=\"28\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"36\" Tag=\"36\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"48\" Tag=\"48\"/&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"72\" Tag=\"72\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\n\n        &lt;ComboBox SelectedIndex=\"0\" SelectionChanged=\"cmbFontColors_SelectionChanged\" Width=\"55\"&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FFFF0000\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Red\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF008000\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Green\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF0000FF\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Blue\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FFFFFF00\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Yellow\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n            &lt;ComboBoxItem Tag=\"FF000000\" IsSelected=\"True\"&gt;\n                &lt;Rectangle Width=\"22\" Height=\"14\" Fill=\"Black\" Margin=\"2,0,0,0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/ComboBoxItem&gt;\n        &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\n\n        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\"&gt;\n\n            &lt;!--Font Formatting Buttons--&gt;\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnBold\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnBold_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"B\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\" FontSize=\"14\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnItalic\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnItalic_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"I\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\" FontSize=\"14\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n\n            &lt;Button x:Name=\"btnUnderline\" Padding=\"5 0\" Click=\"btnUnderline_Click\"&gt;\n                &lt;TextBlock Text=\"U\" FontWeight=\"Bold\" FontFamily=\"Georgia\"  FontSize=\"14\" TextDecorations=\"Underline\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/Button&gt;\n        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n    &lt;ScrollViewer x:Name=\"scrollViewer\" VerticalScrollBarVisibility=\"Auto\" Padding=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;RichTextBox x:Name=\"richTextBox\" ContentChanged=\"richTextBox_ContentChanged\" AcceptsReturn=\"True\" TextWrapping=\"Wrap\" Height=\"75\" Background=\"Transparent\" BorderThickness=\"0\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Code Behind</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string Text\n{\n    get { return (string)GetValue(TextProperty);

How can I free them?","body":"<p>I am having a strange behavior that I believe is related to the Binding. Basically, I suspect that the binding of my controls on my ViewModel creates a strong reference from the PropertyChanged event to the control. So the ViewModel always keeps a reference to the controls. Therefore, even though I am done with the controls, they are always kept in memory. This will remain until I destroy my ViewModel, but in my case, I have one ViewModel for everything. Is there a way I can unhook the events created by the bindings?</p>\n\n<p>Here is a more detailed explanation of my issue, and the one that lead me to the above belief:</p>\n\n<p>I have a ViewModel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ViewModel()\n{\n    InitializeCommands();\n}\n\npublic ICommand OpenPropertiesCommand { get; set; }\n\nprivate void InitializeCommands()\n{\n    OpenPropertiesCommand = new DelegateCommand((o) =&gt;\n    {\n        OpenProperties(o as ContentControl);\n    });\n}\n\nprivate void OpenProperties(ContentControl propertiesWindowOwner)\n{\n    JobProperties jp = new JobProperties(this);\n    jp.WindowStartupLocation = Telerik.Windows.Controls.WindowStartupLocation.CenterOwner;\n    jp.Owner = propertiesWindowOwner;\n    jp.ShowDialog();\n}\n\nprivate Job selectedJob;\npublic Job SelectedJob\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return selectedJob;\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        selectedJob = value;\n        RaisePropertyChanged(\"SelectedJob\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ViewModel is used by my Main control. On this control, I have a GridView where each Row is a \"Job\". You can edit Job's properties, which will in turn open a RadWindow Control that lets you edit each job's properties.</p>\n\n<p>My PropertyEdit Control is a RadWindow that uses the same ViewModel as it's DataContext. All of it's components bind on SelectedJob.something where something is a property of Job.</p>\n\n<p>If I open Job #1 properties. A PropertyEdit control is created and binding is established. My properties SelectedJob.something are getting accessed once for each binding as should be. If I close the PropertyEdit control and open Job #1 properties again. One more PropertyEdit control is created and binding is established. Now if I close this one, and select another Job, a PropertyChanged event is called on selectedJob and my bindings are called twice for each binding. In effect, the first PropertyEdit control binding are activated, and the second PropertyEdit bindings are also activated. Now if I opened Job #1 properties 100 times, when I select Job #2, bindings will be queried 100 times for each one of them. Therefore, I suspect a memory leak, where the bindings are keeping my PropertyEdit control in memory, because they hold a reference to all of them. Until I destroy my ViewModel, those references will be kept, but in my case, it is my Main app's ViewModel, and will never be destroyed. How can I prevent this from happening? Is there a way I can unregister the binding's events manually?</p>\n\n<p>Thank You.</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","datagrid"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12747937,"title":"Silverlight DataGrid - How to put cell in edit mode via command?","body":"<p>I have a datagrid, and we need to do some re-ordering of the items, UI is setup so that on each row there a icon for reordering.

However, I feel this is very ugly and has unnecessary excess code+logic floating around. I am hoping the HTTP Cache headers have a work around similar to the one that I am having.

(*)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The * part of this is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(*) This true in 99.9% case.  There is another rule about the visibility of the default constructor of a class (which we'll get into next week when we dig deeper into the security model), which also requires that the base class' default constructor (if it has one), must be transparent as well.  Practically speaking, you're not generally going to find interesting transparent types in the platform which do not also have transparent default constructors, so this rule doesn't normally come into play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is, however, one such interesting transparent type which does not have a transparent default constructor - the WebClient class. There's also a good reason to want to subclass it - to override GetWebRequest to provide support for cookies.</p>\n\n<p>As a test, I've tried the following both with and without the constructor attribute...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyWebClient : WebClient\n{\n    [SecuritySafeCritical] // matches the attribute on the base class ctor\n    public MyWebClient() { }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but get the following error either way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inheritance security rules violated while overriding member: 'MyWebClient..ctor()'. Security accessibility of the overriding method must match the security accessibility of the method being overriden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It looks to me like this is the 0.1% case that he mentions.

And if I changed each of the 3 100x100 buttons to be 200x200, I would want the ScrollViewer to get 200x200, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Pavlo's example gets me the closest so far, with the Grid rows/columns appropriately sized, but ScrollViewer does not adapt to the Size given to it when Arrange is called.

Is there an easy way to call these web services in silverlight as non-async? Also, I'm about to test this myself, but what issues are there with sending web service arguments by reference? Especially when done async.</p>\n\n<p>I've got a big stack of legacy asmx web services. I have a little utility in WPF that accesses a few and I'd like to move it over to the web. I decided to use Silverlight since, while I've never used it before, it supposedly uses most of the same markup as WPF and should be easy to port over. The web services, on the other hand, don't seem to be handled the same way.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I noticed is, when I import it into silverlight, the handy \"Add Service Reference -> Advanced -> Add Web Reference\" isn't there, so I had to add it through the direct link there on the \"Add Service Reference\" window. The next thing I noticed is, when I try and call the web service, I can't just run it and get a return since only the async method is appearing. That can be useful, sure, but most of the web service calls are things where you have to stop and directly wait for a return, so most of the time it's kind of pointless. On top of that, I don't even know how to get the return value from the function now.</p>\n\n<p>In searching around I find most links talking about WCF services on Silverlight, is there anyone out there that can shine some light on using some legacy asmx?

The solutions there do not apply to Silverlight because in Silverlight you cannot set the Width property to a number of pixels. </p>\n\n<p>I have a datagrid within an AutoCompleteBox control - the user starts typing a search term and a grid pops up. I wrote a class called AutoComplete which inherits from AutoCompleteBox and contains a DataGridSelectionAdapter (substituting for ListBox). The AutoComplete class populates the grid using data from a query to a web service. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is with the sizing of the columns. The column widths are all set to Auto. The first time a search term is typed in, the columns size properly to fit the contents of the cells. But if another term is then typed in and the grid has smaller contents, the columns never reduce in size. Over multiple searches, the grid gets bigger if it needs to, but then it never goes back to being smaller. </p>\n\n<p>I've looked everywhere for solutions, but they are all WPF-specific - the Silverlight DataGridColumn class does not have a WidthProperty dependency property; it only has ActualWidth, which is read-only.

This seems to me to be a showstopper for automating out-of-process COM servers such as Excel.</p>\n\n<p>A surprising ommission, all the more so as Pete Brown in section 5.5 of his book \"Silverlight 4 in Action\" goes as far as to say about <code>AutomationFactory.CreateObject</code>, that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The primary intent of this feature is to allow automation of other applications, including Microsoft Office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> in response to Hans' comments.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not convinced the \"silent assassin\" problem exists in typical automation of Office apps.  A common use might look something like the following, which I've seen used repeatedly in WinForms applications without ever coming across the \"poisoned RCW\" described in the article linked by Hans:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create an Excel.Application instance</li>\n<li>Open or create a workbook</li>\n<li>Write data to the workbook</li>\n<li>Show Excel if all went well, close the workbook and call Application.Quit if not.</li>\n<li>Call Marshal.ReleaseComObject to release all Excel object references.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Failing to call Marshal.ReleaseComObject as recommended by Hans will leave multiple copies of Excel.exe running, as described in the KB article mentioned above - highly undesirable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The sample I'm using to repro this is a sample from the source code for Pete Brown's book Silverlight 4 in action, there's a download link on this page.  The sample solution AutomatingExcel is in Ch05.zip / 5.03.  To repro:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure no instances of Excel are running</li>\n<li>Run AutomatingExcel sample</li>\n<li>An Excel workbook is opened</li>\n<li>Close Excel</li>\n<li>Observe with Task Manager that Excel is still running.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Setting all the dynamic variables to null and calling GC.Collect() seems to work as pointed out in AnthonyWJones's answer.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Otaku's answer is what I was looking for - by wrapping references in a using statement the COM references are released without the need to call GC.Collect.  A bit of experimentation shows that it's more tolerant of failing to dispose every single reference, unlike the standard <code>Marshal.ReleaseComObject</code> solution described in the KB article referenced above.</p>\n\n<p>It would be interesting to have an authoritative take on exactly what must be disposed to ensure that all Excel references are released.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":12640936,"title":"How do you handle Expired WCF Session in a single location in the Silverlight client?","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight client which consumes a wcf service through the ServiceReference that was auto-generated with VisualStudio.</p>\n\n<p>In case the user has left his computer idle and the WCF session has expired, then the WCF service will respond to any call with a specific error message that can be recognized on the client like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(e.Error.Message == \"SessionExpired\"){\n   //redirect to login page\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Up to this point everything is fine. </p>\n\n<p>Now my problem is that I have to copy paste this session checking code in all the completedEventHandlers in the entire client. \nHow could I avoid this?

I have this strange issue on Silverlight MVVM pattern using IDataErrorInfo. It's my first question made here in StackOverflow, so I hope I manage to explain it correctly. Here's the deal:</p>\n\n<p>I Have this huge Job Register ChildWindow that has some controls that should only be enabled if a checkbox called HasPrevision is checked. The idea is: if the job has a Prevision, then all the controls related to the prevision are Enabled, otherwise, they are Disabled.\nNow, if there is a prevision, the user MUST choose a Prevision Type in the PrevisionType ComboBox. So, if the HasPrevision checkbox is CHECKED, the PrevisionType must be selected, but if the HasPrevision checkbox is NOT CHECKED, the PrevisionType comboBox can be left unselected.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the XAML for those controls (I won't show all the xaml here because it's rather big, but I believe that the problem can be solved just by showing those lines):</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- The HasPrevision CheckBox --&gt;\n&lt;CheckBox Grid.Column=\"1\"\n  Grid.Row=\"3\"\n  x:Name=\"cbxHasPrevision\"\n  IsChecked=\"{Binding SelectedJob.HasPrevision, Mode=TwoWay}\"\n  Margin=\"0,20,2,0\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- The PrevisionType ComboBox --&gt;\n&lt;telerik:RadComboBox Grid.Column=\"1\"\n  Grid.Row=\"4\"\n  x:Name=\"cmbPrevisionType\"\n  IsEnabled=\"{Binding HasPrevision, Converter={StaticResource ControlesCadastroProcessoConverter}, ConverterParameter=IsEnabled}\"\n  ItemsSource=\"{Binding PrevisionTypeList, Mode=OneWay}\"                             \n  SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedJob.PrevisionType , Mode=TwoWay, NotifyOnValidationError=True, ValidatesOnDataErrors=True, ValidatesOnExceptions=True, ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors=True}\"\n  Margin=\"0,4,48,4\"\n  Height=\"22\"\n  DisplayMemberPath=\"DsPrevisionType\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, the HasPrevision and the PrevisionType properties are binded to a property in my ViewModel called SelectedJob. SelectedJob is a Job object. All I want to do is use the IDataErrorInfo interface in my Job Class to identify if the PrevisionType is selected. Now, I can only require a PrevisionType if the HasPrevision property is \"true\", so my job class has this code for the IDataErrorInfo:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public string this[string columnName]\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            switch (columnName)\n            {\n                case \"PrevisionType\":                      \n                    if (HasPrevision &amp;&amp; (PrevisionType== null))\n                        return \"Select a PrevisionType\";\n                    break;\n            }\n            return null;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>    }</h2>\n\n<p>This sounds very logical to me. When I debug the code, it actually works: the switch identifies the columnName, it enters the case \"PrevisionType\" and it actually runs the return code inside the If statement returning the error message, not the default \"return null\" clause. But the error message don't show the error! Even worse: the combo box wont event validate automatically.\nWhen the \"Save\" button is clicked, I check for errors and set the PrevisionType comboBox to the InvalidFocused state. The comboBox DOES get the red border around it indicating that it is in an error state, but the error message is blank. When I hover my mouse of the control, an empty small red box appears, with nothing on it. </p>\n\n<p>Even more weird than that: if I REMOVE the \"HasPrevision\" check from the IF statement, leaving the code as follow, the message is shown and the control is validated automatically!!!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public string this[string columnName]\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            switch (columnName)\n            {\n                case \"PrevisionType\":                      \n                    if (PrevisionType== null)\n                        return \"Select a PrevisionType\";\n                    break;\n            }\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Everything I can think of is that since I'm trying to validate a property based on another property value, somewhere in the middle of the set's and get's the Silverlight environment gets \"confused\"? I don't know, I've been trying to find a solution for this for 2 days with no success. \nHere are some of the other codes that I believe that are relevant. </p>\n\n<p>The properties in my Job Class:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>    private bool _HasPrevision;\n    [DataMember]\n    public bool HasPrevision\n    {\n        get { return _HasPrevision; }\n        set\n        {\n            _HasPrevision= value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(\"HasPrevision\");\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    private PrevisionType.PrevisionType _PrevisionType { get; set; }\n    [DataMember]\n    public PrevisionType.PrevisionType PrevisionType\n    {\n        get { return _PrevisionType; }\n        set\n        {\n            _PrevisionType = value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(\"PrevisionType\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My SelectedJob property in my ViewModel is:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>public const string SelectedJobPropertyName = \"SelectedJob\";\n    private Objects.Register.Job.Job _SelectedJob = null;\n    public Objects.Register.Job.Job SelectedJob\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _SelectedJob;\n        }\n\n        set\n        {\n            if (_SelectedJob == value)\n                return;\n\n            var oldValue = _SelectedJob;\n            _SelectedJob = value;\n            RaisePropertyChanged(SelectedJobPropertyName , oldValue, value, true);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>And my code for the Save Button is:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>[...]\n\nif(SelectedJob[\"PrevisionType\"] != null)\n{\n    VisualStateManager.GoToState(cmbPrevisionTypeControl, \"InvalidFocused\", true);\n    return;\n}\n\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance and I'm sorry if I got a  little bit confused on explaining this.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 1: I had already read on those questions here, but they don't quite help me:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788287/idataerrorinfo-not-seeing-any-error-message-even-though-one-gets-picked-up\">IDataErrorInfo - not seeing any error message even though one gets picked up</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5183249/silverlight-idataerrorinfo-message-does-not-show-in-custom-controls-textbox\">Silverlight IDataErrorInfo message does not show in custom control&#39;s textbox</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":1,"question_id":7879460,"title":"How to make HyperlinkButton navigate to an existing instance of a .xaml view?","body":"<p>The following xaml snippets will cause a new instance of admin.xaml to be created every time it is navigated to.

to record accelerometer readings in a persistent storage file on a windows phone","body":"<p>``I am trying to develop a Windows phone application which can record accelerometer readings after every 10 secs or so to a persistent file storage area.</p>\n\n<p>For that, I have written a program code which gets the accelerometer readings and displays them seperately( one textblock for x reading, one for y reading and one for z reading).

THe service agent inturn calls a WCF service which is configured with a custombinding with binary encoding and httptransport. This WCF service is hoested in the same application as Silverlight and the calls from service agent is being made through \"operationame\"Async methods. Theservice agent has custom events that will be fired when \"operation\"Completed method is called. This service agent event will be handled by silverlight. This WCF service again makes a call to a distributed WCF service using \"operationame\"Async method.</p>\n\n<p>My silverlight application has four different widgets in the screen and they make four calls to the service agent. The four calls from the service agent are being triggered parallely to the in process WCF service.

Why is that so?</p>\n\n<p>Update: Looks like XmlSerializer is getting confused as to which reference to load.That's because Silverlight has XmlSerializer defined inside System.Xml.Serialization.dll assembly and .NET framework has it in System.Xml.dll. My project D has reference to System.Xml and C has System.Xml and System.Xml.Serialization. How do I make sure C always references Silverlight version of dlls?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","silverlight","timeout"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":286,"score":1,"question_id":9347852,"title":"Increase Timeout in silverlight application","body":"<p>I have a silverlight 4 application with RIA service enabled, also the silverlight uses a WCF service and the whole things are hosted on IIS.\nI need to increase the timeout of the silverlight for the WCF service and ria services, and IIS 7.5.\nHow can I set the releated timeout settings (ria services, WCF, IIS)?\nP.S</p>\n\n<p>where are the correspoding fields in the configuration?</p>\n"},{"tags":["silverlight","silverlight-4.0","wcf"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2060,"score":1,"question_id":4150493,"title":"Silverlight 4 WCF RIA Service Timeout Problem","body":"<p>I have a Silverlight 4 usercontrol that calls a very long running WCF RIA service.

The problem is: I don't want to repeat it in every view CodeBehind I have, so I decided to make a custom ViewBase where I would leave this code on it. What I did was simply:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ViewBase : ChildWindow\n{\n    protected void tboxTextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        TextBox txCtl = (TextBox)sender; if (txCtl != null)\n        {\n            var be = txCtl.GetBindingExpression(TextBox.TextProperty);\n\n            if (be != null)\n            {\n                be.UpdateSource();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then my view now is a ViewBase, instead of a UserControl, so I also changed the XAML to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;src:ViewBase x:Class=\"Oi.SCPOBU.Silverlight.Pages.CadastroClassificacao\"\nxmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"    \nxmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\nxmlns:src=\"clr-namespace:Oi.SCPOBU.Silverlight.Pages\" [...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, in my textbox I left the event referencing the same method as usual, but now the method is in ViewBase, istead of being in the CodeBehind:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;TextBox\n   x:Name=\"tbxNome\"\n   Width=\"300\"\n   MaxLength=\"50\"\n   HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\"\n   TextChanged=\"tboxTextChanged\"\n   Text=\"{Binding DTOClassificacao.Nome, Mode=TwoWay, NotifyOnValidationError=True&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Seems pretty straightforward to me, but this doesn't work. The code compiles, but in runtime I get the error: \"Message=Failed to assign to property 'System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.TextChanged'. [Line: 43 Position: 37]\", on the InitializeComponent() Method. </p>\n\n<p>Anybody knows how can I assign a method from my base class to an event? Or will I really have to repeat this code in every single View I have?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","algorithm","silverlight","math"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":217,"score":1,"question_id":4106935,"title":"Determine rows/columns needed given a number","body":"<p>I've got a number of controls (charts in this case) that's determined at runtime.
