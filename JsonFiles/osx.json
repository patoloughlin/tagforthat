Further info is available in the <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u-relnotes-515228.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Release Notes</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1854982\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roadmap</a>.  It's not tremendously surprising that such an issue could crop up as support shifts to Java FX.</p>\n\n<p>The question becomes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Will Oracle fix this in a near-term release of the JDK?

The good news: input works!  The bad news: there really don't seem to be any kiosking/isolation options.\n<BR>I tried killing the Dock - <a href=\"http://wtanaka.com/node/8008\" rel=\"nofollow\">directly</a> or with an <a href=\"http://www.mechodownload.com/forum/applications/283595-dock-killer-1-2-a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">App</a> - as I understand the Dock is responsible for Command-Tab app switching, Mission Control, and Launch Pad, only to find out that it's responsible for the handling of fullscreen apps as well!  As such, the Java calls become non-functional and never return.<BR>\nIf there's a way to <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/453241/is-it-possible-to-disable-the-command-tab-application-switcher-in-mac-os-x-lion\">disable Command-Tab</a> (and Mission Control and Launchpad and Spaces) without affecting the Dock's fullscreen handling, that would be extremely useful. Alternatively, one can try to remap certain keys such as Command, but that will affect the ability to use that modifier elsewhere in the program and the system itself (not exactly ideal, when you need to Command-C to copy some text).</p></li>\n<li><p>I've had no luck with KeyListeners (I'm not receiving any callbacks), but I have a few more options to try.</p></li>\n<li><p>Based on a coworker's suggestion, I tried <code>((sun.lwawt.macosx.LWCToolkit)Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()).isApplicationActive()</code> via reflection.  The idea was that it:<BR>\n<em>is a native method with the comment \"Returns true if the application (one of its windows) owns keyboard focus.\". Calls to this method were added in CPlatformWindow.java in the past few months related to focus logic. If it returns false in your test code, it's probably part of the problem.</em><BR>\nUnfortunately, everywhere I checked it, the method returned true.  So even according to the low level system, my windows should have keyboard focus.</p></li>\n<li><p>My previous optimism regarding the JAlbum fix has been dashed.  The developer <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/forum/thread.jspa?messageID=264497\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted a response on their forum</a> that explains how they simply removed proper fullscreen support on OS X while running Java 7.  They have a bug into Oracle (and I'm hoping to get the bug number).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 10/25:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now also tried Java 7u9 on Lion 10.7.4 and have seen the exact same issue, so it's JDK- not OS-specific.</p>\n\n<p>The core question has become whether you can embed in a fullscreen window core Swing Components that have default handling for keyboard input (<code>JTextField/JTextArea</code> or even editable combo boxes) and expect them to behave normally (without having to resort to rebuilding their basic key bindings manually).  Also in question is whether other stalwarts of windowed layouts, such as using tab for focus traversal, should work.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal goal would be to have the ability take a windowed Swing app with all of its buttons, tabs, fields, etc. and run it in fullscreen exclusive/kiosk mode with most functionality intact.  (Previously, I have seen that Dialog pop ups or ComboBox drop downs do not function in fullscreen on Java 6 on OS X, but other Components behave fine.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll be looking into the eawt FullScreen capabilities, which will be interesting if they support kiosk lock down options, such as eliminating Command-Tab application switching.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Swing app that for years has supported <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FullScreen (exclusive)</a> mode on Mac OS X up through Java 6.  I've been doing compatibility testing with the latest Mountain Lion release (10.8.2 Supplemental) and Oracle's JDK 7 and noticed a glaring issue while in that mode: mouse movement and clicks work fine, but keyboard input is not delivered to the components.  </p>\n\n<p>(I've narrowed this down in a test case below to not being able to type into a simple JTextField while in fullscreen mode.)</p>\n\n<p>One symptom is that each key press results in a system beep, as if the OS is disallowing keyboard events from being delivered to the application.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, my application has an exit hook installed, and the Command-Q combo will trigger that hook - it's clear that the OS is listening to standard key combos.</p>\n\n<p>I have tested this separately on three different Macs with various installs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Apple Java 6u35 and 6u37: both windowed and fullscreen modes receive input.</li>\n<li>On Oracle Java 7u7 and 7u9: windowed mode works as expected while fullscreen has the symptoms above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This may have been previously reported:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13015442/java-graphics-full-screen-mode-not-registering-keyboard-input\">Java Graphics Full Screen Mode not Registering Keyboard Input</a>.\nHowever, that question is not specific about the Java version or platform.</p>\n\n<p>Additional searching has turned up a separate fullscreen option introduced in Lion:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6873568/fullscreen-feature-for-java-apps-on-osx-lion\">Fullscreen feature for Java Apps on OSX Lion</a>. \nI have yet to try using this approach, as keyboard input seems integral to the target use cases of FullScreen Exclusive mode, such as games.</p>\n\n<p>There is some mention in the JavaDoc for this mode that input methods might be disabled.  I tried to call the suggested <code>Component.enableInputMethods(false)</code>, but it seemed to <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/GraphicsDevice.html#setFullScreenWindow%28java.awt.Window%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">have no effect</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm somewhat optimistic that there's a solution to this issue based on an entry in the release notes of a Java app I came across (JAlbum). A <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/en/software/release-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated fix for 10.10.6</a>: \"Keyboard support wasn't working when running the full screen slide show on Mac and Java 7\"</p>\n\n<p>My test case is below.  It is lightly modified from the second example in this issue (which, unmodified, also exhibits my problem): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7456227/how-to-handle-events-from-keyboard-and-mouse-in-full-screen-exclusive-mode-in-ja/7457102#7457102\">How to handle events from keyboard and mouse in full screen exclusive mode in java?</a>\nIn particular, it adds a button to toggle fullscreen.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport java.beans.*;\n\n/** @see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064607/ */\npublic class FullScreenTest extends JPanel {\n    private GraphicsDevice dev = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getDefaultScreenDevice();\n    private JFrame f = new JFrame(\"FullScreenTest\");\n\n    private static final String EXIT = \"Exit\";\n    private Action exit = new AbstractAction(EXIT) {\n        @Override\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n            Object o = dev.getFullScreenWindow();\n            if(o != null) {\n                dev.setFullScreenWindow(null);\n            }\n            f.dispatchEvent(new WindowEvent(f, WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING));\n        }\n    };\n    private JButton exitBTN = new JButton(exit);\n\n    private JTextField jtf = new JTextField(\"Uneditable in FullScreen with Java7u6+ on Mac OS X 10.7.3+\");\n\n    private JLabel keystrokeLabel = new JLabel(\"(Last Modifier+Key Pressed in JTextField)\");\n\n    private JLabel jtfFocusLabel = new JLabel(\"(JTextField Focus State)\");\n\n    private JLabel focusLabel = new JLabel(\"(Focused Component Hierarchy)\");\n\n    private JCheckBox useOSXFullScreenCB = new JCheckBox(\"Use Lion-Style FullScreen Mode\");\n\n    private JCheckBox useWorkaroundCB = new JCheckBox(\"Use Visibility Workaround to Restore 1st Responder Window\");\n\n    private static final String TOGGLE = \"Toggle FullScreen (Command-T or Enter)\"; \n    private Action toggle = new AbstractAction(TOGGLE) {\n        @Override\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n            Object o = dev.getFullScreenWindow();\n            if(o == null) {\n                f.pack();\n\n                /** \n                 * !!

I don't quite understand what caused a problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>\nforgot to mention, the original repository is cloned from \"git://...\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT3</strong> \napparently, the problem was that i used a USB flash drive to carry things from one os to another, and did not thought that it could make my life harder :) coppied everything again from scratch without USB and the problem is gone.</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","in-app-purchase","fullscreen"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":1,"question_id":13251550,"title":"How to make OSX In-app purchase alerts visible in front of full screen window?","body":"<p>After making the main window full screen and change the window level:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [fullScreenWindow setLevel:NSMainMenuWindowLevel+1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>all the In-app purchase alerts are displayed behind, and not visible for user, unless you switch to background or change the window level again to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [fullScreenWindow setLevel:NSNormalWindowLevel];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How to make In-app purchase alerts visible in front of full screen window? or if not possible, how to detect that alert is displayed at the moment?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","osx","sockets","signals"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":1,"question_id":13251315,"title":"Avoiding SIGPIPE in mac osx - reg","body":"<p>In order to avoid SIGPIPE in mac osx \ni tried using the flag</p>\n\n<pre><code> SO_NOSIGPIPE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is equivalent of  </p>\n\n<pre><code> MSG_NOSIGNAL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in linux.

Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in.

As it's quite heavy on STL, I'd really like to use a GDB version with python support (i.e. >=v7) for pretty printing of containers. My application is split up into a backend library (.dylib) that does all the heavy lifting, and a very simple frontend application. All of the sources and binaries are below a common source path, and everything has been compiled with debugging symbols (I tried both -g and -ggdb).</p>\n\n<p>Using the GDB version in XCode (which identifies as \"GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1820)\"), displaying the source lines of frames in a backtrace works as expected out of the box, no matter whether the respective call happens in the frontend app or the backend library:</p>\n\n<p>(gdb) f 12</p>\n\n<p>#12 0x000000010002ddc5 in FL3D::Resource::createMesh_ (this=0x7fff5fbff7c8, fl3d=@0x7fff5fbff1f8, id=) at /Development/workspace/fl3d/libfl3d/resource.cpp:234</p>\n\n<p>234             std::vector&amp; t = textureIndices_.at(i);</p>\n\n<p>(gdb)</p>\n\n<p>So far so good.

I know you can switch off ARC but we want to make sure that we will still be able to commit updates to our old projects and we can't afford to put lots of time and effort in the conversion process.</p>\n\n<p>I spent some time reading the user comments below the xCode update on the AppStore and read that the new Version deleted old projects. Of course we have a backup but this makes me uncertain if it's the right step.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have experience how this works in a non personal environment? At home I'm running Mountain Lion and xCode converted small projects by itself. I'm just not sure about large scale projects...</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit: I will upgrade one system tomorrow and then try to post the results and maybe some tipps, important steps and things to be aware of.</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","osx","svn"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":1,"question_id":13142053,"title":"How to connect to SVN from one Mac to another in same network?","body":"<p>I've set up a SVN repository on a Mac machine, let's say Mac1.

Here's the problem: I'm inserting a \"_loadingLayer\" (a CATextLayer that says the video is loading), and then observing the AVPlayer's currentItem's status property to figure out when to remove the \"_loadingLayer\" and replace it with my actual \"_playerLayer\". Here's my KVO code for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {\n\nif ((object == _playerLayer) &amp;&amp; (_playerLayer.player.currentItem.status == AVPlayerItemStatusReadyToPlay)) {\n\n    [CATransaction setAnimationDuration:1.8];\n\n    _loadingLayer.opaque = NO;\n\n    if (_playerLayer.readyForDisplay) {\n\n        NSLog(@\"Should be ready now.\");\n\n    }\n\n    [self addPlayerLayerToLayerTree];\n\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that the video is starting, but only the audio is playing -- the layer stays black.

I was originally using Ida, which is a Danish voice. I have now tested it with many different voices and I can confirm that it works well with all English voices. However it fell out of sync with Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Dutch. It probably affects other languages as well, but these are the ones I have tested so far.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","osx","cpu-architecture","release-mode"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13095053,"title":"What are possible causes of Xcode not actually running an executable even though it says \"finished running...\"?","body":"<p>I have a project building for and running on OS X 10.7, and when running, it clear doesn't actually run the program, i.e. no output, no breakpoints in main() hit etc. It immediately returns with \"finished running ...\".

After the new event has been passed back to the event system, the new event will be released along with the original event.</p>\n  \n  <p>NULL if the event passed in is to be deleted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm returning NULL, but the event doesn't seem to be deleted.

This problem has had me stressed out for quite some time now and there doesn't seem to be any clear solution, other than forcing non-windows machines to use the file permissions windows seems to inflict.</p>\n\n<p>Let's begin with the scenario. I have 2 development machines, one running Windows7, the other Mac OSX. They both are using Eclipse and EGit, and both have cloned the same project from a remote repo. That's where the similarities end, because my windows machine has a nasty habit of retaining a file mode of <strong>644</strong> (r-xr--r--) on its local repo, while the mode on the Mac defaults to a cool <strong>775</strong> (rwxrwxr--x).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem's obviously the file permissions - GIT reports there are files that have changed due to differences in file modes and not actual content. The solution seemed obvious, run the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code> git config core.filemode false\n git config --global core.filemode false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which worked like a charm, <em>except</em> when committing and merging resolved <em>conflicts</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say files A, B and C exist on both the Windows and Mac repos. Next, let's change the file mode for these 3 files on the Mac machine so that the developer can edit them. Now change some of the contents in file A. Because we're ignoring the file modes (thanks to the commands above) only file A will be committed and pushed, ready for the Windows machine to fetch, merge and enjoy...</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's edit file A again on the Mac <em>and</em> on the Windows machines, effectively causing a potential conflict, and let the Windows machine commit and push file A first. Then, when the Mac user commits their changes to file A and fetches the latest changes from the remote repo, a conflict is obviously created.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving the conflict on the Mac machine and adding file A back to their local repo, committing that merge includes the previously ignored files B and C, and thus highlighting my problem! Why are the previously ignored files being included in this merge commit? This doesn't seem to be a Mac / Windows problem exclusively, as this problem can be recreated both ways...</p>\n\n<p>This probably wouldn't matter if there were only 3 files, but this project I'm referring to includes thousands, and all these up and down push and pulls are insane.

I am doing my own reading an interleaving and not using AVAssetReader. My reader ensures that exactly one frame's worth of video data and one frame's worth of audio data are presented in a serial fashion. The problem I am having is if I don't set the expectsMediaDataInRealTime property to <strong>YES</strong>, the video asset writer will always return <strong>NO</strong> for isReadyForMoreMediaData after exactly 30 frames. If I stop writing before 30 frames, it works fine and the output file is valid. However, if I set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to YES, it works perfectly for the entire duration, which can be several thousand frames. After starting a transcode operation with expectsMediaDataInRealTime set to YES, I watched the app's memory usage over the course of compressing a very long video and there wasn't any unreasonable memory usage nor any memory leaks. And the resulting MOV file did appear to be written fairly normal, e.g. the audio data was interleaved with the video data as one would expect.</p>\n\n<p>So, why would I ever set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to NO if there is no apparent downside to setting it to YES? Does this only apply when using an Apple API to read data (using AVAssetReader)?
