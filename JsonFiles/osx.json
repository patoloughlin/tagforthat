My first thought was to double the height of the row under the mouse during a drag by sending <code>-noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code> in my data source's <code>-tableView:validateDrop:...</code> method, then returning twice the normal height in <code>-tableView:heightOfRow:</code>. Unfortunately, best I can tell, NSTableView doesn't update its layout during drag and drop, so despite calling <code>noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code>, the row height isn't actually updated.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I'm using a view-based NSTableView, but my rows are not so complex that I couldn't move to a cell-based table view if doing so helped accomplish this. I'm aware of the easy, built-in ability to animate a gap for the dropped item after a drag is complete. I'm looking for a way to open a gap while the drag is in progress. Also, this is for an app to be sold in the Mac App Store, so it must not use private API.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've just filed an enhancement request with Apple requesting built in support for this behavior: <a href=\"http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624</a>.

Only each framework's directory structure is copied in and not the actual shared library binary.  For example, my bundle uses SFML 2.0's System framework.  Note that all SFML frameworks I use are stored in <code>/Library/Frameworks</code>.  Here is what I get in <code>MyApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/</code> with respect to this SFML component:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sfml-system.framework/\n    Versions/\n        2.0.0/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's all I get, just the directories.  The actual SFML System framework has a structure like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sfml-system.framework/\n    Resources  (this is a symlink)\n    sfml-system  (this is a symlink)\n    Versions/\n        2.0.0/\n            Resources/\n                Info.plist\n            sfml-system  (this is the actual library binary)\n        Current  (this is a symlink)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my project, executables all have the same format so I have a small function to add them using this common format.  The function just adds the executable, sets the libraries to link against, and at install time, installs the application bundle and calls FIXUP_BUNDLE on it.  Here is that function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FUNCTION(ADD_CUSTOM_EXECUTABLE TARGET HEADERS SOURCES DEPENDENCIES)\n    ADD_EXECUTABLE(${TARGET} MACOSX_BUNDLE ${HEADERS} ${SOURCES} ${ARGN})\n    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${TARGET} ${DEPENDENCIES})\n\n    INSTALL(TARGETS ${TARGET} BUNDLE DESTINATION .)\n\n    INSTALL(CODE \"\n        INCLUDE(BundleUtilities)\n        FIXUP_BUNDLE(${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${TARGET}.app \\\"\\\" \\\"\\\") \n    \")\nENDFUNCTION(ADD_CUSTOM_EXECUTABLE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't pass in anything for the LIBS or DIRS parameters of FIXUP_BUNDLE because I am currently not using any plugins.  The ALL_BUILD project builds fine in Xcode, and the install project runs without failing, but produces many warnings like this for each library discovered via <code>otool -L</code>.  Here's an example showing the start of the warnings for SFML's System framework, almost immediately after FIXUP_BUNDLE is called:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fixup_bundle\n    app='/Users/user/Desktop/SFML_Testing_BUILD/dist/MyApp.app'\n    libs=''\n    dirs=''\nfixup_bundle: preparing...\nwarning: embedded item does not exist 'Users/user/Desktop/SFML_Testing_BUILD/\ndist/MyApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/sfml-system.framework/Versions/2.0.0/\nsfml-system'\nwarning: cannot resolve item '@executable_path/../Frameworks/\nsfml-system.framework/Versions/2.0.0/sfml-system'\n\npossible problems:\n    need more directories?\n    need to use InstallRequiredSystemLibraries?\n    run in install tree instead of build tree?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And a short bit later, stuff like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>warning: target '@executable_path/../Frameworks/sfml-system.framework/Versions/\n2.0.0/sfml-system' is not absolute...\nwarning: target '@executable_path/../Frameworks/sfml-system.framework/Versions/\n2.0.0/sfml-system' does not exist...\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/\nusr/bin/otool: can't open file: @executable_path/../Frameworks/\nsfml-system.framework/Versions/2.0.0/sfml-system (No such file or directory)\notool: can't open file: @executable_path/../Frameworks/\nsfml-system.framework/Versions/2.0.0/sfml-system\n(No such file or directory)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to resolve this issue?

The good news: input works!  The bad news: there really don't seem to be any kiosking/isolation options.\n<BR>I tried killing the Dock - <a href=\"http://wtanaka.com/node/8008\" rel=\"nofollow\">directly</a> or with an <a href=\"http://www.mechodownload.com/forum/applications/283595-dock-killer-1-2-a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">App</a> - as I understand the Dock is responsible for Command-Tab app switching, Mission Control, and Launch Pad, only to find out that it's responsible for the handling of fullscreen apps as well!  As such, the Java calls become non-functional and never return.<BR>\nIf there's a way to <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/453241/is-it-possible-to-disable-the-command-tab-application-switcher-in-mac-os-x-lion\">disable Command-Tab</a> (and Mission Control and Launchpad and Spaces) without affecting the Dock's fullscreen handling, that would be extremely useful. Alternatively, one can try to remap certain keys such as Command, but that will affect the ability to use that modifier elsewhere in the program and the system itself (not exactly ideal, when you need to Command-C to copy some text).</p></li>\n<li><p>I've had no luck with KeyListeners (I'm not receiving any callbacks), but I have a few more options to try.</p></li>\n<li><p>Based on a coworker's suggestion, I tried <code>((sun.lwawt.macosx.LWCToolkit)Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()).isApplicationActive()</code> via reflection.  The idea was that it:<BR>\n<em>is a native method with the comment \"Returns true if the application (one of its windows) owns keyboard focus.\". Calls to this method were added in CPlatformWindow.java in the past few months related to focus logic. If it returns false in your test code, it's probably part of the problem.</em><BR>\nUnfortunately, everywhere I checked it, the method returned true.  So even according to the low level system, my windows should have keyboard focus.</p></li>\n<li><p>My previous optimism regarding the JAlbum fix has been dashed.  The developer <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/forum/thread.jspa?messageID=264497\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted a response on their forum</a> that explains how they simply removed proper fullscreen support on OS X while running Java 7.  They have a bug into Oracle (and I'm hoping to get the bug number).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 10/25:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now also tried Java 7u9 on Lion 10.7.4 and have seen the exact same issue, so it's JDK- not OS-specific.</p>\n\n<p>The core question has become whether you can embed in a fullscreen window core Swing Components that have default handling for keyboard input (<code>JTextField/JTextArea</code> or even editable combo boxes) and expect them to behave normally (without having to resort to rebuilding their basic key bindings manually).  Also in question is whether other stalwarts of windowed layouts, such as using tab for focus traversal, should work.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal goal would be to have the ability take a windowed Swing app with all of its buttons, tabs, fields, etc. and run it in fullscreen exclusive/kiosk mode with most functionality intact.  (Previously, I have seen that Dialog pop ups or ComboBox drop downs do not function in fullscreen on Java 6 on OS X, but other Components behave fine.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll be looking into the eawt FullScreen capabilities, which will be interesting if they support kiosk lock down options, such as eliminating Command-Tab application switching.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Swing app that for years has supported <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FullScreen (exclusive)</a> mode on Mac OS X up through Java 6.  I've been doing compatibility testing with the latest Mountain Lion release (10.8.2 Supplemental) and Oracle's JDK 7 and noticed a glaring issue while in that mode: mouse movement and clicks work fine, but keyboard input is not delivered to the components.  </p>\n\n<p>(I've narrowed this down in a test case below to not being able to type into a simple JTextField while in fullscreen mode.)</p>\n\n<p>One symptom is that each key press results in a system beep, as if the OS is disallowing keyboard events from being delivered to the application.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, my application has an exit hook installed, and the Command-Q combo will trigger that hook - it's clear that the OS is listening to standard key combos.</p>\n\n<p>I have tested this separately on three different Macs with various installs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Apple Java 6u35 and 6u37: both windowed and fullscreen modes receive input.</li>\n<li>On Oracle Java 7u7 and 7u9: windowed mode works as expected while fullscreen has the symptoms above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This may have been previously reported:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13015442/java-graphics-full-screen-mode-not-registering-keyboard-input\">Java Graphics Full Screen Mode not Registering Keyboard Input</a>.\nHowever, that question is not specific about the Java version or platform.</p>\n\n<p>Additional searching has turned up a separate fullscreen option introduced in Lion:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6873568/fullscreen-feature-for-java-apps-on-osx-lion\">Fullscreen feature for Java Apps on OSX Lion</a>. \nI have yet to try using this approach, as keyboard input seems integral to the target use cases of FullScreen Exclusive mode, such as games.</p>\n\n<p>There is some mention in the JavaDoc for this mode that input methods might be disabled.  I tried to call the suggested <code>Component.enableInputMethods(false)</code>, but it seemed to <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/GraphicsDevice.html#setFullScreenWindow%28java.awt.Window%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">have no effect</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm somewhat optimistic that there's a solution to this issue based on an entry in the release notes of a Java app I came across (JAlbum). A <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/en/software/release-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated fix for 10.10.6</a>: \"Keyboard support wasn't working when running the full screen slide show on Mac and Java 7\"</p>\n\n<p>My test case is below.

I don't quite understand what caused a problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>\nforgot to mention, the original repository is cloned from \"git://...\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT3</strong> \napparently, the problem was that i used a USB flash drive to carry things from one os to another, and did not thought that it could make my life harder :) coppied everything again from scratch without USB and the problem is gone.</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","in-app-purchase","fullscreen"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":1,"question_id":13251550,"title":"How to make OSX In-app purchase alerts visible in front of full screen window?","body":"<p>After making the main window full screen and change the window level:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [fullScreenWindow setLevel:NSMainMenuWindowLevel+1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>all the In-app purchase alerts are displayed behind, and not visible for user, unless you switch to background or change the window level again to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [fullScreenWindow setLevel:NSNormalWindowLevel];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How to make In-app purchase alerts visible in front of full screen window? or if not possible, how to detect that alert is displayed at the moment?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","osx","sockets","signals"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":1,"question_id":13251315,"title":"Avoiding SIGPIPE in mac osx - reg","body":"<p>In order to avoid SIGPIPE in mac osx \ni tried using the flag</p>\n\n<pre><code> SO_NOSIGPIPE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is equivalent of  </p>\n\n<pre><code> MSG_NOSIGNAL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in linux.

Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","apache2","osx-mountain-lion","mac-os-x-server"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":249,"score":0,"question_id":12064639,"title":"Can't get Phusion Passenger working with Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Apache","body":"<p>I just purchased a new Mac mini with Lion Server installed, and immediately upgraded to Mountain Lion Server.

All of the sources and binaries are below a common source path, and everything has been compiled with debugging symbols (I tried both -g and -ggdb).</p>\n\n<p>Using the GDB version in XCode (which identifies as \"GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1820)\"), displaying the source lines of frames in a backtrace works as expected out of the box, no matter whether the respective call happens in the frontend app or the backend library:</p>\n\n<p>(gdb) f 12</p>\n\n<p>#12 0x000000010002ddc5 in FL3D::Resource::createMesh_ (this=0x7fff5fbff7c8, fl3d=@0x7fff5fbff1f8, id=) at /Development/workspace/fl3d/libfl3d/resource.cpp:234</p>\n\n<p>234             std::vector&amp; t = textureIndices_.at(i);</p>\n\n<p>(gdb)</p>\n\n<p>So far so good. GDB 7.5 and 7.4.1, on the other hand, refuse to give me any source lines from the library:</p>\n\n<p>(gdb) f 12</p>\n\n<p>#12 0x000000010002ddc5 in FL3D::Resource::createMesh_(FL3D::FL3DParser&amp;, std::string) ()\n   from /Development/workspace/fl3d/libfl3d/build/libfl3d.dylib</p>\n\n<p>(gdb) </p>\n\n<p>I'm really confused by the different responses given – gdb6 prints the correct path to the source file and the correct line, while gdb7 gets the function prototype right (supposedly read from the debugging symbols of the .dylib?), but doesn't seem to know anything about the source. Interestingly, though, it DOES show the corresponding source line for calls in the frontend's main() function!</p>\n\n<p>I've already tried manually setting the path to the library's source files with \"dir libfl3d\", but that doesn't change anything. I also notice that gdb6 says \"Reading symbols for shared libraries\" a few times when I run the application and gdb7 doesn't – but the symbols don't seem to be the problem, as they seem to be resolved correctly by both versions?</p>\n\n<p>I'm at my wit's end here. Any pointers?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","osx","osx-mountain-lion","osx-leopard"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":118,"score":0,"question_id":13117032,"title":"Cloning repositories using mercurial eclipse not working on macos 10.8.2","body":"<p>I am updated my mac os 10.7.4 to 10.8.2(osx-mountain-lion) .

Here's the problem: I'm inserting a \"_loadingLayer\" (a CATextLayer that says the video is loading), and then observing the AVPlayer's currentItem's status property to figure out when to remove the \"_loadingLayer\" and replace it with my actual \"_playerLayer\". Here's my KVO code for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {\n\nif ((object == _playerLayer) &amp;&amp; (_playerLayer.player.currentItem.status == AVPlayerItemStatusReadyToPlay)) {\n\n    [CATransaction setAnimationDuration:1.8];\n\n    _loadingLayer.opaque = NO;\n\n    if (_playerLayer.readyForDisplay) {\n\n        NSLog(@\"Should be ready now.\");\n\n    }\n\n    [self addPlayerLayerToLayerTree];\n\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that the video is starting, but only the audio is playing -- the layer stays black.

I was originally using Ida, which is a Danish voice. I have now tested it with many different voices and I can confirm that it works well with all English voices. However it fell out of sync with Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Dutch. It probably affects other languages as well, but these are the ones I have tested so far.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","osx","cpu-architecture","release-mode"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13095053,"title":"What are possible causes of Xcode not actually running an executable even though it says \"finished running...\"?","body":"<p>I have a project building for and running on OS X 10.7, and when running, it clear doesn't actually run the program, i.e. no output, no breakpoints in main() hit etc. It immediately returns with \"finished running ...\".

After the new event has been passed back to the event system, the new event will be released along with the original event.</p>\n  \n  <p>NULL if the event passed in is to be deleted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm returning NULL, but the event doesn't seem to be deleted.

This problem has had me stressed out for quite some time now and there doesn't seem to be any clear solution, other than forcing non-windows machines to use the file permissions windows seems to inflict.</p>\n\n<p>Let's begin with the scenario. I have 2 development machines, one running Windows7, the other Mac OSX. They both are using Eclipse and EGit, and both have cloned the same project from a remote repo. That's where the similarities end, because my windows machine has a nasty habit of retaining a file mode of <strong>644</strong> (r-xr--r--) on its local repo, while the mode on the Mac defaults to a cool <strong>775</strong> (rwxrwxr--x).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem's obviously the file permissions - GIT reports there are files that have changed due to differences in file modes and not actual content. The solution seemed obvious, run the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code> git config core.filemode false\n git config --global core.filemode false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which worked like a charm, <em>except</em> when committing and merging resolved <em>conflicts</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say files A, B and C exist on both the Windows and Mac repos. Next, let's change the file mode for these 3 files on the Mac machine so that the developer can edit them. Now change some of the contents in file A. Because we're ignoring the file modes (thanks to the commands above) only file A will be committed and pushed, ready for the Windows machine to fetch, merge and enjoy...</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's edit file A again on the Mac <em>and</em> on the Windows machines, effectively causing a potential conflict, and let the Windows machine commit and push file A first. Then, when the Mac user commits their changes to file A and fetches the latest changes from the remote repo, a conflict is obviously created.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving the conflict on the Mac machine and adding file A back to their local repo, committing that merge includes the previously ignored files B and C, and thus highlighting my problem! Why are the previously ignored files being included in this merge commit? This doesn't seem to be a Mac / Windows problem exclusively, as this problem can be recreated both ways...</p>\n\n<p>This probably wouldn't matter if there were only 3 files, but this project I'm referring to includes thousands, and all these up and down push and pulls are insane.

I am doing my own reading an interleaving and not using AVAssetReader. My reader ensures that exactly one frame's worth of video data and one frame's worth of audio data are presented in a serial fashion. The problem I am having is if I don't set the expectsMediaDataInRealTime property to <strong>YES</strong>, the video asset writer will always return <strong>NO</strong> for isReadyForMoreMediaData after exactly 30 frames. If I stop writing before 30 frames, it works fine and the output file is valid. However, if I set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to YES, it works perfectly for the entire duration, which can be several thousand frames. After starting a transcode operation with expectsMediaDataInRealTime set to YES, I watched the app's memory usage over the course of compressing a very long video and there wasn't any unreasonable memory usage nor any memory leaks. And the resulting MOV file did appear to be written fairly normal, e.g. the audio data was interleaved with the video data as one would expect.</p>\n\n<p>So, why would I ever set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to NO if there is no apparent downside to setting it to YES? Does this only apply when using an Apple API to read data (using AVAssetReader)?

And while my functions put their parameters on the stack, at some point parameter <code>x</code> happens to be put on that magic address and thus cannot be written (subsequent parameters seem to be written correctly). In my case <code>x</code> is a buffer length parameter, which naturally leads to a buffer-overflow and crash.</p>\n\n<p>Does somebody have a deeper understanding of the stack-protector?

The application targets 10.5+. I'm using Uli Kusterer's <a href=\"https://github.com/uliwitness/oldiconutil\" rel=\"nofollow\">oldiconutil</a> to post process the .icns file I make from a .iconset using iconutil on 10.8. The problem is that if I include a 1024x1024 icon (\"icon_512x512@2x.png\"), the icon does not display on 10.5. Finder doesn't display the icon, and when it is opened in Icon Composer on 10.5, it appears to be blank/empty. If I remove this largest size, the icon displays correctly on 10.5. Interestingly, if I substitute a completely different, simpler 1024x1024 image with a much smaller file size (~300K instead of ~1MB), the icon again works fine on 10.5. So it seems that there may be some limit on the file size of the overall .icns file and/or the individual image chunks in a .icns file that when exceeded breaks compatibility with Leopard.</p>\n\n<p>Compressing the 1024x1024 image with <a href=\"http://tinypng.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">TinyPNG</a> was not enough to fix the problem.

Can anybody tell me what can I do to successfully create project  from zend studio or zend tool?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any step by step guide available for mac os x lion ?\nany help will be much appreciated!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1 -</strong> OMG! how can I skip this... when I am creating project form zend studio its not putting zend library in \"library\" folder... thats why I am getting blank page... I just copied the zend folder in library and project form zend studio got working... </p>\n\n<p>still working to resolve the first issue (setting zf.sh) :( </p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","assembly","x86-64"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":12832553,"title":"Mmap returns 0 on MacOS X 10.8.2 in assembler","body":"<p>I'm just doing some assembly for fun on MacOS X and at the moment am just trying to map a file into memory using the mmap system call, however i'm a bit puzzled at the moment.

For instance, when I have an 360 xbox driver kext in house, xbox controller from microsoft will work, but not the Logitech one (I tried F710). </p>\n\n<p>As Apple suggests the application that uses gamepad or joystick should be able to do themselves at user space without introducing any kext stuff. I was wondering if anyone has any luck on that path. </p>\n\n<p>The thing I had in mind is something like using IORegistry or IOUSB API to get the device when they get plugged in (USB Prober shows it at least). Then somehow get the description of the device, then use that description to register the device as a HID one. Then the whole HID manager can be used. </p>\n\n<p>Am I on the right track? Or is there any other way to do this? </p>\n\n<p>Since IOKit API actually provided keywords like kHIDUsage_GD_Joystick, and there's an ForceFeedback.h library, I suppose Apple designed their HID API with joystick and force feedback in mind.

Ihave browsed the web for hours without finding any solution. Here is the problem :</p>\n\n<p>For those who know this software, I am using Webots (a robot simulation software) and I would like to implement a physic plugin. I copied the code from an already existing (and working) plugin, just to try it out. I am compiling with webots, which uses a gcc (I had to install a gcc compiler since it doesn't come with Xcode anymore). </p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is that the .c file includes a \"physics.h\" header which includes the OpenGL/gl.h file and I then get the error : \"OpenGL/gl.h . no such file or directoy\".</p>\n\n<p>Now I've tried to many things :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>making a search for gl.h : it seems it doean't exist (I can't find it, either manually or with the finder search function)</p></li>\n<li><p>replacing the include OpenGL/gl.h by GLUT/glut.h : I get the error \"gl.h and glu.h no such fil or directory\" since their included in the glut.h</p></li>\n<li><p>linking the gl libraries in the makefile and the frameworks as well</p></li>\n<li><p>Probably all the combination of these, using absolute or relative path !</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since OpenGL and GLUT are supposed to be natively installed with OS (I am on using Lion 10.7.5) I guess every needed file should be there. And for this reaon I cannot find a way to download this supposedely missing file... </p>\n\n<p>Moreover a coworker of mine tried and successfully compiled it on linux !

There was the possibility that this shared function could be called from something already running on that queue, so I needed to check for this case in order to prevent a deadlock from a synchronous dispatch to the same queue.</p>\n\n<p>I used code like the following to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void runSynchronouslyOnVideoProcessingQueue(void (^block)(void))\n{\n    dispatch_queue_t videoProcessingQueue = [GPUImageOpenGLESContext sharedOpenGLESQueue];\n\n    if (dispatch_get_current_queue() == videoProcessingQueue)\n    {\n        block();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        dispatch_sync(videoProcessingQueue, block);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This function relies on the use of <code>dispatch_get_current_queue()</code> to determine the identity of the queue this function is running on and compares that against the target queue.

The code must not assume that synchronous execution onto a\n  queue is safe from deadlock if that queue is not the one returned by\n  dispatch_get_current_queue().</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, in iOS 6.0 (but not yet for Mountain Lion), the GCD headers now mark this function as being deprecated.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like I should not be using this function in this manner, but I'm not sure what I should use in its place.

Say, for example, a user drags the <code>~/Documents</code> folder onto your app’s Dock tile (or onto your app’s Finder icon, or into an open window of your app), thereby indicating they want to use that folder. In response, the system makes the <code>~/Documents</code> folder, its contents, and its subfolders available to your app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not clear to me what's meant by the “contents” here. Is this limited to seeing what files are in the folder without being able to read what's in those files? Or does this simply mean that the app will be able to read any file that's (recursively) inside the Documents folder (so it can, for example, read both <code>~/Documents/Foo.txt</code> and <code>~/Documents/Bar/Baz.txt</code>)? And what about write operations (writing to an existing file, deleting one or creating a new file or folder)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","osx","api","java-3d"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":12770878,"title":"How to install the Java3D API in Eclipse","body":"<p>Sorry if this has been asked before, but I couldn't find any tutorials for installing APIs in Eclipse</p>\n\n<p>I'm using a Mac, and I have Eclipse 4.2.1.

I've googled myself silly, and haven't been able to find an answer...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Sample code below</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks @NSGod for pointing me in the right direction -- I ended up adding a <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html%23//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSEvent/addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask%3ahandler%3a\" rel=\"nofollow\">global events monitor</a> using the method addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:handler:, which works beautifully. For completeness, my implementation looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// register for keys throughout the device...\n[NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSKeyDownMask\n                                       handler:^(NSEvent *event){\n\n    NSString *chars = [[event characters] lowercaseString];\n    unichar character = [chars characterAtIndex:0];\n\n    NSLog(@\"keydown globally! Which key? This key: %c\", character);\n\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For me, the tricky part was using blocks, so I'll give a little description in case it helps anyone:</p>\n\n<p>The thing to notice about the above code is that it's all <strong>one single method call</strong> on NSEvent. The block is supplied as an argument, directly <strong>to</strong> the function. You could think of it kind of like an inline delegate method. Just because this took a while to sink in for me, I'm going to work through it step by step here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSKeyDownMask\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This first bit is no problem. You're callling a class method on NSEvent, and telling it which event you're looking to monitor, in this case NSKeyDownMask. A <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html%23//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSEvent/addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask%3ahandler%3a\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of masks for supported event types</a> can be found <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html%23//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSEvent/addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask%3ahandler%3a\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we come to the tricky part: handler, which expects a block:</p>\n\n<pre><code>handler:^(NSEvent *event){\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It took me a few compile errors to get this right, but (thank you Apple) they were very constructive error messages. The first thing to notice is the carat ^. That signals the start of the block. After that, within the parentheses, </p>\n\n<pre><code>NSEvent *event\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which declares the variable that you'll be using within the block to capture the event. You could call it </p>\n\n<pre><code>NSEvent *someCustomNameForAnEvent\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>doesn't matter, you'll just be using that name within the block. Then, that's just about all there is to it. Make sure to close your curly brace, and bracket to finish the method call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you're done! This really is kind of a 'one-liner'. It doesn't matter where you execute this call within your app -- I do it in the AppDelegate's applicationDidFinishLaunching method. Then, within the block, you can call other methods from within your app.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps someone! It really is very simple once you get the block syntax down.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","cocoa","performance","osx","bezier"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":541,"score":1,"question_id":4433522,"title":"Bezier path stroking performance issues","body":"<p>My code goes as following -</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[NSColor whiteColor] set];\n// `path' is a bezier path with more than 1000 points in it\n[path setLineWidth:2];\n[path setLineJoinStyle:NSRoundLineJoinStyle];\n[path stroke];\n// some other stuff...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running the time profiling tool in Instruments it tells me my app is spending 93.5% of the time doing the last line <code>[path stroke]</code>, and Quartz Debugger tells me my app is only running at less than 10 fps (another view changing position on top of it is always causing the update).</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for ways to improve the performance of stroking the bezier path, sometimes paths with more than 1000 points draws very quickly with >60fps, however in some extreme cases even with the same number of points, perhaps if the points are too far from each other (or too dense?) the performance becomes really sluggish.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what I can do about this.

Essentially it also failed, and among other reasons it gave me warnings like the above.</p>\n\n<p>Another section of the output says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>make: *** No rule to make target `/System/Library/Perl/5.10.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/config.h', needed by `Makefile'.  Stop.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I look this up online, and though I understand why it says what it does, I see no way that I could fix this, since these are Makefiles gotten from cpan or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Another section:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Running install for module 'version'\nRunning make for J/JP/JPEACOCK/version-0.9901.tar.gz\nHas already been unwrapped into directory /Users/danielgierl/.cpan/build/version-0.9901-U8IMPt\nCould not make: Unknown error\nWarning (usually harmless): 'YAML' not installed, will not store persistent state\nRunning make test\nCan't test without successful make\nRunning make install\nMake had returned bad status, install seems impossible\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general lots of unknown errors. I am also trouble by the section where it tells me:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Testing if you have a C compiler\nld: library not found for -lbundle1.o\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nlipo: can't open input file: /var/folders/1C/1CnzBuv+F5y+8M5YPm6I4k+++TI/-Tmp-//ccTWRqov.out (No such file or directory)\nerror building /var/folders/1C/1CnzBuv+F5y+8M5YPm6I4k+++TI/-Tmp-/compilet.bundle from /var/folders/1C/1CnzBuv+F5y+8M5YPm6I4k+++TI/-Tmp-/compilet.o at /System/Library/Perl/5.10.0/ExtUtils/CBuilder/Base.pm line 213.\n\nI cannot determine if you have a C compiler\nso I will install a perl-only implementation\n\nYou can force installation of the XS version with\n\nperl Makefile.PL --xs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know for a fact that I have a c compiler, since gcc -v tells me that it is version 4.2.1. On the plus side, it does tell me that my kit looks good (whatever that is). If I try running the command they recommend me, I get told that there is no such file or directory.</p>\n\n<p>After some more Googling, I keep seeing XCode re-re-referenced for Mac users. I already had a version of XCode, but because it might have problems, I uninstall it, then get version 3.2.6 (my OS is too old for the newer versions). The install fails for unknown reasons, and it tells me to contact the software company. However, before it fails, it does install the UNIX tools, including gcc (which I later got the latest version for), so I don't think that's the problem.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this has consumed some 6 hours of my time today, and I'm stressed and physically ill (though I was this morning before starting this futile venture, but it's been exacerbated), and I have no idea where I am supposed to go next.</p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping that it's all been some stupid error that'll be remedied in 10 seconds by an experienced user, but I fear the worst. In general I've done every bit of advice I've found, from running with --sudo to sacrificing a goat to the sun gods. I'd appreciate any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","cocoa","url","nsurl"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12719303,"title":"How to get the path/directory component from a NSURL?","body":"<p>I retrieved a NSURL from a NSSavePanel.
