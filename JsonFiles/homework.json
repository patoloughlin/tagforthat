We're to create Y86 code by reading X86 code generated from C in gdb.  The purpose of the function is to sum the elements of a linked list.</p>\n\n<p>As the function currently stands, it works!   The correct value is contained in the %eax register when the program terminates.  Unfortunately, it is only correct due to a hack.  I added a <code>halt</code> instruction right at the end of the function, right before the <code>ret</code> instruction.  If I uncomment that, what appears to happen is that when it carries out the <code>ret</code> instruction, the PC is set to 0x0.  In other words, it seems to start over at the beginning, when what it <em>should</em> do is return to the point where it was called.  It enters an infinite loop.</p>\n\n<p>The code follows.

For example, I would always be able to tell the last inserted leaf, but if I were to delete it, how would I know which leaf to delete when I next remove the item? The same goes for inserting - how would I know which leaf to jump to next after the current leaf has both children accounted for?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","swing","paintcomponent"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":336,"score":1,"question_id":6554855,"title":"Using a variable with paintComponent","body":"<p>For a homework assignment, I am trying to paint a box with <code>paintComponent</code> using user inputed variables.

But what about negative weighted cycle?</p>\n\n<p>Qd) If G has a cycle with a unique lightest edge e, then e must be part of every MST.</p>\n\n<p>My answer is true.\nWe have to access all nodes in an MST. In a cycle of length 3, for instance, we can always traverse all nodes in that cycle with 2 steps.

As noted above, these text fields are not user editable. \nIn order to develop a robust multi-threaded GUI application in Java, programmer \nhas to ensure that all GUI parameters (i.e., properties of GUI Swing \ncomponents) are actually updated from only one thread: usually the Event \nDispatcher thread. </p>\n\n<p>In order to get some concrete ideas about it, read <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/threads/threads1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Threads and Swing</a></p>\n\n<p>As a result, threads that you create should not have access to any Swing \ncomponents. Rather maintain a data structure that is exposed to and update by \nthreads according to their cycle of execution. On the other hand, periodically \ninvoke repaint() methods from main thread to invite Swing Event Dispatcher \nthread to eventually visit the content of the data structure and display the \nGUI components accordingly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far I have an empty shell of a GUI that does everything mentioned above \nexcept for the actual changing of the button colors.

Let's say for the sake of argument that the system we are working on has an unsigned integer type size of 32 bits.  Let's further say that we have the number 29 stored in an unsigned integer variable.  In memory the number will have 27 zeros ahead of it.

I did not think of this earlier, but if a number like 8 (1000) is used then mayhem.  There is only one set bit in 8, so the shift is most certainly going to be wrong.

My problem is, I have exactly no idea how to do that. </p>\n\n<p>For those who wants to know how my registration page looks like, here it is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;html&gt;\n\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Registration&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"CSS_LABs.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;body&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;form id=\"Registration\" action=\"\" method=\"get\"&gt;\n\n    Username:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"usrname\" maxlength=\"10\"/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\n    Password:&lt;input type=\"password\" name=\"pswd\" maxlength=\"20\"/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    PersonID:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"PID\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    First Name:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"fname\"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n    Last Name:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"lname\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    DOB:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"dob\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Gender:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"sex\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Title:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"title\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Secret Question:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;select name=\"secret?\"&gt;\n    &lt;/select&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    Answer:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"answer\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By the way, I know certain information on my HTML document may not be worded properly, so do hope you guys don't mind. Also, I would also have to fix up my XML later by putting the answer to the secret question within  later. </p>\n\n<p>Alright, thanks a lot in advance guys.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE!!!</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Here we go, I finally figured out how to create an XML document with Javascript, here's the code:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>    var xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLDOM\");\n    var fso = new ActiveXObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\");\n    var FILENAME = 'G:\\\\CST2309 - Web Programming 1\\\\Copy of Take Home Exam - Copy\\\\PersonXML2.xml';\n\n    function SaveXML(UserData) \n    {   \n        var file = fso.CreateTextFile(FILENAME, true);\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\\n');\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;PersonInfo&gt;\\n');\n\n        for (countr = 0; countr &lt; UserData.length; countr++) {\n            file.Write('    &lt;Person ');\n            file.Write('Usrname=\"' + UserData[countr][0] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Pswd=\"' + UserData[countr][1] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('PersonID=\"' + UserData[countr][2] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('FirstName=\"' + UserData[countr][3] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('LastName=\"' + UserData[countr][4] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Gender=\"' + UserData[countr][5] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('DOB=\"' + UserData[countr][6] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Title=\"' + UserData[countr][7] + '\"');\n            file.WriteLine('&gt;&lt;/Person&gt;\\n');\n        } // end for countr\n\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;/PersonInfo&gt;\\n');\n        file.Close();\n\n    } // end SaveXML function --------------------\n\n    function LoadXML(xmlFile) \n    {\n        xmlDoc.load(xmlFile);\n        return xmlDoc.documentElement;\n    } //end function LoadXML()\n\n    function initialize_array() \n    {\n        var person = new Array();\n        var noFile = true;\n        var xmlObj;\n        if (fso.FileExists(FILENAME)) \n        {\n            xmlObj = LoadXML(FILENAME);\n            noFile = false;\n            } // if\n        else \n        {\n            xmlObj = LoadXML(\"PersonXML.xml\");\n            //alert(\"local\" + xmlObj);\n            } // end if\n\n        var usrCount = 0;\n        while (usrCount &lt; xmlObj.childNodes.length) \n        {\n            var tmpUsrs = new Array(xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Usrname\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Pswd\"),\n                        xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"PersonID\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"FirstName\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"LastName\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Gender\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"DOB\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Title\"));\n            person.push(tmpUsrs);\n            usrCount++;\n             }   //end while\n        if (noFile == false)\n            fso.DeleteFile(FILENAME);\n        SaveXML(person);\n    }   // end function initialize_array()  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this code here is doing is that, it takes my original XML file and loads it up into an array so it can create a new XML file. Basically I got the creating the XML file part down, but still need help with the rest of my stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>My goal is trying to take my form data and push it into my existing array, not overwrite it, add to it, so I can update my existing XML file with the new registration information. This is where I have absolutely no idea how to do.

For this particular assignment, we are to do the classic 'Cards in a Deck' program. We are to make two classes, one called 'Card' and the other 'Deck'. Now I've gotten a large chunk of this done so far but a concept seems to be escaping me.</p>\n\n<p>When we call a default constructor for the Card class, all 52 cards are to be created so that the Deck class may use these objects and... well create a deck! Now I attended a session with our TA and he stressed the fact that the default constructor is to initialize the values while the Deck class takes these objects and loops through them to use a function that assigns real card values to the Card objects. </p>\n\n<p>My question is this: what is the best approach for creating these objects so that Deck may reference them? My idea right now is to create a fixed array called 'initialCard[4][13]'. From there, the Deck class will pick a value - say 'initialCard[0][0]' and assign it to an Ace of Spades solely from the row and column of the two-dimensional array. However, my TA keep saying 'create an array of Card objects'. What could he mean by that? I have a slight grasp but I'm just unsure... anyone have any ideas? Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this will help... straight from the assignment page:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Your card class should have public getter and setter functions for both of these variables (getValue,\nsetValue, etc), as well as a function that will return a c-string representation of the card. (You can\ncall it toCString if you want.) It should work something as follows:</p>\n\n<p>void toCString(char cardString[])\nINPUT: A character array for storing the output\nOUTPUT: NONE\nThis function should return a character string representing the card object. This string\nmust have the following form: two characters followed by a third null byte. The first character\nrepresents suit; the second represents value. Suits should be “S”, “H”, “C”, or “D” for spades, hearts,</p>\n\n<p>clubs, diamonds. The second character represents value: “A” for Ace, 2-9 for numbered cards, “T” for\n10, “J” for Jack, “Q” for Queen”, “K” for King. Some examples:\n2 of spades = 'S2'\n10 of hearts = 'HT'\nJack of diamonds = 'DJ'\nQueen of clubs = 'CQ'\nAce of spades = 'SA'\netc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In addition to these, you should have at least a default constructor to initialize the values.</strong> You are\nwelcome to create other constructors (perhaps one that initializes a card from it's c-string\nrepresentation?) but it is not required.</p>\n\n<p>Deck Class:\nIn addition to your card class, you will need to create a Deck class to encapsulate all of your card\nobjects. In this object you should have a private member multi-dimensional array (of size SUITS by\nVALUES) of your Card objects. When a Deck object is created, you should have it initialize the multi-\ndimensional array of Cards. Card suits are represented by an enumerated type; card values are\nrepresented by an integer from 1 to 13 (1 is an Ace, 2-10 are numbered values, 11 is the Jack, 12 is the\nQueen, and 13 is the King).</p>\n\n<p>Your constructor should loop over the multi-dimensional array and initialize all values so that the\ncomplete deck of cards is represented.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So maybe you can see why I am confused... I swear I understand these concepts but argh... this is killing me. After this, the rest of the project should be cake I'm confident...</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","homework","phonegap","phonegap-plugins"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2207,"score":0,"question_id":8880814,"title":"How to install phonegap Facebook plugin for iPhone","body":"<p>i'm making a project for school and I want to use the phone gap Facebook plugin for iOS, but the installation instructions in the text file is rather complicated.

One possible way of solving this\n  problem is exhaustive search, or the brute-force approach. In this\n  approach, we test all possible answers, and compare those that are\n  correct solutions to the given problem, in order to find the optimal\n  answer.</p>\n  \n  <p>In particular, for the problem of marking change, given a cash\n  amount in cents, we can first find out for any way of making change\n  correctly (NOT necessarily using as few coins as possible), the\n  maximum numbers of toonies, loonies, etc. that we can use. We can then\n  perform a six-level loop to iterate through all possibles combinations\n  of coins, using the maximum numbers computed before as the upper bound\n  for the corre- sponding coins in any solution. More precisely, in the\n  outermost loop, we iterator the solutions that use 1 toonie, 2\n  toonies, ..., the maximum number of toonies computed. In the second\n  outermost loop, we iterate the solutions that use 1 loonie, 2 loonies,\n  ..., the maximum number of loonies computed (the number of toonies in\n  these solutions is determined in the outermost loop), and so on. In\n  the innermost loop, for each solution, we check whether it is a\n  correct solution for the given cash amount. If it is, then we check\n  whether it uses fewer coins than all the correct solutions that we\n  have seen so far. </p>\n  \n  <p>For example, if the cash amount is 200, then we can\n  use at most 1 toonie, 2 loonies, 8 quarters, 20 dimes, 40 nickels and\n  200 pennies in any solution. We then check the following solutions\n  (each solution contains 6 numbers that are the numbers of coins of\n  eachtypeused,startingfromtoonies):\n  0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,1;0,0,0,0,0,2; ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 200; 0, 0, 0,\n  0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,\n  200; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1; .... In this particular\n  example, any solution that we test should use no more than 1 toonie, 2\n  loonies, 8 quarters, 20 dimes, 40 nickels and 200 pennies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What's it mean by this brute-forceness?

What I was asked to implement is a menu option that allows a user to share a sheet (i.e. the user selects 'share a sheet' - it's the current one - and then selects the area that they wish to share: A1:A9, for example). Then they can specify a local port and the share is created.</p>\n\n<p>The other users who wish to connect to that share will have to know the machine's IP and the port to connect. Once they input that info under a menu option called 'join a shared sheet' then that shared area will appear in their current sheet, and they are free to edit and view what others are typing in those cells.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has read/write access - that must be controlled by threads (because we can have 1 person sharing and 3 peers connected to that sheet, all viewing the changes and making their own). Multiple exclusion will have to be guaranteed (this can be done with Semaphores and/or Reentrantlocks).</p>\n\n<p>The sharing implementation has to implemented in a peer to peer architecture. </p>\n\n<p>Now my question is: how to I start developing with sockets in Java?

First, convert the birthdate to a GregorianCalendar and store it in the person object. Then in the print statement just simply tell the program to format that date as it's being printed. Problem was solved. All works according to specifications now, and I feel that much stupider because I was flailing like a fish out of water for the last day or so with the DateUtil class, trying to get them to work at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help all on getting the date go in properly!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","homework"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":0,"question_id":10333190,"title":"How to input and exception","body":"<p>Ok here is a code I am working on.

Default position for the cube is left upper angle of the board, blue side up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>B B . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(4x4 example, B stands for blue)</p>\n\n<p><strong>There could be stones (obstacles) on the blackboard.</strong>\nMoves I can make with my figure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>rotating it for 90/180/270 degrees clockwise</li>\n<li>you can flip the cube around its right/left/upper/lower edge, changing its ''upward color''</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For an example, using flip right on the default position:</p>\n\n<pre><code>. .

I recall being told that I may need another vector/array that keeps track of squares that I've already visited/checked, but then how would I implement that here exactly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","performance","homework","sorting"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":138,"score":0,"question_id":10767729,"title":"Array sorting effective","body":"<p>i need to write method who can sort array, the sort method should be efficient as possible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning of the array will appear all the numbers that divide by 4 without remainder.</li>\n<li>Will be followed by all the numbers that divide by 4 with remainder of 1</li>\n<li>Will be followed by all the numbers that divide by 4 with remainder of 2</li>\n<li>At the end of the array will all the other numbers (those that divide by four with the remaining three).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I tried this set 4 pointers:\n2 pointers At first the remainder of 0 and 1\n2 pointers at the last of the array for the remainder of 2 and 3</p>\n\n<p>this is what i could find so far (with problem of course), I appreciate your help !</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void sortByFour (int[] arr)\n{\n    int temp;\n    int noRemainderIndex = 0;\n    int remainder1Index = 1;\n    int remainder2Index = arr.length - 2;\n    int remainder3Index = arr.length - 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)\n    {\n        if (arr[i] % 4 == 0)\n        {\n            temp = arr[noRemainderIndex];\n            arr[noRemainderIndex] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            noRemainderIndex++;\n            remainder1Index++;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 1)\n        {\n            temp = arr[remainder1Index];\n            arr[remainder1Index] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder1Index++;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 2)\n        {\n            temp = arr[remainder2Index];\n            arr[remainder2Index] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder2Index--;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 3)\n        {   \n            temp = arr[remainder3Index];\n            arr[remainder3Index] = temp = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder3Index--;\n            remainder2Index--;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","2d-array"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":1,"question_id":10747164,"title":"The Real Size of an 2D Array, (Filled area of 2D array), in Java","body":"<p>I'm having problem with my homework assignment, and hoping to find some help.</p>\n\n<p>I have to read a text file into a 2D int array. \nThe width of the 2D array is fixed at 5 and will never change.

I've got most of them going pretty fast, except for these two, which bugs me so much because they are VERY simply functions. One basically sets all values in a two dimensional array to the same value and one basically swaps the values of two 2-D arrays. And that's the problem. They're taking up the most time but because they're so simple, I can't figure out how to reduce them without breaking the functions. And I know it's possible to make them run faster, because other students in the class have been getting ridiculous speed ups. The two in question are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fSetArray(int rows, int cols, float val)\n{\n    int i, j;\n    F2D *out;\n    out = fMallocHandle(rows, cols);\n\n    for(i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)\n    for(j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)\n        subsref(out,i,j) = val;\n\n    return out;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only important part is the two loops there. Basically, we have a 2-D array with a certain width (rows) and a certain height (cols) and we're setting ALL of the values to val. But there's no way that I can see to eliminate one of the loops (which would be the best way to speed it up). Unless I'm missing something obvious. If cols and rows were the same number, this would be so much easier.</p>\n\n<p>The other function is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fDeepCopy(F2D* in)\n{\n    int i, j;\n    F2D* out;\n    int rows, cols;\n\n    rows = in-&gt;height;\n    cols = in-&gt;width;\n\n    out = fMallocHandle(rows, cols);\n\n    for(i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)\n    for(j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)\n        subsref(out,i,j) = subsref(in,i,j);\n\n    return out;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The out array is always larger than the in array, so we don't have to worry about overflow or such. This function basically just swaps the values of the two arrays, but once again, because it's so simple, I can't quite get it to reduce any further.</p>\n\n<p>And before anyone says parallelization, because of the sample size and server, the overhead required to create the threads actually slows down the program. I've tried. Because these two functions are too short, it's not worth creating the threads only to kill them after one parallel for. </p>\n\n<p>But for reference, yes technically this is an OpenMP project and we're supposed to use parallelization, but for these two functions, doing so actually slows down the whole program. I've timed it with a parallel for loop to check.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks for everyone who gave me ideas!

Also, more importantly, it needs 3 things.  1.Static Evaluation to judge the computer's moves.  2. Move Generator  3. Alpha-Beta Pruining.

For example the CarlH lectures lost me at around unit 5 part 1 and 2 where it jumped the shark and neglected to say how to run, compile, execute code. I got confused and decided to try something else. I tried Invent your own computer games with python though it lost me at around the hangman chapter. I have also tried other things, though there is always that point where it goes \"Here, it is easy! Try this...!\" and of course it is something that in no way I understand.

Here is part of the specs - </p>\n\n<p><em>\"You'll have to do a little thinking to figure out how to get the printed names lined up with all the other columns. The first hint is that it involves joining strings together, something called concatenation. Give it a go, and if you can't figure it out, look at the next document in this folder; it contains additional hints. Part of the purpose of this assignment is to implicitly teach you concatenation. Do NOT use tabs (\\t) and make sure your C/C++ editor does not produce tab characters.\nDo NOT use gets() in this program. Use scanf() for inputting the interactive information. If you try to use gets(), you may get VERY frustrated.\nIn essence, all numbers appearing in the report should be right-justified and decimal-aligned. All numbers appearing in the summary should appear without leading spaces (other than the one which normally separates the number from the previous word). Hourly wage amounts CAN be less than 10.00, so be very careful with your formatting. The sample output can appear correct, but you can still be docked a half-point if things don't align properly with hourly wages under $10.00.\"\nAdditional hints:\n\"You may assume that the employee name is always two names, a first name and a last name separated by a space. Also assume that there are never any spaces within a first name or within a last name. This allows you to use two scanf() calls instead of one gets() call. gets() would introduce some oddities that make things not work correctly later down the line. \nYou may also assume that neither name exceeds 10 characters in length. \nThe input from the Process another employee? question should be a single character. Assume that N or n will stop the loop, but that any other character will continue the loop.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Anyone know how to do this?

Following this line come with a single integer S, which will contain the number of strings to test, then S lines with the respective strings.</p>\n\n<p>the expected output is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case #2:\naaabcccc Rejected\naabbbbcdc Rejected\nabbcdddcc Rejected\nacdddddd Accepted\nabc Accepted\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output resulting in my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case #1:\naaabcccc Rejected\naabbbbcdc Rejected\nabbcdddcc Rejected\nacdddddd Rejected\nabc Rejected\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's my code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n#include &lt;map&gt;\n#include &lt;set&gt;\n#include &lt;utility&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;    \nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef map&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;, char&gt; transitions;\n    transitions trans;\n\n    int  numberFinals;\n    vector&lt;int&gt; currentStates;    \n\nint main (){ \n\n    freopen (\"tarea4.in\", \"r\", stdin);\n    //freopen (\"tarea4.out\", \"w\", stdout);        \n    int testCases, i, j,k, cont=1,finalStates,numberInputs,stateOrigin, stateDestination;\n    int numberStates, numberTransitions, initialState;\n    char transitionCharacter ;\n\n    set&lt;int&gt; current;\n    set&lt;int&gt; next;\n    set&lt;int&gt;::iterator it;\n    set &lt;int&gt; final;\n    std::set&lt;int&gt; the_intersection;  // Destination of intersect\n    map&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;, char&gt;::iterator p;\n    string inputString;\n\n    cin&gt;&gt; testCases;\n    for (i=0;i&lt; testCases;i++){\n        cin&gt;&gt;numberStates&gt;&gt;numberTransitions&gt;&gt;initialState&gt;&gt;numberFinals;\n        current.insert (initialState);\n\n        for (j=0;j&lt;numberFinals;j++){\n            cin&gt;&gt;finalStates;\n            final.insert(finalStates);\n        }\n\n        for (j=0; j&lt;numberTransitions;j++){\n            cin&gt;&gt; stateOrigin&gt;&gt;stateDestination&gt;&gt;transitionCharacter;\n            trans.insert(transitions::value_type(std::make_pair(stateOrigin, stateDestination), transitionCharacter ));\n       }\n\n        cin&gt;&gt;numberInputs;\n\n        cout&lt;&lt;\"Test Case #\"&lt;&lt;cont++&lt;&lt;\":\"&lt;&lt;endl;    \n\n        for (j=0; j&lt;numberInputs;j++){\n             //////////////////the code of the answer /////////////////\n            current.insert (initialState);\n            cin&gt;&gt; inputString;\n            cout&lt;&lt;inputString&lt;&lt;\" \";\n\n\n     for (k=0; k&lt;str.size();k++){\n         next.clear();\n         for ( it=current.begin() ; it != current.end(); it++ ){\n              for (q= trans.begin(); q!= trans.end();q++){\n                  if((*it == q-&gt;first.first)&amp;&amp;(str[k]==q-&gt;second)){\n                     next.insert(q-&gt;first.second);\n                   }\n              current=next;\n              }\n         }\n     }\n\n            std::set_intersection(current.begin(), current.end(), final.begin(), final.end(), std::inserter(the_intersection, the_intersection.end()));\n\n            if (the_intersection.size()&gt;0){\n                cout&lt;&lt; \"Accepted\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n            }\n            else{\n                cout&lt;&lt; \"Rejected\"&lt;&lt;endl;\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        printf (\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is: Why do I get incorrect output?

Basically we need to write an abstract base class from which other (non abstract) classes inherit, the header file of the abstract base class looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//AbstractBase.h \nclass AbstractBase\n{\n    public:\n        AbstractBase();\n        virtual int operator+ (int)=0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have no idea what to put in the implementation .cpp file since it's an abstract class (so you can't create any objects from that class, I'm probably very very wrong here) so I just didn't make one.</p>\n\n<p>Then there's the derived class with a header file and implementation as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Headerfile for DerivedClass\n#include \"AbstractBase.h\"\nclass DerivedClass: public AbstractBase\n{\n    public:\n        DerivedClass(double &amp;);\n        DerivedClass * operator+ (DerivedClass*);\n        double getVar();\n        void setVar(double)\n    private:\n        double Var;\n}\n\n//Implementation of DerivedClass\n#include \"DerivedClass.h\"\nclass DerivedClass::DerivedClass(double &amp;Input) :Var(Input)\n{}\n\ndouble DerivedClass::getVar()\n{\n    return Var;\n}\n\nvoid DerivedClass::setVar(double Input)\n{\n    Var=Input;\n}\n\nDerivedClass * DerivedClass::operator+ (DerivedClass * object)\n{\n    double Sum;\n    Sum=Var+object-&gt;getVar()\n    DerivedClass result(Sum);\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my question comes down to this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the overloading part (last lines) should do the following: when I add\ntwo object of the class DerivedClass, it should just add the private\nvariables (double Var) together. I've done some searching but\ncouldn't immediately find something that I could use (perhaps because\nof my limited knowledge on this matter).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A small side question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>what do I do with the AbstractBase class? My task description states\nthat it should only contain 4 virtual functions that are all\noverloading an operator. But it's an abstract base class and I don't\nknow yet HOW I would overload them (i.e. it's like saying \"add two\nthings, I have no idea how but I know you can add em up...\", that's\nall the abstract class says)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Edit: some clarification on how I think it should happen.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract base class contains a virtual function operator+. In the derived class, I define a new operator+ which knows how to handle the addition of objects of the derived class. If I use a pointer of the type DerivedClass* it will ignore the virtual function and go for the operator+ function defined in the DerivedClass (the basic principle of virtual functions?). The problem seems that the derived class is still seen as an abstract class, so I can't use the code provided by Component 10, because that instantiates an object of DerivedClass (which isn't possible because apparently it's abstract)</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: </p>\n\n<p>Our professor decided to leave out the operator overloading because it involved too complex code :D Thanks for the help anyway, I did learn how to correctly implement it (sort of).</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","swing","combobox","awt"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":138,"score":1,"question_id":10474836,"title":"More on ComboBox","body":"<p>I have a final coming up and one of the points my professor stressed was ComboBoxes.

And my idea is to find the highest number from numbers standing on the left side of the \"4\", and a minimum from ones standing on the right side of \"4\". \nAnd if left_max>right_min, we have our \"231 scheme\". </p>\n\n<p>For example permutation 1342: left_max=3, right_min=2, so it's correct \"231\" and we reject that from final answer.</p>\n\n<p>I'd be very thankful for any comments, ideas and tips. I realize that my idea may be useless, but that's the best I have.

How do I do that?","body":"<p>It's for homework for my Data Structures class, and it's in Java.</p>\n\n<p>I have to make this little game sort of thing; the world is made up of a graph, and some nodes hold items that, when found, will be added to the user's inventory, which is a binary search tree. (It has to be a binary search tree, or else this would be much easier.) I have most of it figured out, but I need the user to be able to see and access the contents of the inventory tree thing. The binary tree node class I'm provided has an inorderPrint() method that uses recursion to print everything out, but that only helps for showing them the contents, not giving them an easy way to access them. I want to have a method that returns an array of binary search tree nodes so I can do something like this in main...</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>int i = 0;\nint choice;\nSystem.out.println(\"# - Item\\tPoints\"); //Will appear as # - Item     Points\nfor (BTNode node : inventory.treeAsArray()) {\n    System.out.printf(\"%d - %s\\t%d\\n\", i, node.getData().getName(),\n                      node.getData().getPoints()); //example: 1 - Poo    100\n    i++;\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Select the number of the item you want to remove: \");\nchoice = keyboard.nextInt();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then I'd loop through the array again and remove the item that corresponds with the number the user inputs.

I got through the first assignment fairly easily, and I'm trying to do the extra credit for the assignment now. I'm stuck however at one of the extra credit questions:</p>\n\n<p><em>Implement a user-interface for choosing whether the operand to sin() or cos() is\nconsidered radians or degrees. When you call sin(x) in the C library, x is assumed\nto be in radians (i.e. 0 to 2π goes around the circle once), but users might want to\nenter 180 and press the sin button and get 0 instead of -0.8012 (which is the sine of\n180 radians). You could use a UIButton for this and switch out the titleLabel’s\ntext each time the UIButton is pressed, but a better way would be to see if you can\nfigure out how to use a UISwitch by reading the documentation (if you dare!).</em></p>\n\n<p>I implemented a UISwitch and hooked it up as an IBOutlet. When I perform an 'operation', I check if the switch is on or off and pass this to my model along with the operation to perform. In my sin and cos cases, I do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>else if ([operation isEqual:@\"sin\"])\n{\n    if (radians) {\n        operand = sin(operand);\n    }\n    else {\n        operand = sin(operand) * (180 / M_PI);\n    }\n\n}\n// similar for cos\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If <code>radians</code> (which is a BOOL: YES = radians, no = degrees), then I perform the operation as usually; if the user puts the switch to 'degrees', I want to return the value in degrees, as the assignment states: <em>users might want to enter 180 and press the sin button and get 0 instead of -0.8012 (which is the sine of 180 radians).</em></p>\n\n<p>However, this code doesn't fully work. When I put the switch to degrees and do <code>sin 180</code> it returns a value of more or less <code>-45</code>. Something is wrong there; and I'm not really sure what. I have looked up how to do the conversion and I think I'm doing it right, but apparently not.</p>\n\n<p>I realise this is perhaps better suited for math.stackexchange, but since there was some code I wanted to post I put it here. Can someone provide some advice on the best way to implement this? It's been a while since I even worked with cos or sin, radians and degrees.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","homework","segmentation-fault","printf","token"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":97,"score":2,"question_id":10464930,"title":"about segmentation fault in LINUX","body":"<p>I am doing a homework developing SIC/XE assembler in LINUX.</p>\n\n<p>When I made a code, I confronted some error, but I do not know why this is happen.

I also want this to create an entry in the orders table and redirect the client to the order confirm page which will display the details of the order.<br/>\nHere is my code which runs when the submit button is clicked on the order form. <br/><br/>\nEDIT I've fixed the error with the missing apostrophe. <br/> Attempting to insert using two sql commands as I've been told that access databases can't handle two at once.  Still getting an error though. </p>\n\n<pre><code>  Protected Sub btnAddRecord_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)\n\n    Dim strFirstName As String\n    Dim strLastName As String\n    Dim strEmailAdd As String\n    Dim intCardNo As String\n    Dim strCardEx As String\n    Dim intSortCode As String\n    Dim strDeliveryAdd As String\n    Dim strPostCode As String\n    Dim intProductID As Integer\n    strFirstName = tbxFirstName.Text\n    strLastName = tbxLastName.Text\n    strEmailAdd = tbxEmailAdd.Text\n    intCardNo = tbxCardNo.Text\n    strCardEx = tbxCardEx.Text\n    intSortCode = tbxSortCode.Text\n    strDeliveryAdd = tbxDeliveryAdd.Text\n    strPostCode = tbxPostcode.Text\n    intProductID = ddlProduct.SelectedValue\n\n    Dim strDatabaseNameAndLocation As String\n    strDatabaseNameAndLocation = Server.MapPath(\"KingToots.mdb\")\n    Dim strSQLCommand As String\n    strSQLCommand = \"INSERT INTO Customer(FirstName, LastName, EmailAdd, CardNo, CardEx, SortCode, DeliveryAdd, Postcode) \" &amp; _\n        \"Values ('\" &amp; strFirstName &amp; \"', '\" &amp; strLastName &amp; \"', '\" &amp; strEmailAdd &amp; \"', '\" &amp; intCardNo &amp; \"', '\" &amp; strCardEx &amp; \"', '\" &amp; intSortCode &amp; \"', '\" &amp; strDeliveryAdd &amp; \"', '\" &amp; strPostCode &amp; \"');\"\n    Dim objOleDbConnection As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection\n    objOleDbConnection = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection(\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.Oledb.4.0; Data Source=\" &amp; strDatabaseNameAndLocation)\n    objOleDbConnection.Open()\n    Dim objOleDbCommand As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand\n    objOleDbCommand = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand(strSQLCommand, objOleDbConnection)\n    objOleDbCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()\n    objOleDbConnection.Close()\n    strSQLCommand = \"INSERT INTO Orders(ProductID) \" &amp; \"Values ('\" &amp; intProductID &amp; \"');\"\n    objOleDbConnection = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection(\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.Oledb.4.0; Data Source=\" &amp; strDatabaseNameAndLocation)\n    objOleDbConnection.Open()\n    objOleDbCommand = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand(strSQLCommand, objOleDbConnection)\n    objOleDbCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()\n    objOleDbConnection.Close()\n    strSQLCommand = \"SELECT Customer.* FROM Customer ORDER BY Customer.CustomerID DESC;\"\n    objOleDbConnection = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection(\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.Oledb.4.0; Data Source=\" &amp; strDatabaseNameAndLocation)\n    objOleDbConnection.Open()\n    objOleDbCommand = New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand(strSQLCommand, objOleDbConnection)\n    Dim objOleDbDataReader As System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataReader\n    objOleDbDataReader = objOleDbCommand.ExecuteReader()\n    Dim datDataTable As System.Data.DataTable\n    datDataTable = New System.Data.DataTable()\n    datDataTable.Load(objOleDbDataReader)\n    objOleDbConnection.Close()\n    tbxFirstName.Text = \"\"\n    tbxLastName.Text = \"\"\n    tbxEmailAdd.Text = \"\"    \n    tbxCardNo.Text = \"\"\n    tbxCardEx.Text = \"\"\n    tbxSortCode.Text = \"\"\n    tbxDeliveryAdd.Text = \"\"\n    tbxPostcode.Text = \"\"\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","homework","dictionary"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":2,"question_id":10452263,"title":"More trouble with Python - Dictionary/Database key value retrieval","body":"<p>So, as stated in a previous (but different) question, I'm trying to figure out a 'simple' dictionary/database with Python, which will retrieve a name from a list of ten, with the requested information. i.e. input could be 'John phone', where the output is 'John's phone number is 0401' (which I have down pat); but I could also input 'John Birthday' or 'John hobbies' and the output would correspond.</p>\n\n<p>So far, this is what I have. \nAs I'm a complete noob, I'm not even sure where to start.

The second is a customer class representing the individual receiving the loan.  The requirements for each class are as follows:\n1.  Each class must have at least 2 members and 2 methods.\n2.  The customer class must store the customer’s name, phone number, and date of birth at a minimum.\n3.  The loan class must store the contract number, date of execution, and the associated customer at a minimum.\n4.  When assigning the customer object into the loan object, the customer must be at least 21 yrs old.

Can someone help me or point me in the right direction or something? Here is the exercise:</p>\n\n<p>Exercise 12.5 The goal of this exercise is to write a program that generates\nrandom poker hands and classifies them, so that we can estimate the probability of\nthe various poker hands. Don’t worry if you don’t play poker; I’ll tell you everything\nyou need to know.</p>\n\n<p>a. As a warmup, write a program that uses shuffleDeck and subdeck to generate\nand print four random poker hands with five cards each. Did you get anything\ngood? Here are the possible poker hands, in increasing order of value:\npair: two cards with the same rank\ntwo pair: two pairs of cards with the same rank\nthree of a kind: three cards with the same rank\nstraight: five cards with ranks in sequence\nflush: five cards with the same suit\nfull house: three cards with one rank, two cards with another\nfour of a kind: four cards with the same rank\nstraight flush: five cards in sequence and with the same suit</p>\n\n<p>b. Write a method called isFlush that takes a Deck as a parameter and returns a\nboolean indicating whether the hand contains a flush.</p>\n\n<p>c. Write a method called isThreeKind that takes a hand and returns a boolean\nindicating whether the hand contains Three of a Kind.</p>\n\n<p>d. Write a loop that generates a few thousand hands and checks whether they\ncontain a flush or three of a kind. Estimate the probability of getting one of\nthose hands.</p>\n\n<p>e. Write methods that test for the other poker hands. Some are easier than others.\nYou might find it useful to write some general-purpose helper methods that can\nbe used for more than one test.</p>\n\n<p>f.

The answer key and a student's answer to a question could be a digit, between 1 and 5 (inclusive), or a character among A, B, C, D, E, F and T, or lower case equivalent.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;iomanip&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\n\nvoid ReadAnswers (char AnsweKey[], int NumOfQuestions);\nvoid ProcessOneSection(int NumOfQuestions, int NumOfStudentsInClass, char AnsweKey[], int passed); \nvoid ProcessAnswer(char AnswerKey[], char Answers[], int NumOfQuestions, int &amp;Good, bool &amp;PassFail);\nvoid UpdateTotal(int NumOfStudentsInClass, int NumOfSections, int TotalNumOfStudents);\nvoid DisplayResult(string name, int good, bool PassFail);\nconst int MaxQuestions = 50;\nconst int NameSize = 50;\n\nint main(){\n\n    int NumOfQuestions, NumOfStudentsInClass, NumOfSections, passed;\n    int TotalNumOfStudents = 0; \n    int TotalPassed = 0;\n\n    char AnswerKey [MaxQuestions];\n    cin &gt;&gt; NumOfQuestions;\n    ReadAnswers (AnswerKey, NumOfQuestions);\n    cin &gt;&gt; NumOfSections;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumOfQuestions; i++){\n        ProcessOneSection(NumOfQuestions, NumOfStudentsInClass, passed, AnswerKey);\n        UpdateTotal(NumOfStudentsInClass, NumOfSections, TotalNumOfStudents);\n    }\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"How many students passed \";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid ReadAnswers (char AnsweKey[], int NumOfQuestions){\n    char AnswerKey[50];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumOfQuestions; i++){\n        cin &gt;&gt; AnswerKey[i];\n    }\n}\n\nvoid ProcessOneSection(int NumOfQuestions, int NumOfStudentsInClass, char AnsweKey[], int passed){\n    char Answers [MaxQuestions];\n    char AnswerKey[50];\n    string name;\n    int CorrectCount = 0;\n    bool PassFail;\n    int Good;\n    //header();\n    cin &gt;&gt; NumOfStudentsInClass;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumOfStudentsInClass; i++){\n        ReadAnswers(Answers, NumOfQuestions);\n        ProcessAnswer(AnswerKey, Answers, NumOfQuestions, Good, PassFail);\n        DisplayResult(name, Good, PassFail);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid ProcessAnswer(char AnswerKey[], char Answers[], int NumOfQuestions, int &amp;Good, bool &amp;PassFail){\n    Good = 0;\n    bool TrueFalse;\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; NumOfQuestions ; i++){\n        if (toupper(AnswerKey[i]) == toupper(Answers[i])){\n            Good++;\n        }\n        if ((Good/NumOfQuestions) &gt;= 60){\n        TrueFalse = true;\n        }\n        else{\n            TrueFalse = false;  \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid UpdateTotal(int NumOfStudentsInClass, int NumOfSections, int TotalNumOfStudents){\n    int TotalPassed, passed;\n    TotalNumOfStudents += NumOfStudentsInClass;\n    TotalPassed += passed;\n}\n\nvoid DisplayResult(string name, int Good, bool PassFail){\n    //cout &lt;&lt; setpression &lt;&lt; endl;\n    cout &lt;&lt; setw(NameSize) &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; setw (12) &lt;&lt; Good &lt;&lt; setw(12);\n    if (PassFail){\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"pass\";\n    }\n    else{\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"fail\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","homework","methods","swap"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":0,"question_id":10359574,"title":"I keep receiving a .class expected error","body":"<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong and I'm just starting to learn arrays.

I was hoping you guys could help out. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Professors Instructions:</p>\n\n<p>In your program, you need two exceptions to handle two kinds of bad data. For the non-integer reading, you can use nextInt() method to read an integer from the file, if the data is not an integer, InputMismatchException will be thrown. Your program must catch this exception. To handle the negative reading, you may want to declare your own Exception class: BPIllegalValueException (you are expected to write BPIllegalValueException.java that contains the class), and threw this exception when a negative value is read. Note: your program should not terminate when a bad data is read. Therefore, you must use try/catch block to handle the bad data. Your program is expected to print out (on the screen) the number of good BP readings and the number of bad data.</p>\n\n<p>My code is as follows: </p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class DemoEx {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException\n{\n    FileReader fr = new FileReader(\"BP.txt\");\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\n    Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"BP.txt\"));\n    int badData = 0;\n    int goodData = 0;\n    int data;\n    String str = \"\";\n\n    while((str = br.readLine()) != null)\n    {   \n        try\n        {\n            data = in.nextInt();\n            if(data&gt;0)\n                goodData++;\n            else if(data&lt;0)\n                throw new BPIllegalValueException(data);\n            else\n                throw new InputMismatchException();\n        }\n\n        catch(InputMismatchException ex)\n        {\n            badData++;\n        }\n\n        catch(BPIllegalValueException ex)\n        {\n            badData++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(\"The number of good data: \" + goodData);\n    System.out.println(\"The number of bad data: \" + badData);\n\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","homework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":0,"question_id":10335679,"title":"InvalidCastException was unhandled in C#","body":"<p>Ok I have been working on this for many days and I know I am getting close to finishing it up but I keep getting errors.

The reason I have to do this is for a class assignment. The whole point is to learn to use pointer arithmetic without \"cheater indexing\" (pointer + i), where i would be the index as such: array[i].</p>\n\n<p>Before I call my sort function, I allocate an array of 1000 structures. The typedef is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef struct\n{\n    char* name;\n    char* art;\n    int rating;\n} ENTRY;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The idea is that i read a file containing ASCII art. Each piece of art gets thrown into its own struct. Here's a single \"entry\" from the text file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Jean Pajerek\n  |\\_____/|\n  |[o] [o]|\n  |   V   |\n  |       |\n -ooo---ooo-\n# 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's an owl! But what I need to do is store the name, art and rating in its appropriate field of the struct. My read function works perfectly. I allocate the array of 1000 structs, then just read the text file into it. It only contains like 18 images, so no worries there.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's talk about my selection sort function. I started by taking a look at the selection sort algo for arrays of ints using index notation, then I tried to adapt it to my requirements. \n1) use pointer arithmetic\n2) moving around structures instead of ints</p>\n\n<p>So here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void sort(ENTRY* aryptr, int* counter)\n{\n    ENTRY* slow;\n    ENTRY* fast;\n    ENTRY* lastmin;\n    ENTRY min;\n    ENTRY temp;\n    int i;\n    int j;\n\n    printf(\"\\n\\n...SORTING\\n\\n\\n\");\n\n    slow = aryptr;\n\n    for (i=0; i &lt; *counter - 2; i++)\n    {\n        min = *slow;        \n\n        fast = slow + 1;\n        for (j = i + 1; j &lt; *counter-1; j++)\n        {\n            if (strcmp(fast-&gt;name, min.name) &lt; 0 )\n            {\n                min = *fast;\n                lastmin = fast;\n            }\n            fast++;           \n        }\n\n        temp = *slow;\n        *slow = min;\n        *lastmin = temp;\n\n   slow++;      \n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm using i and j as counters because I felt that testing for something like walker->name != NULL was unsafe. (Should I be trying to use a NULL test anyway? It does seem more \"logically satisfying\" to me, IF I can guarantee the thing after the last element is, in fact, NULL...) Regardless of what I use to track my locations for the slow and fast pointers, I have an issue with the sort.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is like this: I have this art.txt file with a bunch of different pieces of art.  Some pieces of art are by the SAME person.</p>\n\n<pre><code>VOLDEMORT\n(art is hippogryph)\n# 1\nEDDARD STARK\n(art is turtle)\n# 4\nEDDARD STARK\n(art is owl)\n# 3   \nTONY STARK\n(art is blob)\n#1\nEDDARD STARK\n(art is dragon)\n#5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I finish sorting, pieces of art by the same author will be next to each other in the array. I don't care about the order of the art by the same person. Assume I sort it with my code: I get something like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>EDDARD STARK\n(art is turtle)\n# 4\nEDDARD STARK\n(art is owl)\n# 3      \nEDDARD STARK\n(art is dragon)\n#5\nEDDARD STARK\n(art is turtle)\n# 4\nTONY STARK\n(art is blob)\n#1\nVOLDEMORT\n(art is hippogryph)\n# 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The sorted block of art by EDDARD STARK will have a copy of the FIRST PIECE OF ART in that block at the END. I've looked at my logic, printed various things to debug, but I still can't figure out where the problem is. I think I just won't be able to see it because I've looked at my own damn code so long.

Here is what I am suppose to do.</p>\n\n<p>•Add a textbox named txtFilePath &lt;--- already have that</p>\n\n<p>•Add a button next to the above textbox that says “Load” (name it appropriately)&lt;-already have that</p>\n\n<p>•Add a button that says “Save” (name it appropriately) &lt;-- already have this </p>\n\n<p>•When thebutton “Load” is clicked, read the file specified in the textbox\n (txtFilePath: Absolute path not relative) and add the objects found\n within to the listbox&lt;--- Not understanding</p>\n\n<p>•When the user clicks the “Save” button, write the selected record to\n the file specified in txtFilePath (absolute path not relative) without\n truncating the values currently inside&lt;-- not understanding</p>\n\n<p>Here is the one part of code I have:` </p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n\n        private void addButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            EditDialog newEmployeeDialog = new EditDialog();\n            if (newEmployeeDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)\n            {\n                employeeList.Items.Add(newEmployeeDialog.StaffMember);\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void deleteButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (employeeList.SelectedIndex == -1)\n                return;\n\n            if (MessageBox.Show(\"Really delete this employee\",\n                \"Delete\", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo,\n                    MessageBoxIcon.Question)\n            == DialogResult.Yes)\n            {\n                employeeList.Items.Remove(\n                    employeeList.SelectedItem);\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void editButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (employeeList.SelectedIndex == -1)\n                return;\n\n            int employeeNum = employeeList.SelectedIndex;\n            EditDialog newEmployeeDialog = new EditDialog();\n            newEmployeeDialog.StaffMember =\n                (Employee)employeeList.SelectedItem;\n\n            if (newEmployeeDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)\n            {\n                employeeList.Items.RemoveAt(employeeNum);\n                employeeList.Items.Insert(employeeNum, newEmployeeDialog.StaffMember);\n                employeeList.SelectedIndex = employeeNum;\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void employeeList_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (employeeList.SelectedIndex != -1)\n            {\n                Employee currentEmployee = (Employee)employeeList.SelectedItem;\n                firstName.Text = currentEmployee.FirstName;\n                lastName.Text = currentEmployee.LastName;\n                jobTitle.Text = currentEmployee.JobTitle;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                firstName.Text = lastName.Text = jobTitle.Text = \"\";\n            }\n        }\n`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I know you can not see the button click but I do have them mark. I know when you use open and save how it works. How I can go about this? I would use stream writer right.I understand that the user will type the path into the textbox and when the user hits load, it will load the file that they are specified. Now I am just trying to understand a code to be able to word this right.</p>\n\n<p>would it be something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>String filePath = this.txtFilePath.Text;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>since I need to name the textbox txtFilePath. I know some of you might say this is simple but when you are first learning it don't seem that simple. I have been trying something to help me understand since I do my college from home. Thank you for reading hoping to hear from you guys. </p>\n\n<p>Update: Would it be something like this</p>\n\n<p>Reading a file</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void Load_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{ \nStreamReader myReader = new StreamReader(C:\\\\\")\ntxtFilePath.Text = my reader.read to end();\nmyReader.Close();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then there is writing a file</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\nStreamWriter myWriter = new StreamWriter(\"C:\\\\test.txt\", true);\n            myWriter.Write(\"Some text\");\n            myWriter.WriteLine(\"Write a line\");\n            myWriter.WriteLine(\"Line 2\");\n            myWriter.Close();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If this is correct then I have to get it where if the file is not there for the notepad to pop up so they can add it then they can save it without deleting anything out the file or files.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","homework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":247,"score":0,"question_id":10298705,"title":"Find summation of multiple 4 in C++","body":"<p>I have homework to design a form.<br>\nI had problem with the sum.

Alright - looking at the first bit of code, PropTextWithMap, I am currently attempting to traverse a large text file (a book actually, Alice in Wonderland), and store a specified string length nGram from beginning to end into a Map (MyMap) as the key, and the character that follows as the value the key points to.  It appears to work correctly - I run with it for a little while in the Debugger, and it works fine.</p>\n\n<p>But then I run into a little issue when attempting to access the value of one of the keys.  Logic dictates that eventually there will be some overlap - that one of these keys will end up holding multiple values (which is why the value is an ArrayList that is updated when a new value is added).  The problem is, when I attempt to use the picknGramAndPrint, it is able to find the nGram the first time within the map, but it will always print 'D' for some odd reason (it is supposed to print a random value found in the relative ArrayList).  And then, it is unable to find the next nGram (the previous minus the first letter plus the letter chosen from the ArrayList).  I cannot for the life of my figure out why.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, either the bloody thing isn't storing the values in the ArrayList correctly - which it seems too - or it isn't traversing the map correctly.

In the loop the input is the ID ( not two ID's should be the same ), plus or minus ( determine if its allocate or deallocate), and size of allocation ( will be increased to the next power of 2 if needed).</p>\n\n<p>sample input:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 + 256\n1 - \n4 + 78\n4 -\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is what I have for code right now.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.*;\nimport java.io.*;\n\nclass Memory\n{\n    private int ID;\n    private char type;\n    private int addr = 0;\n    private int size;\n    private int potsize;\n\n    public Memory()\n    {\n    }\n    public Memory( int ID, char type, int size, int potsize)\n    {\n            this.ID = ID;\n            this.type = type;\n            this.size = size;\n            this.potsize = potsize;\n    }\n    public void updateAddress(int num)\n    {\n            addr = num;\n    }\n    public int getID()\n    {\n            return ID;\n    }\n    public int getAddress()\n    {\n            return addr;\n    }\n    public int getSize()\n    {\n            return size;\n    }\n    public char getType()\n    {\n            return type;\n    }\n    public int getPotSize()\n    {\n            return potsize;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class prog3\n{\n    static Queue&lt;Memory&gt; deferred = new LinkedList&lt;Memory&gt;();\n    static List list = new LinkedList();\n    static Memory[] m = new Memory[1000];\n    static int MSIZE, ASIZE, i, j = 0, ID, size;\n    static char type;\n    static String sym;\n    static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    public static int powerOfTwo(int num)\n    {\n            int pot = ASIZE;\n\n            if( num &lt; pot )\n            {\n                    return pot;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                    while(num &gt; pot)\n                    {\n                            pot = pot * 2;\n                    }\n                    return pot;\n            }\n    }\n\n    public static void input()\n    {\n            ID = input.nextInt();\n            sym = input.next();\n            type = sym.charAt(0);\n\n            if(type == '+')\n            {\n                    type = 'a';\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                    type = 'd';\n            }\n\n            size = input.nextInt();\n            potsize = powerOfTwo(size);\n\n            m[j] = new Memory(ID,type,size,potsize);\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String args[])\n    {\n            System.out.printf(\"Enter memory size and minimum allocation size: \\n\");\n            MSIZE = input.nextInt();\n            ASIZE = input.nextInt();\n\n            //for( i = 1; MSIZE &gt; ASIZE*i; ++i )\n            //{\n            //      list.add(ASIZE*num);\n            //}\n\n            for(j = 0;j &lt; 4; ++j)\n            {\n                    input();\n            }\n            for( j = 0; j &lt; 4; ++j)\n            {\n                    System.out.printf(\"%d  %s  %d\\n\", m[j].getID(), m[j].getType(), m[j].getSize());\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c++","homework","file","iostream","address"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":1,"question_id":10184905,"title":"Beginning Address Endless Loop","body":"<p>I'm trying to get the beginning address of each line of my file as I read it, and print it out to the screen, but for some reason it just results in an endless loop.

That leads me to a few follow-up questions.</p>\n\n<p>Before going dynamic, I played around with initializing the array, _scores, by trying to give it the size value that was supposed to already be initialized. This led to compiler problems. I talked with my teacher about that, and he said that you can't allocate space for an array unless there's a hardwired global constant. That is, you can't pass a size value in the constructor to initialize an array. Is that true, and if so, why? </p>\n\n<p>Stepping back a bit, it seems to me that dynamic arrays are better if you need a lot of values, because then you don't need a contiguous block of space in memory. So if you are making small arrays, it seems like a waste of space and time typing to make dynamic arrays. Is this untrue? Should I be doing all arrays from now on as dynamic? This experience certainly changed my opinion on the utility of regular arrays, at least as they pertain to classes. </p>\n\n<p>Also, though I got full credit on the assignment, I feel like I violated the spirit by passing an argument for size (since the literal problem statement reads: \"The class constructor should accept an array of test scores as its argument\"). Aside from a hardwired global constant or having a size argument, is there a way to pass just the array? I swear I spent a good hour trying to think of a way to do this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","data-structures","linked-list"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":337,"score":0,"question_id":10194671,"title":"Implementing generic linkedlist add method java","body":"<p>I am trying to implement the add method for the linkedlist , it should take any data type, but I am kind of lost and is not working, any help will be appreciated.</p>\n\n<pre><code> public class LinkedList &lt;T&gt;extends AbstractList  {\n\n private class Node {\n\n    T data;\n    Node next;\n\n    Node(T data, Node next) {\n        this.data = data;\n        this.next = next;\n    }\n\n    Node(T data) {\n        this(data, null);\n    }\n}\nNode first;\nNode last;\n\npublic LinkedList() {\n    first = null;\n    last = null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean add(T item) {\n\n    Node newNode = new Node((T)item);\n\n    if (isEmpty()) {\n        first = newNode;\n        last = first;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    last.next = newNode;\n    last = null;\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","web-applications","nlp"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":203,"score":0,"question_id":5813774,"title":"run a java program with lingpipe classes on a website?","body":"<p>I am working on a text classification project for a class and I am having some difficulties setting it up correctly.

The problem here is that I really just flat out don't understand interfaces or what they are used for (the professor was not very good about explaining it). The assignment was to make a \"Vehicle\" superclass, and than three subclasses, something like \"Truck\" or \"Jeep\" that would each have a couple traits of their own. The \"Vehicle\" class must implement the comparable interface, which I think I have figured out (I have the compareTo() method written comparing the number of doors on vehicles), and one other class must also implement the \"Hybrid\" class (I have no idea what this means). We then have to implement the toSting(), equals(Object o), and compareTo(Object o) methods. Like I said I think I have the compareTo() down, but with the equals() I have no idea. The last thing we have to do is write a Main to test, this involves making an array of Vehicle objects, printing them out, sorting them, and then re printing them. It should also iterate through the array and print out the price premium for hybrids, and use the equals(Object o) method to compare 2 Vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for my \"Vehicle\" superclass</p>\n\n<pre><code>package vehicle;\n\nabstract public class Vehicle implements Comparable {\n    private String color;\n    private int numberOfDoors;\n\n    // Constructor\n    /**\n     * Creates a vehicle with a color and number of doors\n     * @param aColor The color of the vehicle\n     * @param aNumberOfDoors The number of doors\n     */\n    public Vehicle(String aColor, int aNumberOfDoors) {\n        this.color = aColor;\n        this.numberOfDoors = aNumberOfDoors;\n    }\n\n    // Getters\n    /**\n     * Gets the color of the vehicle\n     * @return The color of the vehicle\n     */\n    public String getColor() {return(this.color);}\n    /**\n     * Gets the number of doors the vehicle has\n     * @return The number of doors the vehicle has\n     */\n    public int getNumberOfDoors() {return(this.numberOfDoors);}\n\n    // Setters\n    /**\n     * Sets the color of the vehicle\n     * @param colorSet The color of the vehicle\n     */\n    public void setColor(String colorSet) {this.color = colorSet;}\n    /**\n     * Sets the number of doors for the vehicle\n     * @param numberOfDoorsSet The number of doors to be set to the vehicle\n     */\n    public void setNumberOfDoors(int numberOfDoorsSet) {this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoorsSet;}\n\n    @Override\n    public int compareTo(Object o) {\n        if (o instanceof Vehicle) {\n            Vehicle v = (Vehicle)o;\n            return this.numberOfDoors - v.getNumberOfDoors();\n        }\n        else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Returns a short string describing the vehicle\n     * @return a description of the vehicle\n     */\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        String answer = \"The car's color is \"+this.color\n                +\".

How I'm setting up the rooms is with a parent abstract room class that each room will inherit from and configure. For exits, a room will just invoke an addExit method and pass it an exit object. The game should have only one instance of every room. The exit object should have a target field pointing to one of the game's rooms that gets initialized in the constructor. My problem is I don't know how to pass the exit constructor a pre-existing room reference and not a new room object. The way I see it, there are two possible ways. The first is to directly pass the exit constructor a reference to the room instance. The second is to have a static class that keeps track of all the room instances and has methods that returns an instance from string names or class etc. The exit object's constructor is then passed a way to identify the target room, say a unique string name, which the object constructor then uses to call one of the static class's methods that return room instances.

C++, WaitForSingleObject and Synchronization","body":"<p>So, I'm trying to make a simple multi-threaded program that validates the Collatz Conjecture for a large set of numbers and returns the total amount of validated numbers. Each thread (total 4) does an interval of numbers and updates the \"validated\" variable when a number reaches 1. I'm also timing the entire process (to compare vs a single threaded computation)</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm having is that there is never any consistency when I print out the \"validated\" int at the end of the program, so I am guessing that either the threads are writing over each other, or the main thread is completing before the others, thus printing an incomplete number. I'm also assuming that the clock() calculations will be off too, if the main thread is completing before the others. So, how do I STOP the main thread from continuing until the other threads are completed (thus making it wait for a updated validated count and complete an accurate time measurement)? This is what I thought WaitForSingleObject did, but I'm guessing it just stops the main thread from EXITING, still allowing it to compute its other functions.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first go at any multi-threading, and I don't think I quite understand the workings of synchronization and the WaitForSingleObject command. Here is what I have so far in my main function:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>EDIT: Here is my updated Main function and Collatz function. I modified it so that each thread is accessing a separate variable to avoid the synchronization issue, but the problem still persists. There is no consistent value when I print out \"validated\" *</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>EDIT AGAIN: Alright, so I removed the \"thread\" int per Mladen Janković, and just used a simple counter to distribute the different intervals to the created threads. There is now a consistent, correct value for \"validated\". HOWEVER, I still cannot get the program to actually finish when there are 1,000,000 numbers. Testing it for 100,000 or even 10,000 works flawlessly, but when I up it to 1,000,000 numbers, the program runs indefinitely (hours) without actually returning a values. I'm guessing that it is getting stuck at a particular value (eg 750831 as Martin James pointed out). I tried substituting int for  long int, but it seems that it still suffers from overflow.

I have a few elements added in but have no idea how to implement them. The game has a GUI and I need to have 5 cards for the player and 5 for the dealer (house) and I need them to have pictures for the cards. I know there is a lot of code missing here, as this is my first time doing something of this caliber. I only require that there be a hit and stay button which does the obvious.Ii'm not sure how to get the code to initiate the actions for the buttons. I have an array in, but don't have it being used anywhere because I don't understand how. I have the cards values entered in as well and am not sure how to get the score. I know a nested if statement is required here in order to decide if the dealer continues. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I hope I gave enough information.

We had to do this using a linear search and then a binary search, with an array of 100 elements then 1k then 10k then 100k and 1m elements.  Most of us in the class noticed it took longer on the linear search for 10k elements than 100k elements.  </p>\n\n<p>Mine included a loop where after both searches were finished, the array was expanded and depopulated so it isn't an issue with the code.  This only occurred at that size and it didn't matter if other programs were running or not.

Based on the way it is facing, mazeTraversal attempts to determine if there is an open path to the right, then in front, then to the left, and then behind and to then put an X in that position and change the way the x is facing. Something goes wrong after the second move when I run the program. Thanks for any help, and sorry if this is not the place for such questions. </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nvoid mazePrint(char *maze[12][12]);\nvoid mazeTraversal(char *maze[12][12]);\nstatic int face = 6;\n\nmain()\n{\n    int i = 0;\n    int j = 0;

You input a user and it searches all of the other 87 users by multiplying their rating of the book and adding them all together.

Basically books that the closest similarity score user read and rated high but the inputted user hasn't read. Okay now after that huge wall of text which I'm sorry about.

We think it has something to do with the if statement and the not equals comparison, but we've tried everything we can think of and can't get it to work properly.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks.</p>\n\n<p>Code snippet below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    if (cmd.equals(\"pay\") &amp;&amp; p.length == 3)\n    { // first word is \"pay\";three terms (cmd, sin, $)\n        System.out.println(\"pay\");\n        // Pay: decreases student payment, notifies of overpayment\n        String stuSin = p[1];\n        double stupay = Double.parseDouble(p[2]);\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; student.length; i++)\n        {\n            Student x1 = student[i];\n            String curSin = x1.getSin();\n            if (curSin.equals(stuSin))\n            {\n                double curpay = x1.getBal();\n                double newBal = curpay - stupay;\n                if (stupay &gt; curpay)\n                {\n                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Overpayment\");\n                    System.exit(0);\n                }\n                x1.setBal(newBal);\n                System.out.println(x1.getBal());\n\n                write(student, inrec);\n            }\n            else if (!curSin.equals(stuSin))\n            {\n                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"SIN not found\"); // sin not found\n                System.exit(0);\n            }\n\n        }// end of for loop\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["python","homework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":125,"score":-1,"question_id":10112339,"title":"How to check for a language of balanced delimiters","body":"<p>I would like to detect a delimiter in a string using Python.

Any help?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public struct cellDetail\n{\n    public int curGenStatus;\n    public int nextGenStatus;\n    public int age;\n\n}\npublic class Class1\n{\n\n    static cellDetail[,] Generations(cellDetail[,] cells)\n    {\n\n        int neighbours = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 40; i++)\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 60; j++)\n                cells[i, j].nextGenStatus = 0;\n\n        for (int row = 0; row &lt; 39; row++)\n            for (int col = 0; col &lt; 59; col++)\n            {\n                neighbours = 0;\n\n                if (row &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; col &gt; 0)\n                {\n                    if (cells[row - 1, col - 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n                    if (cells[row - 1, col].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n                    if (cells[row - 1, col + 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n\n                    if (cells[row, col - 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n                    if (cells[row, col + 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n\n                    if (cells[row + 1, col - 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                        neighbours++;\n                }\n\n                if (cells[row + 1, col].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                    neighbours++;\n                if (cells[row + 1, col + 1].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                    neighbours++;\n\n                if (neighbours &lt; 2)\n                    cells[row, col].nextGenStatus = 0;\n                if (neighbours &gt; 3)\n                    cells[row, col].nextGenStatus = 0;\n                if ((neighbours == 2 || neighbours == 3) &amp;&amp; cells[row, col].curGenStatus &gt; 0)\n                    cells[row, col].nextGenStatus = 1;\n                if (neighbours == 3 &amp;&amp; cells[row, col].curGenStatus == 0)\n                    cells[row, col].nextGenStatus = 1;\n            }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 40; i++)\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 60; j++)\n                cells[i, j].curGenStatus = cells[i, j].nextGenStatus;\n\n        return cells;\n    }\n\n    static void PrintCells(cellDetail[,] cells)\n    {\n        for (int row = 0; row &lt; 40; row++)\n        {\n            for (int col = 0; col &lt; 60; col++)\n            {\n                if (cells[row, col].curGenStatus != 0)\n                {\n                    cells[row, col].curGenStatus = (char)30;\n                    Console.Write((char)cells[row, col].curGenStatus);\n                }\n                else\n                    Console.Write(\" \");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void Random(int numOfGenerations)\n    {\n        cellDetail[,] cells = new cellDetail[40,60];\n        Random rand = new Random();\n\n        for (int row = 0; row &lt; 40; row++)\n            for (int col = 0; col &lt; 60; col++)\n                cells[row, col].curGenStatus = rand.Next(0, 2);\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfGenerations; i++)\n        {\n            Console.ForegroundColor = (ConsoleColor.Green);\n            Generations(cells);\n            Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 3);\n            PrintCells(cells);\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","homework","debugging"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":81,"score":0,"question_id":10086170,"title":"Add a private reference to a object","body":"<p>For my assignment, I need to add a private reference to a Unit object (_Unit).

I just can't figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it gives a complete answer for the starting value, but then removes a sublist each time until I'm left with only the last set of pairs.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. genList(0,48,48,Q). gives me:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[48,49,97,2352],[48,50,98,2400],[48,51,99,2448],[48,52,100,2496]]\n[[48,49,97,2352],[48,50,98,2400],[48,51,99,2448],[48,52,100,2496],[49,50,99,2450],[49,51,100,2499]]\n[[48,49,97,2352],[48,50,98,2400],[48,51,99,2448],[49,50,99,2450],[49,51,100,2499]]\n[[48,49,97,2352],[48,50,98,2400],[49,50,99,2450],[49,51,100,2499]]\n[[48,49,97,2352],[49,50,99,2450],[49,51,100,2499]]\n[[49,50,99,2450],[49,51,100,2499]]\nfalse.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, a sublist gets removed each time, I just can't see why!</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","homework","oracle-apex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":160,"score":0,"question_id":10091657,"title":"Gather inserted text values from multiple rows in a report","body":"<p>I'm currently struggling with Oracle Apex.\nI'm trying to create an application which enables customers to place their order.

Process Pi is then awakened by signaling B[i] and SCHED goes back to sleep by blocking on semaphore S.</li>\n<li>When a process Pi leaves the critical section, it signals S.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;\n\npublic class Process extends Thread {\n    static boolean V[];\n    int i;\n    static Semaphore B[]; //blocking semaphore\n    static Semaphore S;\n    private static int id;\n    static int N;\n    static int insist = 0;\n\n    public static void process (int i, int n) {\n       id = i;\n       N = n;\n       V = new boolean[N];\n    }\n\n    private void delay () {\n       try {\n        sleep (random(500));\n        }\n        catch (InterruptedException p) {\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static int random(int n) {\n        return (int) Math.round(n * Math.random() - 0.5);\n    }\n\n    private void entryprotocol(int i) {\n         V[Process.id] = true;\n         int turn = N;\n         while (V[Process.id] == true &amp;&amp; turn == N) {\n           System.out.println(\"P\" + Process.id + \" is requesting critical section\");\n           signal(S);\n         }\n        critical(Process.id);\n        wait(B[Process.id]);\n        V[Process.id] = false;\n        }\n\n\n\n   private void wait(Semaphore S) {\n       if (Process.id &gt; 0) {\n        Process.id--;\n      } else {\n        //add Process.id to id.queue and block\n        wait(B[Process.id]);\n       }\n   }\n\n     private void signal(Semaphore S) {\n         if (B[Process.id] != null) {\n          Sched(Process.id);\n        } else {\n          Process.id++; //remove process from queue\n          critical(Process.id); //wakes up current process\n         }\n     }\n\n    private void critical(int i) {\n        System.out.println(\"P\" + Process.id + \" is in the critical section\");\n        delay();\n        exitprotocol(i);\n     }\n\n    private void exitprotocol(int i) {\n        System.out.println(\"P\" + Process.id + \" is leaving the critical section\");\n        V[id] = false;\n        signal(S);\n    }\n\n     public void Sched(int i) {\n         if (B[Process.id] == null) {\n        signal(B[Process.id]);\n        }\n        wait(S);\n     }\n\n     public void run() {\n         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n            Sched(i);\n           entryprotocol(Process.id);\n           try {\n              wait(Process.id);\n          }\n           catch (InterruptedException p) {\n            }\n          signal(S);\n        }\n         }\n\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) {\n        int N = 5;\n\n        Process p[] = new Process[N];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\n        p[i] = new Process();\n        p[i].start();\n        }\n        }\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I believe my logic here is correct but I'm getting a lot of errors (such as Exception in thread \"Thread-1\" java.lang.NullPointerException).
