But what about negative weighted cycle?</p>\n\n<p>Qd) If G has a cycle with a unique lightest edge e, then e must be part of every MST.</p>\n\n<p>My answer is true.\nWe have to access all nodes in an MST. In a cycle of length 3, for instance, we can always traverse all nodes in that cycle with 2 steps.

As noted above, these text fields are not user editable. \nIn order to develop a robust multi-threaded GUI application in Java, programmer \nhas to ensure that all GUI parameters (i.e., properties of GUI Swing \ncomponents) are actually updated from only one thread: usually the Event \nDispatcher thread. </p>\n\n<p>In order to get some concrete ideas about it, read <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/threads/threads1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Threads and Swing</a></p>\n\n<p>As a result, threads that you create should not have access to any Swing \ncomponents. Rather maintain a data structure that is exposed to and update by \nthreads according to their cycle of execution. On the other hand, periodically \ninvoke repaint() methods from main thread to invite Swing Event Dispatcher \nthread to eventually visit the content of the data structure and display the \nGUI components accordingly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far I have an empty shell of a GUI that does everything mentioned above \nexcept for the actual changing of the button colors.

Let's say for the sake of argument that the system we are working on has an unsigned integer type size of 32 bits.  Let's further say that we have the number 29 stored in an unsigned integer variable.  In memory the number will have 27 zeros ahead of it.

I did not think of this earlier, but if a number like 8 (1000) is used then mayhem.  There is only one set bit in 8, so the shift is most certainly going to be wrong.

My problem is, I have exactly no idea how to do that. </p>\n\n<p>For those who wants to know how my registration page looks like, here it is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;html&gt;\n\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Registration&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"CSS_LABs.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;body&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;form id=\"Registration\" action=\"\" method=\"get\"&gt;\n\n    Username:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"usrname\" maxlength=\"10\"/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\n    Password:&lt;input type=\"password\" name=\"pswd\" maxlength=\"20\"/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    PersonID:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"PID\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    First Name:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"fname\"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n    Last Name:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"lname\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    DOB:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"dob\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Gender:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"sex\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Title:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"title\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n    Secret Question:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;select name=\"secret?\"&gt;\n    &lt;/select&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    Answer:&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"answer\" /&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By the way, I know certain information on my HTML document may not be worded properly, so do hope you guys don't mind. Also, I would also have to fix up my XML later by putting the answer to the secret question within  later. </p>\n\n<p>Alright, thanks a lot in advance guys.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE!!!</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Here we go, I finally figured out how to create an XML document with Javascript, here's the code:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>    var xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLDOM\");\n    var fso = new ActiveXObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\");\n    var FILENAME = 'G:\\\\CST2309 - Web Programming 1\\\\Copy of Take Home Exam - Copy\\\\PersonXML2.xml';\n\n    function SaveXML(UserData) \n    {   \n        var file = fso.CreateTextFile(FILENAME, true);\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\\n');\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;PersonInfo&gt;\\n');\n\n        for (countr = 0; countr &lt; UserData.length; countr++) {\n            file.Write('    &lt;Person ');\n            file.Write('Usrname=\"' + UserData[countr][0] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Pswd=\"' + UserData[countr][1] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('PersonID=\"' + UserData[countr][2] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('FirstName=\"' + UserData[countr][3] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('LastName=\"' + UserData[countr][4] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Gender=\"' + UserData[countr][5] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('DOB=\"' + UserData[countr][6] + '\" ');\n            file.Write('Title=\"' + UserData[countr][7] + '\"');\n            file.WriteLine('&gt;&lt;/Person&gt;\\n');\n        } // end for countr\n\n        file.WriteLine('&lt;/PersonInfo&gt;\\n');\n        file.Close();\n\n    } // end SaveXML function --------------------\n\n    function LoadXML(xmlFile) \n    {\n        xmlDoc.load(xmlFile);\n        return xmlDoc.documentElement;\n    } //end function LoadXML()\n\n    function initialize_array() \n    {\n        var person = new Array();\n        var noFile = true;\n        var xmlObj;\n        if (fso.FileExists(FILENAME)) \n        {\n            xmlObj = LoadXML(FILENAME);\n            noFile = false;\n            } // if\n        else \n        {\n            xmlObj = LoadXML(\"PersonXML.xml\");\n            //alert(\"local\" + xmlObj);\n            } // end if\n\n        var usrCount = 0;\n        while (usrCount &lt; xmlObj.childNodes.length) \n        {\n            var tmpUsrs = new Array(xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Usrname\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Pswd\"),\n                        xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"PersonID\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"FirstName\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"LastName\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Gender\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"DOB\"),\n                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute(\"Title\"));\n            person.push(tmpUsrs);\n            usrCount++;\n             }   //end while\n        if (noFile == false)\n            fso.DeleteFile(FILENAME);\n        SaveXML(person);\n    }   // end function initialize_array()  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this code here is doing is that, it takes my original XML file and loads it up into an array so it can create a new XML file. Basically I got the creating the XML file part down, but still need help with the rest of my stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>My goal is trying to take my form data and push it into my existing array, not overwrite it, add to it, so I can update my existing XML file with the new registration information. This is where I have absolutely no idea how to do.

For this particular assignment, we are to do the classic 'Cards in a Deck' program. We are to make two classes, one called 'Card' and the other 'Deck'. Now I've gotten a large chunk of this done so far but a concept seems to be escaping me.</p>\n\n<p>When we call a default constructor for the Card class, all 52 cards are to be created so that the Deck class may use these objects and... well create a deck! Now I attended a session with our TA and he stressed the fact that the default constructor is to initialize the values while the Deck class takes these objects and loops through them to use a function that assigns real card values to the Card objects. </p>\n\n<p>My question is this: what is the best approach for creating these objects so that Deck may reference them? My idea right now is to create a fixed array called 'initialCard[4][13]'. From there, the Deck class will pick a value - say 'initialCard[0][0]' and assign it to an Ace of Spades solely from the row and column of the two-dimensional array. However, my TA keep saying 'create an array of Card objects'. What could he mean by that? I have a slight grasp but I'm just unsure... anyone have any ideas? Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this will help... straight from the assignment page:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Your card class should have public getter and setter functions for both of these variables (getValue,\nsetValue, etc), as well as a function that will return a c-string representation of the card. (You can\ncall it toCString if you want.) It should work something as follows:</p>\n\n<p>void toCString(char cardString[])\nINPUT: A character array for storing the output\nOUTPUT: NONE\nThis function should return a character string representing the card object. This string\nmust have the following form: two characters followed by a third null byte. The first character\nrepresents suit; the second represents value. Suits should be “S”, “H”, “C”, or “D” for spades, hearts,</p>\n\n<p>clubs, diamonds. The second character represents value: “A” for Ace, 2-9 for numbered cards, “T” for\n10, “J” for Jack, “Q” for Queen”, “K” for King. Some examples:\n2 of spades = 'S2'\n10 of hearts = 'HT'\nJack of diamonds = 'DJ'\nQueen of clubs = 'CQ'\nAce of spades = 'SA'\netc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In addition to these, you should have at least a default constructor to initialize the values.</strong> You are\nwelcome to create other constructors (perhaps one that initializes a card from it's c-string\nrepresentation?) but it is not required.</p>\n\n<p>Deck Class:\nIn addition to your card class, you will need to create a Deck class to encapsulate all of your card\nobjects. In this object you should have a private member multi-dimensional array (of size SUITS by\nVALUES) of your Card objects. When a Deck object is created, you should have it initialize the multi-\ndimensional array of Cards. Card suits are represented by an enumerated type; card values are\nrepresented by an integer from 1 to 13 (1 is an Ace, 2-10 are numbered values, 11 is the Jack, 12 is the\nQueen, and 13 is the King).</p>\n\n<p>Your constructor should loop over the multi-dimensional array and initialize all values so that the\ncomplete deck of cards is represented.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So maybe you can see why I am confused... I swear I understand these concepts but argh... this is killing me. After this, the rest of the project should be cake I'm confident...</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","homework","phonegap","phonegap-plugins"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2202,"score":0,"question_id":8880814,"title":"How to install phonegap Facebook plugin for iPhone","body":"<p>i'm making a project for school and I want to use the phone gap Facebook plugin for iOS, but the installation instructions in the text file is rather complicated.

One possible way of solving this\n  problem is exhaustive search, or the brute-force approach. In this\n  approach, we test all possible answers, and compare those that are\n  correct solutions to the given problem, in order to find the optimal\n  answer.</p>\n  \n  <p>In particular, for the problem of marking change, given a cash\n  amount in cents, we can first find out for any way of making change\n  correctly (NOT necessarily using as few coins as possible), the\n  maximum numbers of toonies, loonies, etc. that we can use. We can then\n  perform a six-level loop to iterate through all possibles combinations\n  of coins, using the maximum numbers computed before as the upper bound\n  for the corre- sponding coins in any solution. More precisely, in the\n  outermost loop, we iterator the solutions that use 1 toonie, 2\n  toonies, ..., the maximum number of toonies computed. In the second\n  outermost loop, we iterate the solutions that use 1 loonie, 2 loonies,\n  ..., the maximum number of loonies computed (the number of toonies in\n  these solutions is determined in the outermost loop), and so on. In\n  the innermost loop, for each solution, we check whether it is a\n  correct solution for the given cash amount. If it is, then we check\n  whether it uses fewer coins than all the correct solutions that we\n  have seen so far. </p>\n  \n  <p>For example, if the cash amount is 200, then we can\n  use at most 1 toonie, 2 loonies, 8 quarters, 20 dimes, 40 nickels and\n  200 pennies in any solution. We then check the following solutions\n  (each solution contains 6 numbers that are the numbers of coins of\n  eachtypeused,startingfromtoonies):\n  0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,1;0,0,0,0,0,2; ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 200; 0, 0, 0,\n  0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,\n  200; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1; .... In this particular\n  example, any solution that we test should use no more than 1 toonie, 2\n  loonies, 8 quarters, 20 dimes, 40 nickels and 200 pennies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What's it mean by this brute-forceness?

What I was asked to implement is a menu option that allows a user to share a sheet (i.e. the user selects 'share a sheet' - it's the current one - and then selects the area that they wish to share: A1:A9, for example). Then they can specify a local port and the share is created.</p>\n\n<p>The other users who wish to connect to that share will have to know the machine's IP and the port to connect. Once they input that info under a menu option called 'join a shared sheet' then that shared area will appear in their current sheet, and they are free to edit and view what others are typing in those cells.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has read/write access - that must be controlled by threads (because we can have 1 person sharing and 3 peers connected to that sheet, all viewing the changes and making their own). Multiple exclusion will have to be guaranteed (this can be done with Semaphores and/or Reentrantlocks).</p>\n\n<p>The sharing implementation has to implemented in a peer to peer architecture. </p>\n\n<p>Now my question is: how to I start developing with sockets in Java?

This is the easiest way I've come to see it:</p>\n\n<p>The lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 0\n2 0\n2 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>equal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            AlphabetSymbol0        AlphabetSymbol1\nState0         State1                State0\nState1         State2                State0\nState2         State2                State0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then there's a line that says which are the final states for the automaton.</p>\n\n<p>Then comes a line which says which is the initial state and how many input strings will come.</p>\n\n<p>Then come the lines with the input strings.</p>\n\n<p>The output of this program should be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Case #1:\naccept 2\nreject 0\nreject 1\nCase #2:\naccept 2\nreject 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It should say if the String is accepted or rejected and on which state it ended.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I've only coded the work with the input. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I don't know how would be most convenient to represent the automaton.</strong> Should I create a Graph class? Should I simply use arrays? What logic would I apply to the arrays?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT THIS IS THE CODE I'VE PRODUCED FOLLOWING MICHAEL BORGWARDT'S ADVICE. \n    THE TRANSITIONS WORK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THE STRING GETS STUCK ON STATE 0 WHEN BEING PROCESSED.</strong>\n  ** </p>\n\n<pre><code>  /*\n * To change this template, choose Tools | Templates\n * and open the template in the editor.\n */\n\npackage afd;\n\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\n/**\n *\n * @author Administrator\n */\npublic class Main {\n\n    /**\n     * @param args the command line arguments\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        // TODO code application logic here\n\n        FileReader fr = new FileReader(\"E://Documents and Settings//Administrator//My Documents//NetBeansProjects//AFD//src//afd//dfa.in\");\n\n\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\n\n        String firstLine= br.readLine();\n\n\n        String [] firstLineSplitted = firstLine.split(\" \");\n\n        /*debug*/\n        System.out.println(\"firstLine is \" + firstLine);\n\n        int numberOfTestCases = Integer.parseInt(firstLine);\n\n        for (int indexOfTestCases =0;

Here is my code so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n//#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n//Global variables\nint position=0; //to set the player position\nfloat rate = 1.0; //the rate of playback\n\nvoid LoadFile(const char *fileName, char *text){\n    FILE *ifp; //a file pointer for file read/write\n    //char *mode = \"r\"; // mode 'r' means reading\n    //char lineOfText[50];\n\n    //opening the file\n    ifp = fopen(fileName, \"r\");\n    if(ifp == NULL){\n            fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open input file \\\"%s\\\"!\\n\",fileName);\n            exit(1);\n    }\n    else{\n            //printf(\"This is the text: \");\n            fgets(text,50,ifp); //getting the text from the file\n            //printf(\"%s\", text);\n    }\n    //closing the file  \n    fclose(ifp); \n}\n\nvoid *Start();\nvoid *Stop();\nvoid Rewind();\nvoid SeekTo(int byteOffset);\nvoid setRate(float rate);\n\nint main(void){\n\n    //pthread_t playerThread;\n    //  string test;\n\n    int i = 0;\n    char choice;\n    char fileName[25];\n    char lineOfText[50];    //holds the text inside the file\n    printf(\"Please enter the file you want to open: \");\n    scanf(\"%s\", fileName);\n    LoadFile(fileName,lineOfText);\n    printf(\"%s\",lineOfText);   //I will display the whole string\n    //printf(\"%s\",lineOfText[0]); // I get an error with this\n    /*printf(\"What would you like to do?\\n\");\n    printf(\"p--play\\n\");\n    printf(\"r--rewind\\n\");\n    printf(\"s--stop\\n\");\n    printf(\"f--seek\\n\");*/\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can anyone help me please?

I tried, and nothing I've found has helped.</p>\n\n<p>The code I have so far is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DateUtil {\n\n    public static GregorianCalendar convertFromDMY(String dd_mm_yy) throws ParseException{\n\n        // this actually works, got rid of the original code idea\n        String[] splitDate = dd_mm_yy.split(\"-\");\n        int days = Integer.parseInt(splitDate[0]);\n        int month = Integer.parseInt(splitDate[1]);\n        int year = Integer.parseInt(splitDate[2]);\n\n        // dates are going in right, checked in print statement,\n        // but the object is not getting formatted...\n        GregorianCalendar dateConverted = new GregorianCalendar(year, month, days);\n        format(dateConverted);\n        return dateConverted;\n    }\n\n    public static String format(GregorianCalendar date){\n\n        SimpleDateFormat fmt = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MMM-yyyy\");\n        String dateFormatted = fmt.format(date);\n        return dateFormatted;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The error I get is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot format given Object >as a Date</p>\n  \n  <p>at java.text.DateFormat.format(DateFormat.java:281)\n    at java.text.Format.format(Format.java:140)\n    at lab2.DateUtil.format(DateUtil.java:26)\n    at lab2.DateUtil.convertFromDMY(DateUtil.java:19)\n    at lab2.Lab2.createStudent(Lab2.java:75)\n    at lab2.Lab2.main(Lab2.java:34)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And another thing, am I even using the GregorianCalendar right??

First, convert the birthdate to a GregorianCalendar and store it in the person object. Then in the print statement just simply tell the program to format that date as it's being printed. Problem was solved. All works according to specifications now, and I feel that much stupider because I was flailing like a fish out of water for the last day or so with the DateUtil class, trying to get them to work at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help all on getting the date go in properly!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","homework"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":0,"question_id":10333190,"title":"How to input and exception","body":"<p>Ok here is a code I am working on.

Default position for the cube is left upper angle of the board, blue side up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>B B . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(4x4 example, B stands for blue)</p>\n\n<p><strong>There could be stones (obstacles) on the blackboard.</strong>\nMoves I can make with my figure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>rotating it for 90/180/270 degrees clockwise</li>\n<li>you can flip the cube around its right/left/upper/lower edge, changing its ''upward color''</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For an example, using flip right on the default position:</p>\n\n<pre><code>. .

I recall being told that I may need another vector/array that keeps track of squares that I've already visited/checked, but then how would I implement that here exactly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","performance","homework","sorting"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":137,"score":0,"question_id":10767729,"title":"Array sorting effective","body":"<p>i need to write method who can sort array, the sort method should be efficient as possible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning of the array will appear all the numbers that divide by 4 without remainder.</li>\n<li>Will be followed by all the numbers that divide by 4 with remainder of 1</li>\n<li>Will be followed by all the numbers that divide by 4 with remainder of 2</li>\n<li>At the end of the array will all the other numbers (those that divide by four with the remaining three).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I tried this set 4 pointers:\n2 pointers At first the remainder of 0 and 1\n2 pointers at the last of the array for the remainder of 2 and 3</p>\n\n<p>this is what i could find so far (with problem of course), I appreciate your help !</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void sortByFour (int[] arr)\n{\n    int temp;\n    int noRemainderIndex = 0;\n    int remainder1Index = 1;\n    int remainder2Index = arr.length - 2;\n    int remainder3Index = arr.length - 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)\n    {\n        if (arr[i] % 4 == 0)\n        {\n            temp = arr[noRemainderIndex];\n            arr[noRemainderIndex] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            noRemainderIndex++;\n            remainder1Index++;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 1)\n        {\n            temp = arr[remainder1Index];\n            arr[remainder1Index] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder1Index++;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 2)\n        {\n            temp = arr[remainder2Index];\n            arr[remainder2Index] = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder2Index--;\n        }\n        else if (arr[i] % 4 == 3)\n        {   \n            temp = arr[remainder3Index];\n            arr[remainder3Index] = temp = arr[i];\n            arr[i] = temp;\n            remainder3Index--;\n            remainder2Index--;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","2d-array"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":1,"question_id":10747164,"title":"The Real Size of an 2D Array, (Filled area of 2D array), in Java","body":"<p>I'm having problem with my homework assignment, and hoping to find some help.</p>\n\n<p>I have to read a text file into a 2D int array. \nThe width of the 2D array is fixed at 5 and will never change.

I've got most of them going pretty fast, except for these two, which bugs me so much because they are VERY simply functions. One basically sets all values in a two dimensional array to the same value and one basically swaps the values of two 2-D arrays. And that's the problem. They're taking up the most time but because they're so simple, I can't figure out how to reduce them without breaking the functions. And I know it's possible to make them run faster, because other students in the class have been getting ridiculous speed ups. The two in question are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fSetArray(int rows, int cols, float val)\n{\n    int i, j;\n    F2D *out;\n    out = fMallocHandle(rows, cols);\n\n    for(i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)\n    for(j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)\n        subsref(out,i,j) = val;\n\n    return out;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only important part is the two loops there. Basically, we have a 2-D array with a certain width (rows) and a certain height (cols) and we're setting ALL of the values to val. But there's no way that I can see to eliminate one of the loops (which would be the best way to speed it up). Unless I'm missing something obvious. If cols and rows were the same number, this would be so much easier.</p>\n\n<p>The other function is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fDeepCopy(F2D* in)\n{\n    int i, j;\n    F2D* out;\n    int rows, cols;\n\n    rows = in-&gt;height;\n    cols = in-&gt;width;\n\n    out = fMallocHandle(rows, cols);\n\n    for(i=0; i&lt;rows; i++)\n    for(j=0; j&lt;cols; j++)\n        subsref(out,i,j) = subsref(in,i,j);\n\n    return out;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The out array is always larger than the in array, so we don't have to worry about overflow or such. This function basically just swaps the values of the two arrays, but once again, because it's so simple, I can't quite get it to reduce any further.</p>\n\n<p>And before anyone says parallelization, because of the sample size and server, the overhead required to create the threads actually slows down the program. I've tried. Because these two functions are too short, it's not worth creating the threads only to kill them after one parallel for. </p>\n\n<p>But for reference, yes technically this is an OpenMP project and we're supposed to use parallelization, but for these two functions, doing so actually slows down the whole program. I've timed it with a parallel for loop to check.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks for everyone who gave me ideas!

For example the CarlH lectures lost me at around unit 5 part 1 and 2 where it jumped the shark and neglected to say how to run, compile, execute code. I got confused and decided to try something else. I tried Invent your own computer games with python though it lost me at around the hangman chapter. I have also tried other things, though there is always that point where it goes \"Here, it is easy! Try this...!\" and of course it is something that in no way I understand.

Here is part of the specs - </p>\n\n<p><em>\"You'll have to do a little thinking to figure out how to get the printed names lined up with all the other columns. The first hint is that it involves joining strings together, something called concatenation. Give it a go, and if you can't figure it out, look at the next document in this folder; it contains additional hints. Part of the purpose of this assignment is to implicitly teach you concatenation. Do NOT use tabs (\\t) and make sure your C/C++ editor does not produce tab characters.\nDo NOT use gets() in this program. Use scanf() for inputting the interactive information. If you try to use gets(), you may get VERY frustrated.\nIn essence, all numbers appearing in the report should be right-justified and decimal-aligned. All numbers appearing in the summary should appear without leading spaces (other than the one which normally separates the number from the previous word). Hourly wage amounts CAN be less than 10.00, so be very careful with your formatting. The sample output can appear correct, but you can still be docked a half-point if things don't align properly with hourly wages under $10.00.\"\nAdditional hints:\n\"You may assume that the employee name is always two names, a first name and a last name separated by a space. Also assume that there are never any spaces within a first name or within a last name. This allows you to use two scanf() calls instead of one gets() call. gets() would introduce some oddities that make things not work correctly later down the line. \nYou may also assume that neither name exceeds 10 characters in length. \nThe input from the Process another employee? question should be a single character. Assume that N or n will stop the loop, but that any other character will continue the loop.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Anyone know how to do this?

Basically we need to write an abstract base class from which other (non abstract) classes inherit, the header file of the abstract base class looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//AbstractBase.h \nclass AbstractBase\n{\n    public:\n        AbstractBase();\n        virtual int operator+ (int)=0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have no idea what to put in the implementation .cpp file since it's an abstract class (so you can't create any objects from that class, I'm probably very very wrong here) so I just didn't make one.</p>\n\n<p>Then there's the derived class with a header file and implementation as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Headerfile for DerivedClass\n#include \"AbstractBase.h\"\nclass DerivedClass: public AbstractBase\n{\n    public:\n        DerivedClass(double &amp;);\n        DerivedClass * operator+ (DerivedClass*);\n        double getVar();\n        void setVar(double)\n    private:\n        double Var;\n}\n\n//Implementation of DerivedClass\n#include \"DerivedClass.h\"\nclass DerivedClass::DerivedClass(double &amp;Input) :Var(Input)\n{}\n\ndouble DerivedClass::getVar()\n{\n    return Var;\n}\n\nvoid DerivedClass::setVar(double Input)\n{\n    Var=Input;\n}\n\nDerivedClass * DerivedClass::operator+ (DerivedClass * object)\n{\n    double Sum;\n    Sum=Var+object-&gt;getVar()\n    DerivedClass result(Sum);\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my question comes down to this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the overloading part (last lines) should do the following: when I add\ntwo object of the class DerivedClass, it should just add the private\nvariables (double Var) together. I've done some searching but\ncouldn't immediately find something that I could use (perhaps because\nof my limited knowledge on this matter).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A small side question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>what do I do with the AbstractBase class? My task description states\nthat it should only contain 4 virtual functions that are all\noverloading an operator. But it's an abstract base class and I don't\nknow yet HOW I would overload them (i.e. it's like saying \"add two\nthings, I have no idea how but I know you can add em up...\", that's\nall the abstract class says)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Edit: some clarification on how I think it should happen.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract base class contains a virtual function operator+. In the derived class, I define a new operator+ which knows how to handle the addition of objects of the derived class. If I use a pointer of the type DerivedClass* it will ignore the virtual function and go for the operator+ function defined in the DerivedClass (the basic principle of virtual functions?). The problem seems that the derived class is still seen as an abstract class, so I can't use the code provided by Component 10, because that instantiates an object of DerivedClass (which isn't possible because apparently it's abstract)</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: </p>\n\n<p>Our professor decided to leave out the operator overloading because it involved too complex code :D Thanks for the help anyway, I did learn how to correctly implement it (sort of).</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","homework","swing","combobox","awt"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":138,"score":1,"question_id":10474836,"title":"More on ComboBox","body":"<p>I have a final coming up and one of the points my professor stressed was ComboBoxes.
