Right now I would like to do the same using ranges (ie i specify the range in time.. read a small chunk of audio as per the time, and then go back and read again). The reason why I want to use time range is b/c I want to control the size of each read (to fit in a packet with a max size). </p>\n\n<p>for some reason, there is always a bump between each read. In my code you'll notice that I start the AVAssetReader and end it every time I set a time range, and that's b/c I cannot dynamically adjust the time range after the reader has started (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5508619/how-to-seek-within-an-audio-track-using-avassetreader\">here</a> for more details).</p>\n\n<p>Could it be that starting and ending a reader is just too expensive to produce a continues real time experience? Or are other ways of doing this that I'm not aware of? </p>\n\n<p>Also note that this jitter or lag happens at whatever I set the time interval to be.. which makes me believe that starting and ending a reader the way I am is too expensive for real time audio playback.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) setupReader \n{\n    NSURL *assetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"ipod-library://item/item.m4a?id=1053020204400037178\"];

To this end, I put shared code in a static library project, referenced by the new derivative apps. </p>\n\n<p>Now this static library should contain a set of Core Data related files, that are used by all white-labeled projects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A managed object model, compiled into a <code>model.mom</code></li>\n<li>A read-only sqlite store, generated earlier as sqlite-store.db</li>\n<li>A set of NSManagedObject subclasses, generated by <a href=\"http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mogenerator</a> based on the <code>model.xcdatamodel(d)</code> package/file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Custom Bundle</h3>\n\n<p>Static libraries can't contain anything but compiled code, so in order to pass around the .mom and .db files, I add a new bundle target (following <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711586/core-data-in-a-static-library-for-the-iphone\">examples here on stackoverflow</a> and from other online resources like <a href=\"http://www.galloway.me.uk/tutorials/ios-library-with-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matt Galloway</a> and <a href=\"http://nachbaur.com/blog/smarter-core-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Nachbauer</a>). This bundle target compiles the model.xcdatamodel(d) into the model.mom file and copies the sqlite-store.db. This works and I have access to the bundle when running the main app.</p>\n\n<h3>Problem</h3>\n\n<p>The Mogenerator classes contain some extra methods needed to use the data, compiled into the static library. One example class would be <code>CDNode</code> extending <code>_CDNode</code> extending <code>NSManagedObject</code> and the custom method I added is <code>-(CGRect)frame</code>. Xcode is fine with these files, shown by correctly autocompleting the <code>frame</code> method and compiling without any warnings.</p>\n\n<p>However when the <code>frame</code> method is called on a <code>CDNode</code> instance called <code>node</code>, LLDB throws an exception with the following description:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-[NSManagedObject frame]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xea8ef50\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When running <code>po node</code> in the console, the printout looks fine. The object <strong>is</strong> a CDNode instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(CDNode *) $1 = 0x0ea8ef50 &lt;NSManagedObject: 0xea8ef50&gt; (entity: CDNode; id: 0xea630c0 &lt;x-coredata://C5ECBF02-768D-4961-9E03-C62A9850964B/ZPSpace/p2358&gt; ; data: &lt;fault&gt;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This output had me doubting \"isn't this a CDNode class then?\", but the <code>(CDNode *)</code> at the start is an artefact of it's variable type, not the actual object's class. Running <code>po [node class]</code> shows it is in fact just a 'plain' NSManagedObject:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(id) $2 = 0x0ea8ef50 NSManagedObject\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Suspect</h3>\n\n<p>I think the compiler can't find the class (header) files when compiling the .xcdatamodel(d) to the .mom(d). If I add the mogenerator classes and the <code>model.xcdatamodeld</code> package to the top level project directly, taking the static library out of the equation, the app runs fine and passes the <code>frame</code>-call. </p>\n\n<h3>Question</h3>\n\n<p>How do I get the xcdatamodeld to accept the classes that belong to it?</p>\n\n<p><em>Alternative solutions are much appreciated too!</em></p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","image-processing","opencv","perspective"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":4,"question_id":13269432,"title":"Perspective Transform + Crop in iOS with OpenCV","body":"<p>I'm trying to implement a cropping &amp;  perspective correction feature into an upcoming app. Whilst doing research, I came across:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7838487/executing-cvwarpperspective-for-a-fake-deskewing-on-a-set-of-cvpoint\">Executing cv::warpPerspective for a fake deskewing on a set of cv::Point</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sudokugrab.blogspot.ch/2009/07/how-does-it-all-work.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sudokugrab.blogspot.ch/2009/07/how-does-it-all-work.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So I decided to try implementing this feature with OpenCV - the framework is there so the installation was fast.

Traditionally, we compiled the code we needed into a .dll and called that .dll when we needed a calculation done. We are now trying to create an iPad app, which unfortunately means we can't just call a .dll anymore. </p>\n\n<p>One of my coworkers have managed to make a simple Command Line Tool project, where we call a Fortran file to write \"Hello, World\" in the debugger.  However, when I try to get it to work on view based iPad app, I get a bunch of linker errors saying the symbols I'm using cannot be found.  I know that the Command Line Tool uses a .cpp file to actually run the Fortran, and I've seen many threads concerning calling .cpp files in an app, but all the ones I've seen are outdated, directly contradict each other, and their fixes don't work for me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a more direct way to call Fortran straight from a .m file?  If not, what do I have to do to take the working Command Line Tool and get it into an app?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 1: following the tutorials posted in the comments, I have been able to create a .o file from my Fortran code.  I can do a File-Add Files to add it in easily enough, but now how do I actually call it?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: Okay, baby steps.  I found out you can make a .a static library (I'll call it \"new_library\") from .o files (\"source_file.o\") using the Terminal command <code>ar crv new_library.a source_file.o</code> (you can do it for multiple .o files by just adding <code>source_file2.o source_file3.o</code> for as many .o files as you want - NOTE: make sure you use <code>cd</code> to get to the folder where the .o files are located).  I'm pretty sure Xcode will work with .a files, but it seems a .h file is still needed to let the other files in the project (like the view controllers) make calls to what's in the .a file. I know I can make a new .a file from Xcode itself (New Project -> iOS -> Framework &amp; Library -> Cocoa Touch Static Library), but when I've done it that way in the past, I just write normal .m and .h files, and when I build the new library it just mashes all the .m files into 1 .a.  When I want to use the code in that .a in another project, I just import the .a and all the .h files into the new project, and I can call the methods in the .a file just as if I had imported all the separate .m files.  So the next question is, do I still need a .h when my .a is made with the terminal instead of Xcode?  If so, how would I make a Fortran header file?  If not, how do I call my Fortran code in the .a?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","osx","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13274955,"title":"Changing reference to different object without changing initially referenced object?","body":"<p>I'm currently trying to write an XML-parser with the help of NSXMLParser.

I have to scroll more and I will be able to see it but it goes back up again to 3/4. Its kind of like the scroll to refresh, where the view only moves if you drag it and when you leave it bumps back to where it was. Why is this happening? Is it just that Apple designed <code>UICollectionView</code> so poorly? This is a little ridiculous...

However, the <code>NSObject</code> implementation of <code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> half works. It propogates changes from bindee to binder (i.e. from model/controller to view), but doesn't work the opposite way.

It is non-retaining to avoid the retain cycle problem.</p>\n\n<p>When -[NSWindowController release] is called and retainCount == 1, The NSAutounbinder unbinds all bindings to itself.

I have an extension method to <code>NSMutableArray</code> to move an item from one index to another.  It's a fairly simple method and it works flawlessly when I compile my app in Debug Configuration.  However, if I compile the app in Release Configuration, it crashes if I move from an item down (from index > to index).  The crash isn't a an index out of bounds error.  My local variable are being messed up and I have no idea why.

Sometimes it's set to <code>nil</code> but often it's some other random variable in my code.  If it's <code>nil</code> the code crashes when I try to replace the object in the array.

My code (in <code>viewDidLoad</code>) so far is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyAppDelegate *app = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];\nNSString *table = @\"MyData\";\nNSError *error;\nNSManagedObjectContext *context = [app managedObjectContext];\nNSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:table inManagedObjectContext:context];\nNSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"recordKey LIKE %@\", self.recordKey];\nNSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];\n[request setPredicate:predicate];\n[request setEntity:entity];\n\nNSArray *arr = [context executeFetchRequest:request error:&amp;error];\nif (arr.count == 0)\n{\n    // No entries exist for this recordKey, so use default values\n    predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"recordKey LIKE %@\", @\"DEFAULT\"];\n    [request setPredicate:predicate];\n    NSArray *defaultArr = [context executeFetchRequest:request error:&amp;error];\n    if (defaultArr.count == 1)\n    {\n        MyData *defaultData = [defaultArr objectAtIndex:0]; //create placeholder for for default data\n        currentData = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:table inManagedObjectContext:context]; //create a new row to correspond to this session\n        currentData = defaultData; //preload with default values\n        currentData.recordKey = self.recordKey; //set record key for this session to it's unique identifier\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"Error - DEFAULT record not found in table '%@', or multiple DEFAULT records found, in viewDidLoad on RunwayAnalysisController.m\",table);\n    }\n}\nelse if (arr.count == 1)\n{\n    // Record found for this recordKey, so set it as the current MyData object\n    currentData = [arr objectAtIndex:0];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when I leave my controller, I just</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (![context save:&amp;error])\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Error writing entry to %@ table in saveClick on RunwayAnalysisController.m\",table);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run this, my default records are being overwritten by any changes the user makes during this session.  I think the problem is <code>currentData = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:table inManagedObjectContext:context]; currentData = defaultData;</code> isn't doing what I want it to - create a new entry, load that entry with the information in the default record, then sever the tie with the default record and be on it's own to be filled as the user interacts with the controls on the page.  I'm probably misunderstanding what exactly one of these two lines is doing.  Does anyone see what I'm doing wrong here, and suggest how to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","osx","cocoa","file","file-in-use"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":170,"score":2,"question_id":8645831,"title":"Detect file in use by other process","body":"<p>On windows and such I used to use a trick to find out of a file is currently in use (written specifically). </p>\n\n<p>I use to open the file for writing and if it failed most likey another process is busy accessing it. </p>\n\n<p>Sadly these trick (using C OPEN with exclusive lock for writing) doesn't work on my Mac.

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","bookmarks","epub"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1181,"score":2,"question_id":9987038,"title":"iOS : How to implement a bookmark for ePub reader?","body":"<p>I'm create an ePub reader for iPad/iPhone</p>\n\n<p>The basic code is from <a href=\"https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader\" rel=\"nofollow\">AePubReader</a></p>\n\n<p>I add page curl effect,adjust image size ... but remove some function (ex.slider the page)</p>\n\n<p>But I still don't know how to implement bookmark function ...</p>\n\n<p>We have many <a href=\"https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader/issues/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion here</a>  , some people record the page number as bookmark index</p>\n\n<p>This is a solution , but not good enough , if you wanna add mark in page 100 .</p>\n\n<p>When you change the text size , you may not found the paragraph you want in p.100</p>\n\n<p>So , as I say in the issue discuss , I need to do few things ...</p>\n\n<p>1.Set &lt; p >  tag or id</p>\n\n<p>2.Get the &lt; p > in  every page </p>\n\n<p>3.Press the bookmark button means record the top &lt; P > in current page ,if the the top &lt; P > is from previous page , record the previous page's last &lt; P ></p>\n\n<p>4.Search the &lt; P > by tag ,  if match , show the page number .</p>\n\n<p>So ...

(e.g. Under \"Custom Objects\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've read the following, but I still can't get it to work (Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard) :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Adding Custom Objects to the Library</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Although you normally drag items out of the Library window and into\n  your user interface, you can also drag your custom configurations of\n  those objects back into the Library window. Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","uitableview","ios5","uitableviewcell"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13249658,"title":"UITableViewCell is not clickable","body":"<p>I have a custom UITableViewCell with lot of buttons, textfields, labels and a view.

It's been quite fun, but one problem I've been running in to is working with arbitrarily large numbers. I'm still pretty green on these things, so I don't know why something like, say, Python, handles large numbers with ease compared to Obj-C. </p>\n\n<p>Take for example <code>Problem 15</code>:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Starting in the top left corner of a 2 x 2 grid, there are 6 routes (without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.</code> </p>\n  \n  <p><code>How many routes are there through a 20 x 20 grid?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's easy.

The unmanaged object is left alone, and dealloc appears to be invoked at a reasonable time by the caller.  At this point the managed object is released and disposed.  This seems reasonable, but on the downside the base type's dealloc won't be run (I think?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Increases the retain count and saves a reference.  Unmanaged and managed objects leak forever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Extends Method 3 by adding a cleanup function that is run periodically (e.g. during Init of each new ImageAndTextCell object).  The cleanup function checks the retain counts of the stored objects.  A retain count of 1 means the caller has released it, so we should as well.  Should eliminate leaking in theory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 5:</strong> Attempt to invoke the copyWithZone method on the base type, and then construct a new ImageAndTextView object with the resulting handle.  Seems to do the right thing (the base data is cloned).  Internally, NSObject bumps the retain count on objects constructed like this, so we also use the PeriodicCleanup function to release these objects when they're no longer used.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, I believe Method 5 is the best approach since it should be the only one that results in a truly correct copy of the base type data, but I don't know if the approach is inherently dangerous (I am also making some assumptions about the underlying implementation of NSObject).  So far nothing bad has happened \"yet\", but if anyone is able to vet my analysis then I would be more confident going forward.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","error-handling","uiactivityviewcontroller"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13239684,"title":"Apple Mach-O Linker error (APActivityIcon)","body":"<p>I've a problem!

this is how I have moved it thus far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) draggedOut: (UIControl *) c withEvent: (UIEvent *) ev \n{\n\n if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait)\n {\n  c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view];\n  AddedText.center = c.center;\n }\n else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown)\n {\n  c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view];\n  AddedText.center = c.center;\n }\n else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft)\n {\n  c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view];\n  AddedText.center = c.center;\n }\n else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight)\n {\n  c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view];\n  AddedText.center = c.center;\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","md5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13243618,"title":"Encryption

Others working with Salesforce and REST have run into the same issue (ref <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/restkit/HJNjB7I6WVM/8u5n7nHoJQUJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/restkit/HJNjB7I6WVM/8u5n7nHoJQUJ</a>).  I created a class to wrap the calls to Salesforce and automatically follow these links, and process the returned data sets correctly.  The class instance registers itself as the delegate for the REST call.</p>\n\n<p>The class I wrote works great on its own (when there's a single instance), but I'll be creating other classes and have several instances that will need to handle their data independently.  I've read through the documentation and code (it's been a learning experience, I've only worked with ios for about a month now), but I can't see if it's guaranteed that a particular instance will respond as the delegate for its requests alone, or if it might accidentally pick up the responses for another instance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose I have instances A and B, both of which are making requests using RKObjectLoader, and which set themselves as delegates using <code>loader.delegate = self;</code>.  Both are running simultaneously (asynchronous).  Here's a potential flow I see:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A's RKObjectLoader makes call, registers self as delegate for response</li>\n<li>RestKit framework sends request for A</li>\n<li>B's RKObjectLoader makes call, registers self as delegate for response</li>\n<li>RestKit framework sends request for B</li>\n<li>... wait ...</li>\n<li>RestKit framework gets response, <strong>and somehow determines that this response was from B's request, calling B as the delegate</strong></li>\n<li>B delegate methods get called</li>\n<li>RestKit framework gets response, <strong>and somehow determines that this response was from A's request, calling A as the delegate</strong></li>\n<li>A delegate methods get called</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I couldn't see how the RestKit framework would distinguish between responses from requests, and thereby ensure that the correct delegate instances get called.  In other words, it appears to me that RestKit might get a response to a request, and then call any delegate it wants ... but that seems counterintuitive, and the framework author appears to be very sharp.</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If I have a class instance using RKObjectLoader and setting itself as the delegate, can I be guaranteed that it will be called when the response for that request comes in?</li>\n<li>Can you point me to the actual implementation in the RestKit framework that handles this, so I can learn how it's done?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks very much!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","connection","nsurlconnection","3g"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":1,"question_id":13239714,"title":"iOS - 3G slow connection issue when connecting to back-end API server","body":"<p>Currently I am working on an App which requires serveral calls to a back-end server.\nWhen on Wifi the App connects fine and downloads very fast the data, but when on 3G the connection seems a bit unstable and very slow.</p>\n\n<p>So I have done some very simple testcases (which you find below).

Below, I will list my issue, and the research I have put into it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The scenario:</strong> I was given a .csv file with 5000 rows and three columns. The three columns are defined as:</p>\n\n<p>Site ID|Site Name|Site URL</p>\n\n<p><strong>My task:</strong> To create an HTML interface for the designers of the company to rate each site on a scale of 1-5. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My plan of action:</strong> I am a new hire. I am getting accustomed to the language I was hired for, which was Objective-C. </p>\n\n<p>My algorithm for the project was to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Parse the .csv</li>\n<li>Remove the \"Site Name\" variable</li>\n<li>Create a new .csv that contains the below variables: Site ID|Site URL|Rating|Image</li>\n<li>Display the new .csv (with all aforementioned items) as an HTML page where there are toggles for \"Ratings\", which when pressed, will log the rating into the .csv which it was imported (or loaded) from. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The \"Image\" section I will be using a piece of software by the name of Paparazzi (on the Mac OS X operating system) which takes a fully formatted screenshot of the main page and saves it as a PNG file. I plan on using the file extension URL (which is stored locally) and load it into the \"Image\" column, thus when the designer clicks on the image, he is able to load the image that is stored locally. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My issue:</strong> As Objective-C is not entirely a scripting language, I am confused with some of the libraries I may need and/or methods I can implement this. I have the algorithm, but I am wholy unsure with the implementation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong> If you have done a project similar to this before with Objective-C, what tips can you provide for me? How does one load the .csv as a HTML interface where upon edit, it will save this edit into the .csv? Will I need any servers for this, or is everything executable from just a machine? How do you grab an image (stored locally), extract its file extension, and load it onto the .csv? </p>\n\n<p>The most important question: Is this achievable through Objective-C? My reasoning behind it is, I want to advance my knowledge of OC through a task like this. Yes, using Python is easier, but is it possible to do this with Objective-C?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","crash","crash-reports"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12954453,"title":"iTunes Connect Crash Report - UINibDecoderDecodeObjectForValue","body":"<p>I have a crash report on iOS 5.1 that is caused by <code>UINibDecoderDecodeObjectForValue</code>.

Something very strange happens: When the App is loaded through Xcode in development it comes up and looks perfect - however, <strong>it won't respond to any touches at all</strong>. I have an alert that pops up on load and you can close that, but the actual main view controller will not react to any drag or touch gestures - it is essentially frozen. However! <strong>When I rotate the device and the App rotates correctly, it suddenly starts working just fine,</strong> even if I rotate it back! The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal. Here is what I have been able to confirm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad3 device: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-retina sim: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-normal sim: <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n<li>iPad2 device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-retina sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-normal sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4S device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4 device: normal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If all the iPhones worked and the iPads didn't, it would make some sense. But my ipad2 works just fine. Also, if I use the iPad3 open it, it is frozen. BUT! <strong>If I hit the 2X button, it starts working</strong> again even without rotation.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to test and see if it would work as a Universal App. On the iPad3 <strong>when I switch it over to Universal, it works just fine to begin with</strong>. So something weird must be going on with the simulator. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n\n<p>-Mark</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","uitableview","properties","indirection"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":39,"score":-1,"question_id":13233367,"title":"Can you use pointer indirection with Objective-C properties?","body":"<p>(<strong>Edit</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, this isn't my best worded question and title.

Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField.

But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach.

I have a paging scroll view that loads its content on demand. As a new page is scrolled to, another is loaded two pages to the right. This happens when the current page is scrolled 50% of screen, and on slower devices the loading is enough of a bottle neck that it interrupts the smoothness of the scroll. The scroll feels like it pauses very briefly at the 50% pint and then jumps back into action.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that there is no network component to my application, so the bottle neck is not while data is fetched - it is all in the loading of the new view.</p>\n\n<p>As I work on improving this, I need to benchmark the transition so I can evaluate the effect of my enhancements.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;!-- saved from url=(0085)file://localhost/Users/litemac/Documents/DamcoAppCoreData/DamcoAppCoreData/index.html --&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\n/* Mobile-specific Styles */\n@media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px) { \ntable[class=w0], td[class=w0] { width: 0 !important; }\ntable[class=w10], td[class=w10], img[class=w10] { width:10px !important; }\ntable[class=w15], td[class=w15], img[class=w15] { width:5px !important; }\ntable[class=w30], td[class=w30], img[class=w30] { width:10px !important; }\ntable[class=w60], td[class=w60], img[class=w60] { width:10px !important; }\ntable[class=w125], td[class=w125], img[class=w125] { width:80px !important; }\ntable[class=w130], td[class=w130], img[class=w130] { width:55px !important; }\ntable[class=w140], td[class=w140], img[class=w140] { width:90px !important; }\ntable[class=w160], td[class=w160], img[class=w160] { width:180px !important; }\ntable[class=w170], td[class=w170], img[class=w170] { width:100px !important; }\ntable[class=w180], td[class=w180], img[class=w180] { width:80px !important; }\ntable[class=w195], td[class=w195], img[class=w195] { width:80px !important; }\ntable[class=w220], td[class=w220], img[class=w220] { width:80px !important; }\ntable[class=w240], td[class=w240], img[class=w240] { width:180px !important; }\ntable[class=w255], td[class=w255], img[class=w255] { width:185px !important; }\ntable[class=w275], td[class=w275], img[class=w275] { width:135px !important; }\ntable[class=w280], td[class=w280], img[class=w280] { width:135px !important; }\ntable[class=w300], td[class=w300], img[class=w300] { width:140px !important; }\ntable[class=w325], td[class=w325], img[class=w325] { width:95px !important; }\ntable[class=w360], td[class=w360], img[class=w360] { width:140px !important; }\ntable[class=w410], td[class=w410], img[class=w410] { width:180px !important; }\ntable[class=w470], td[class=w470], img[class=w470] { width:200px !important; }\ntable[class=w580], td[class=w580], img[class=w580] { width:280px !important; }\ntable[class=w640], td[class=w640], img[class=w640] { width:300px !important; }\ntable[class*=hide], td[class*=hide], img[class*=hide], p[class*=hide], span[class*=hide] { display:none !important; }\ntable[class=h0], td[class=h0] { height: 0 !important; }\np[class=footer-content-left] { text-align: center !important; }\n#headline p { font-size: 30px !important; }\n.article-content, #left-sidebar{ -webkit-text-size-adjust: 90% !important; -ms-text-size-adjust: 90% !important; }\n.header-content, .footer-content-left {-webkit-text-size-adjust: 80% !important; -ms-text-size-adjust: 80% !important;}\nimg { height: auto; line-height: 100%;}\n } \n/* Client-specific Styles */\n#outlook a { padding: 0; }  /* Force Outlook to provide a \"view in browser\" button. */\nbody { width: 100% !important; }\n.ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; }\n.ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */\n/* Reset Styles */\n/* Add 100px so mobile switch bar doesn't cover street address. */\nbody { background-color: #ececec; margin: 0; padding: 0; }\nimg { outline: none; text-decoration: none; display: block;}\nbr, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height:100%; }\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; }\nh1 a, h2 a, h3 a, h4 a, h5 a, h6 a { color: blue !important; }\nh1 a:active, h2 a:active,  h3 a:active, h4 a:active, h5 a:active, h6 a:active { color: red !important; }\n/* Preferably not the same color as the normal header link color.

I am aware that <code>NSDate</code>s are stored independent of timezones (i.e. they are stored relative to UTC/GMT +0000). This means that if I am in Sydney and take attendance on, for example, Sunday 4 November 2012 because the date is stored as timezone independent, if I take my iPhone/iPad to a different time zone (such as San Francisco) all the attendance records would shift one day back, in this case to Saturday 3 November 2012, because that was the moment in time when the attendance was taken in San Francisco local time (which was actually the next day, in Sydney local time).</p>\n\n<p>I don't want this to happen - I want the date to be absolute. In other words, if the attendance is taken on Sunday 4 November 2012 then it needs to stay on that date, no matter where in the world (and whichever timezone) I may go.

Please keep in mind that I am selecting the date to display using a <code>UIDatePickerView</code> which returns the current <code>NSDate</code> in the timezone independent format, so I also need a way to do an easy comparison (preferably in an <code>NSPredicate</code> since the attendance objects are stored in Core Data) to get all the attendance objects for that particular day.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","observer-pattern","addobserver"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13216144,"title":"Unregistering observers of a object during object deallocation","body":"<p>Not sure I am asking this right but I'll give it a try anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have a program which invokes this little bit of code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>[localCalculateTimeFiles addObserver:self\n       forKeyPath:@\"arraystatuscounter\"\n          options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew\n          context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Eventually localCalculateTimeFiles goes away and I'd like to removeObserver the current bit of code (to put it crudely).

I've been banging by head against the wall the last few days after recent unexplained errors that strangely coincided with an X-Code update to ver. 4.5.2. I couldn't find any similar issues anywhere on Google or Stackoveflow.</p>\n\n<p>The shift rotations are set and saved by the user. The process of creating a shift rotation involves presenting a user with a range of dates, and the user associating each date with a particular shift.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Core Data with a sqlite store to manage the saved data. The object graph for the above elements involve  several \"Shift\" NSManagedObject entities which contain the details of a shift, such as title, start and end times, and most importantly a date which allows the shift rotation to be displayed later. The \"Shift\" entities are kept together by another NSManagedObject called \"ShiftRotation\" which has a many-to-one relationship to the \"Shifts\".</p>\n\n<p>My app was working properly until recently, when I made few changes to how I was using these \"Shift\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is this. The user associates a \"Shift\" to a date. The date is stored inside a \"date\" property within the \"Shift\" NSManagedObject. The context is saved. When I access the \"Shift\" later, without making any changes, the date that was assigned to the \"Shift\" appears changed.</p>\n\n<p>I went through my code line by line and added numerous NSLogs to see where or why it's changing, with no results. I noticed that there is no change to the date immediately before AND after I save the context within the class where the save is occurring. There's also no change when I access it from the main Calendar screen. However when I later retrieve the \"Shifts\" from another screen where I manage all shift rotations, they appear to have changed.</p>\n\n<p>The date change is approximately 31 to 32 days in the future.

It seems that I was inadvertently changing the \"date\" property after I was saving the context somewhere else in my code. Perhaps that would have not happened if I had followed carmin's convention (I would have given +1 if I had the reputation). The value was not changing in the Persistent store after all.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sharing how I tracked down this bug might benefit anyone else that might have similar problems, not necessarily related to Core Data. </p>\n\n<p>I used Key Value Observing, to observe the \"date\" property. I began observing immediately after creating the \"Shift\" entity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity addObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and stopped observing after a point in my code where the change had already occurred:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then implemented the KVO method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Object being observed: %@\", [object description]);\n    NSLog(@\"Value changed to: %@\", change[NSKeyValueChangeNewKey]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed a break point at the above method. When the change occurred, it stopped at this point, and told me what had change. Most importantly, when the code stopped executing, I looked at the call stack, and traced my way back through the path that the code took that caused the change. I was able to find exactly where my code was making the change.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have much knowledge using KVO but this experience showed me its usefulness even for debugging purposes.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","iphone-sdk-4.0","core-location"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":13204823,"title":"didUpdateToLocation stop call [solved]","body":"<p>the method - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation; \ncall 1 or 2 times and never more...Why?</p>\n\n<pre><code> -(void) startLocation {\n if (locationManager == nil)\n    locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];\n\nlocationManager.delegate = self;\nlocationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters;\nlocationManager.distanceFilter = 10;\n\n[locationManager startUpdatingLocation];\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and : </p>\n\n<pre><code>       - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation {\ncontadorSegundos++;\nfloat diferencaLatitude = 0;\nfloat diferencaLongitude = 0;\nNSLog(@\"old latitude: %f\", oldLocation.coordinate.latitude);\nNSLog(@\"old longitude: %f\", oldLocation.coordinate.longitude);\n\n\nNSLog(@\"new longitude: %f\", newLocation.coordinate.longitude);\nNSLog(@\"old latitude: %f\", newLocation.coordinate.latitude);\n\nif(oldLocation) {\nif(oldLocation.coordinate.latitude &gt; newLocation.coordinate.latitude)\n    diferencaLatitude = oldLocation.coordinate.latitude - newLocation.coordinate.latitude;\nelse if(newLocation.coordinate.latitude &gt; oldLocation.coordinate.latitude)\n    diferencaLatitude = newLocation.coordinate.latitude - oldLocation.coordinate.latitude;\n}\n\nif (oldLocation) {\n\nif(oldLocation.coordinate.longitude &gt; newLocation.coordinate.longitude)\n    diferencaLongitude = oldLocation.coordinate.longitude - newLocation.coordinate.longitude;\nelse if(newLocation.coordinate.longitude &gt; oldLocation.coordinate.longitude)\n    diferencaLongitude = newLocation.coordinate.longitude - oldLocation.coordinate.longitude;\n}\n\n//NSLog(@\"dif lat %f\", diferencaLatitude);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>// NSLog(@\"dif long %f\", diferencaLongitude);</p>\n\n<pre><code>CLLocationCoordinate2D coord;\nif ((diferencaLatitude &gt; 1) || (diferencaLongitude &gt; 1)) {\n    _emMovimento = YES;\n    NSLog(@\"em movimento\");\n}\nelse {\n    if(contadorSegundos &gt; 10) {\n    _emMovimento = NO;\n    contadorSegundos = 0;\n        NSLog(@\"parado\");\n    }\n}\n\ncoord.longitude = newLocation.coordinate.longitude;\ncoord.latitude = newLocation.coordinate.latitude;\n_latitude = coord.latitude;\n_longitude = coord.longitude;\n\nNSLog(@\"latitude: %f\", _latitude);\nNSLog(@\"longitude: %f\", _longitude);\nMKReverseGeocoder *geocoder = [[MKReverseGeocoder alloc] initWithCoordinate:coord];\n[geocoder setDelegate:self];\n[geocoder start];\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","math"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":13202964,"title":"Convert double decimal to Hex, Binary and Octal strings","body":"<p>Is there a custom or standard library that I can use with objective c to convert a decimal floating point value into Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal NSStrings?</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking around a lot but can only find how to convert the other direction (from everything else into decimal), by using: <code>double result = (double)strtoll(myHexString.UTF8String, NULL,16)</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","nsdictionary","nstableview"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":13213273,"title":"Presenting NSDictionary in UITableView","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11745233/nsdictionary-to-uitableview\">NSDictionary to UITableView</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NSDictionary with keys, for example, @\"first_name\".

It must have a certain level of uncertainty. If you repeat the measurement very often, you will get a distribution of results - probably a gaussian distribution. This gaussian has a certain width, which corresponds to the level of uncertainty of the measurements. Measuring the position more often will reduce the uncertainty and thus increase accuracy, but never will give you a distinct interval where the actual position is guaranteed to be in. You will only get a probability. But if the accuracy is 3sigma, we have 99,7% - which is close to certain. \nTo put it short - I doubt the documentation from Apple.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ftp","nsstream"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":1,"question_id":12845158,"title":"NSStream don't send all data","body":"<p>My case is quite strange:\nI practically used the example \"SimpleFTPSample\" (some small variation of the type [self.networkStream setProperty: (id) kCFBooleanFalse forKey: (NSString *) kCFStreamPropertyFTPAttemptPersistentConnection]; to avoid keeping the connection alive WiFi/3G) to perform transfer operations FTP file but despite not having errors of any kind, your downloaded file is corrupted if you use an ftp site: To resolve this issue, simply add a sleep (3)!

All students are users. In the database (django-ORM based), this is represented as a <code>Student</code> table with a foreign-key to the <code>User</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create a REST API, and an object hierarchy in the iOS app that models this API. I'm having trouble deciding how to model this.</p>\n\n<h1>The Current Solution</h1>\n\n<p>The best I've come up with is this: Have a <code>User</code> model in iOS, have a <code>Student</code> model in iOS which inherits from <code>User</code> and extends it with more properties. Then, have a method which receives a JSON response from the server, and creates <em>either</em> a <code>User</code> or a <code>Student</code> model, depending on the dictinoary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the server will need to always give me the most specific type. I.e., when I log in to the server, it will decide whether I'm a student or just a regular user, and will return me the proper dictionary.</p>\n\n<h1>Is this the best way?</h1>\n\n<p>This sounds a little complicated. But any other way I've thought of modeling it, e.g. changing the way the database is laid out, gives me a design in which the database isn't aware of all the constraints. For example, <code>Student</code> objects are allowed to own other objects (e..g, <code>homework_paper</code>). I can model this with a foreign key to a <code>User</code> object instead of to the <code>Student</code> object, and say that the <code>Student</code> is simply an extension of the user. But then the database doesn't force the fact that a <code>homework_paper</code> has to be owned by a student. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to solve this problem that I'm missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","ipad"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13210702,"title":"add subview and setting frame causing code to lag","body":"<p>I have the following code:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xmvMU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9Ihm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to optimize the code, for some reason <code>initWithRootViewController,  [self.view addSubview:fullStory.view];,</code> \n and setting the frame to the view's superframe is the biggest performance hurdle.

There is no error in the output window, it just stops and shows the following in the debugger...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHOUo.png\" alt=\"Xcode Crash Snapshot\"></p>\n\n<p>When stepping through the code it crashes in ..</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while executing ..</p>\n\n<pre><code>UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@\"CellIdentifier\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I did an NSLog just prior to this line with the \"tableview\" and indexPath\" when running on both iPad 6 and iPad 5.1 the output is almost identical apart from  \"gestureRecognizers = ;\" in the IOS 6 one ..</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSLog(@\"Table: %@, Index: %@\", tableView, indexPath);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>IOS 5.1</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-11-03 10:26:33.775 BusTimes[45321:c07] Table: &lt;UITableView: 0x8baf800; frame = (0 0; 768 911); clipsToBounds = YES; autoresize = W+H; layer = &lt;CALayer: 0x80b4f80&gt;; contentOffset: {0, 0}&gt;, Index: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x82cc580&gt; 2 indexes [0, 0]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>IOS 6.0</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-11-03 10:29:26.368 BusTimes[45377:c07] Table: &lt;UITableView: 0x9b90400; frame = (0 0; 768 911); clipsToBounds = YES; autoresize = W+H; gestureRecognizers = &lt;NSArray: 0x95a5ed0&gt;; layer = &lt;CALayer: 0x95e8ff0&gt;; contentOffset: {0, 0}&gt;, Index: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x95dcba0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 0]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As mentioned previously it works on iPhone at 5.1 and 6, and iPad at IOS 6 but not 5.1.

Which to me sounds like it is timing out, but the problem with that theory is that the <code>netService:didNotResolve:</code> is not being called either.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update: 11-02-12 23:09 PDT</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I thought I would add the code to make this a little easier, so the interface and implementation for the class I mention above are listed below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n *  interface\n */\n\n#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;\n\n@class AFHTTPRequestOperation;\n\n@interface ABDevice : NSObject\n- (id)initWithService:(NSNetService*)service;\n- (void)sendClip:(NSString*)clip\n         success:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , id responseObject ))success\n         failure:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , NSError *error ))failure;\n@end\n\n\n/*\n *  implementation\n */\n\n\n#import \"ABDevice.h\"\n#import \"AFHTTPClient.h\"\n#import \"AFHTTPRequestOperation.h\"\n\n@interface ABDevice () &lt;NSNetServiceDelegate&gt;\n@property (strong) NSNetService* service;\n@end\n\n\n@implementation ABDevice\n\n- (id)initWithService:(NSNetService*)service\n{\n    self = [super init];\n    if (self) {\n        self.service = service;\n        self.service.delegate = self;\n        [self.service resolveWithTimeout:5];\n    }\n    return self;\n}\n\n- (void)sendClip:(NSString*)clip\n         success:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , id responseObject ))success\n         failure:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , NSError *error ))failure\n{\n    NSDictionary *params = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:clip, @\"clip\", nil];\n\n    NSString *url =[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"http://%@:%d\", self.service.hostName, (int)self.service.port];\n\n    AFHTTPClient *client = [AFHTTPClient clientWithBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]];\n    [client postPath:@\"\" parameters:params success:success failure:failure];\n}\n\n#pragma mark NSNetServiceDelegate\n\n- (void)netServiceDidResolveAddress:(NSNetService *)sender\n{\n    NSURL* serviceURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"http://%@:%li\",\n                                              sender.hostName, sender.port]];\n    NSLog(@\"Resolved address for service %@: %@\", sender, serviceURL);\n}\n\n- (void)netService:(NSNetService *)sender\n     didNotResolve:(NSDictionary *)errorDict\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Couldn't resolve address for service %@: %@\", sender, errorDict);\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","xcode"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":248,"score":0,"question_id":11825863,"title":"How to set RGB color value for Section header - IOS","body":"<p>I have tried with following code for my header view.
