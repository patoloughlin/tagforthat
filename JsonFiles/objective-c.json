I'm using the parse.com service, and PFObjects to store the players plants/buildings etc.</p>\n\n<p>I'm posting this question not just to help with the issue I'm having but it may contain information that might be of use to others (especially people who are not experts in this stuff).</p>\n\n<p>I'm new to obj-c/ios and even database/server coding, but I've managed to get things working ok so far.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, if the player plants a tree a PFObject is created and updated on the server with saveInBackground, obviously this will lead to a lot of API requests, so I've been thinking of ways to try and cut down the number of requests to the server.</p>\n\n<p>2 possible solutions that I can see would be...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The PFObjects that are created/changed are put into an array, and\nevery xx number of seconds, all the PFObjects in that array are\nsaved in one go with a saveAll command. This would probably work\nfine but I'm bothered about situations where the player exits the\napp or worse the app crashes, meaning that the PFObjects that now\ncontain new data are not updated on the server and are lost, so when\nthe player loads the game back up, they will see an older state of\nthe game.</p></li>\n<li><p>Always keep an offline version of the PFObjects. When the game\n    loads, it checks the offline version to see if the online version of\n    the data is newer or older if it's older then it uploads the new\n    (offline) data to parse, and then continues with that. I don't\n    really see any problem with that other than I don't know how to do\n    it! :p</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding point 1. Parse have told me the following...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The app will be terminated before the save operation finishes, by\n  default. You can request a background execution task that should give\n  you enough time to finish saving objects in the background. You can\n  see an example of this in Anypic's source code:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic/blob/master/Anypic-iOS/Anypic/PAPEditPhotoViewController.m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anypic/blob/master/Anypic-iOS/Anypic/PAPEditPhotoViewController.m</a></p>\n  \n  <p>self.photoPostBackgroundTaskId = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]\n  beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:^{\n          [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTask:self.photoPostBackgroundTaskId];\n      }];</p>\n  \n  <p>You'll want to look up beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler: in\n  the iOS docs for more info.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that's definitely an avenue I could explore although it looks a fairly complex one, and I'm a little bothered by the use of \"should give you enough time\" to save the objects, meaning maybe there will be situations when it's not.</p>\n\n<p>So (finally) on to my questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Of those 2 solutions offered above, in the view of the experts on here, which is going to be the most straightforward (i'e easy for a beginner) solution for me to have a go at?</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding point 2. There seems to be a myriad of ways to save infomation offline in ios, I've read about NSUserDefaults, SQLLite, plists, core data and so on. All I'll be looking to do is save a few arrays of PFObjects offline, that's all, no files, no graphics etc. Although there will be a lot of PFObjects to save probably around a 1000. As with point 1, which will be the most straightforward way to save this data offline? What would be great would be to have a few lines of code that saves it all out locally, and I can use a few lines to read it all back in and re-populate the PFObjects if needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again regarding point 2.

During drag and drop, I'd like to make it so that a gap for the item-to-be-dropped opens up at the location under the mouse. GarageBand does something like this when you drag to reorder tracks (video here: <a href=\"http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl</a>). As far as I can tell, there's no built in support for this in NSTableView. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else tried to add this behavior to NSTableView and found a good solution? I've thought of and tried a couple approaches without much success. My first thought was to double the height of the row under the mouse during a drag by sending <code>-noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code> in my data source's <code>-tableView:validateDrop:...</code> method, then returning twice the normal height in <code>-tableView:heightOfRow:</code>. Unfortunately, best I can tell, NSTableView doesn't update its layout during drag and drop, so despite calling <code>noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code>, the row height isn't actually updated.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I'm using a view-based NSTableView, but my rows are not so complex that I couldn't move to a cell-based table view if doing so helped accomplish this. I'm aware of the easy, built-in ability to animate a gap for the dropped item after a drag is complete. I'm looking for a way to open a gap while the drag is in progress. Also, this is for an app to be sold in the Mac App Store, so it must not use private API.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've just filed an enhancement request with Apple requesting built in support for this behavior: <a href=\"http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624</a>.

Any drawing done by the view is the cached in the backing layer. You configured a layer-backed view by simply invoking <code>setWantsLayer:</code> with a value of <code>YES</code>. The view class will automatically create the a backing layer for you, and you use the view class’s drawing mechanisms. <strong>When using layer-backed views you should never interact directly with the layer.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>A layer-hosting view is a view that contains a Core Animation layer that you intend to manipulate directly. You create a layer-hosting view by instantiating an instance of a Core Animation layer class and setting that layer using the view’s <code>setLayer:</code> method. After doing so, you then invoke <code>setWantsLayer:</code> with a value of <code>YES</code>. <strong>When using a layer-hosting view you should not rely on the view for drawing, nor should you add subviews to the layer-hosting view.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and then generating a <code>CGColorRef</code> out of a <code>CGPattern</code> which draws my <code>CGImage</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSView *mainView = [[self window]contentView];\n[mainView setWantsLayer:YES];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To set the background image as a pattern I used the answer from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2520978/how-to-tile-the-contents-of-a-calayer\">How to tile the contents of a CALayer</a> here on SO to get the first task done.</p>\n\n<p>However for the second task, adding the icon I used the code below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CGImageRef iconImage = NULL;\nNSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"icon_128\" ofType:@\"png\"];\nif(path != nil) {\n    NSURL *imageURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path];\n    provider = CGDataProviderCreateWithURL((CFURLRef)imageURL);\n    iconImage = CGImageCreateWithPNGDataProvider(provider,NULL,FALSE,kCGRenderingIntentDefault); \n    CFRelease(provider);\n}\nCALayer *iconLayer = [[CALayer alloc] init];\n// layer is the mainView's layer\nCGRect layerFrame = layer.frame;\nCGFloat iconWidth = 128.f;\niconLayer.frame = CGRectMake(0.f, CGRectGetHeight(layerFrame)-iconWidth, 128.f, 128.f);\niconLayer.contents = (id)iconImage;\nCGImageRelease(iconImage);\n[layer insertSublayer:iconLayer  atIndex:0];\n[iconLayer release];\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>The Questions</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am not sure if I am violating Apple's restrictions concerning <em>layer-backed</em> views that you should never interact directly with the layer.

I want to point out that this content view of course has several subviews such as labels, a text view and buttons.</li>\n<li>It seems to me that just using one single <em>layer-hosting</em> <code>NSView</code> seems to be the cleanest solution. All the text labels could then be added as <code>CATextLayers</code> etc. However if I understand Apple's documentation correctly I cannot add any controls to the view anymore. Would I have to code all the controls myself in custom <code>CALayers</code> to get it working? Sounds like reinventing the wheel <em>de luxe</em>.

Traditionally, we compiled the code we needed into a .dll and called that .dll when we needed a calculation done. We are now trying to create an iPad app, which unfortunately means we can't just call a .dll anymore. </p>\n\n<p>One of my coworkers have managed to make a simple Command Line Tool project, where we call a Fortran file to write \"Hello, World\" in the debugger.  However, when I try to get it to work on view based iPad app, I get a bunch of linker errors saying the symbols I'm using cannot be found.  I know that the Command Line Tool uses a .cpp file to actually run the Fortran, and I've seen many threads concerning calling .cpp files in an app, but all the ones I've seen are outdated, directly contradict each other, and their fixes don't work for me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a more direct way to call Fortran straight from a .m file?  If not, what do I have to do to take the working Command Line Tool and get it into an app?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 1: following the tutorials posted in the comments, I have been able to create a .o file from my Fortran code.  I can do a File-Add Files to add it in easily enough, but now how do I actually call it?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: Okay, baby steps.  I found out you can make a .a static library (I'll call it \"new_library\") from .o files (\"source_file.o\") using the Terminal command <code>ar crv new_library.a source_file.o</code> (you can do it for multiple .o files by just adding <code>source_file2.o source_file3.o</code> for as many .o files as you want - NOTE: make sure you use <code>cd</code> to get to the folder where the .o files are located).  I'm pretty sure Xcode will work with .a files, but it seems a .h file is still needed to let the other files in the project (like the view controllers) make calls to what's in the .a file. I know I can make a new .a file from Xcode itself (New Project -> iOS -> Framework &amp; Library -> Cocoa Touch Static Library), but when I've done it that way in the past, I just write normal .m and .h files, and when I build the new library it just mashes all the .m files into 1 .a.  When I want to use the code in that .a in another project, I just import the .a and all the .h files into the new project, and I can call the methods in the .a file just as if I had imported all the separate .m files.  So the next question is, do I still need a .h when my .a is made with the terminal instead of Xcode?  If so, how would I make a Fortran header file?  If not, how do I call my Fortran code in the .a?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","osx","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13274955,"title":"Changing reference to different object without changing initially referenced object?","body":"<p>I'm currently trying to write an XML-parser with the help of NSXMLParser.

How do you do that?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>\n\n<p>Giannandrea</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c"],"answer_count":11,"favorite_count":46,"up_vote_count":71,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26655,"score":71,"question_id":1347779,"title":"How to navigate through textfields (Next / Done Buttons)","body":"<p>how can i navigate through all my text fields with the \"Next\" Button on the iPhone Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>The last text field should close the Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>I setup in the IB the Buttons (Next / Done) but now im stuck.</p>\n\n<p>I implemented the textFieldShouldReturn action but now the Next and Done Buttons close the Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ipad","uiimageview","uitextview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":23,"score":-2,"question_id":13273402,"title":"How to jump the cursor points next line to the imageView after inserting image with in the UITextview","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13265607/how-to-move-jump-the-cursor-next-line-to-the-image-view-after-inserting-image-wi\">How to move/jump the cursor next line to the image view after inserting image with in the text view</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Possibel <strong>duplicate</strong> of</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13265607/how-to-move-jump-the-cursor-next-line-to-the-image-view-after-inserting-image-wi\">How to move/jump the cursor next line to the image view after inserting image with in the text view</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","nsdate","nsdateformatter"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":13273189,"title":"Using dateformatter and timezone to get a NSDate","body":"<p>I'm using the following code to format the GMT date to my time and zone date:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];\ndateFormatter.dateFormat = @\"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\";\ndateFormatter.timeZone = [NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation:@\"BRT\"];\nNSString *dateTime = [dateFormatter stringFromDate:[NSDate date]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But now I need the output to be a NSDate, because I need to compare that date to another date <strong>(a date in a specific time and zone)</strong>.

This is because it assumes all my images are of size 200x200px, which fits 3 images per row (hence the division by 3). </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even with the +300 that I have, the last row I can only see about 3/4 of it and not all of it. I have to scroll more and I will be able to see it but it goes back up again to 3/4. Its kind of like the scroll to refresh, where the view only moves if you drag it and when you leave it bumps back to where it was. Why is this happening? Is it just that Apple designed <code>UICollectionView</code> so poorly? This is a little ridiculous...

The workaround is to to unbind all bindings before the window controller is <strong>released</strong>, not before it is <strong>deallocated</strong>, in a place like windowWillClose:. This seems like an unnecessary hack to me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: Is there any way to make custom bindings that work as well as the ones made by Apple, without using undocumented features? Am I going about this the wrong way?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: I have found a solution that allows manually implemented bindings to work exactly like Apple's bindings.

However, the <code>NSObject</code> implementation of <code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> half works. It propogates changes from bindee to binder (i.e. from model/controller to view), but doesn't work the opposite way. Also, although the bindee is obviously being observed, <code>observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:</code> is never triggered.</p>\n\n<p>Example project here: <a href=\"http://www.tomdalling.com/wp-content/BindingsTest.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tomdalling.com/wp-content/BindingsTest.zip</a></p>\n\n<p>Apple's documentation indicates that you do, in fact, have to override <code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> to implement manual bindings.

NSAutounbinder is a non-retaining proxy for the NSWindowController object. It is non-retaining to avoid the retain cycle problem.</p>\n\n<p>When -[NSWindowController release] is called and retainCount == 1, The NSAutounbinder unbinds all bindings to itself.

This is no good, since, although it is now sorted nicely, it no longer contains punctuation which is crucial to the array in the first place. What I need to do is sort 'arrayWithPunctuation' according to the order of 'arrayWithoutPunctuation'...

I have an extension method to <code>NSMutableArray</code> to move an item from one index to another.  It's a fairly simple method and it works flawlessly when I compile my app in Debug Configuration.  However, if I compile the app in Release Configuration, it crashes if I move from an item down (from index > to index).  The crash isn't a an index out of bounds error.  My local variable are being messed up and I have no idea why.  Here's the entire method: </p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)    moveObjectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)fromIndex toIndex:(NSUInteger)toIndex{\n    if (fromIndex == toIndex) return; \n    if (fromIndex &gt;= self.count) return; \n    if (toIndex &gt;= self.count) toIndex = self.count - 1; //toIndex too large, assume a move to end\n    id movingObject = [self objectAtIndex:fromIndex];\n\n    if (fromIndex &lt; toIndex){\n        for (int i = fromIndex; i &lt;= toIndex; i++){\n            [self replaceObjectAtIndex:i withObject:(i == toIndex) ? movingObject : [self objectAtIndex:i + 1]];\n        }\n    } else {\n        //The problem occurs in this block (though the crash doesn't always occur here)\n        id cObject;\n        id prevObject;\n        for (int i = toIndex; i &lt;= fromIndex; i++){\n            //usually on the last loop, my \"prevObject\" become 'messed up' after the following line:\n            cObject = [self objectAtIndex:i];\n            [self replaceObjectAtIndex:i withObject:(i == toIndex) ? movingObject : prevObject];\n            prevObject = cObject;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can't step through the code since it's a release build, but I've NSLogged the variables at each step through the loop.

Sometimes it's set to <code>nil</code> but often it's some other random variable in my code.  If it's <code>nil</code> the code crashes when I try to replace the object in the array.  Otherwise, it crashes later on when I try to access the array and receive back the wrong object.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

Shouldn't this be done somewhere where initialization is done (e.g. viewDidLoad of the view controller)? The problem might be that your array is never actually set up, or is only partly set up. Also, putting the setup here means it will be called over and over, mutating your array each time and screwing things up.</li>\n<li>Your tags are off by one. You should be assigning them starting at 0, not 1 (or accounting for the difference in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:). If your code was working, it would skip 2 text fields, as the first field would return tag 1, and you'd skip to objectAtIndex:2, which is the 3rd field.</li>\n<li>You don't account for going off the end. If you're at the last field, incrementing will not go back to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd actually recommend not using tags at all. Instead, at setup time, just loop through the fields adding them in order to your array. Then, in inputAccessoryViewDidSelectNext:, use a counter instead of fast enumeration to figure out where you are.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","bookmarks","epub"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1185,"score":2,"question_id":9987038,"title":"iOS : How to implement a bookmark for ePub reader?","body":"<p>I'm create an ePub reader for iPad/iPhone</p>\n\n<p>The basic code is from <a href=\"https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader\" rel=\"nofollow\">AePubReader</a></p>\n\n<p>I add page curl effect,adjust image size ... but remove some function (ex.slider the page)</p>\n\n<p>But I still don't know how to implement bookmark function ...</p>\n\n<p>We have many <a href=\"https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader/issues/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion here</a>  , some people record the page number as bookmark index</p>\n\n<p>This is a solution , but not good enough , if you wanna add mark in page 100 .</p>\n\n<p>When you change the text size , you may not found the paragraph you want in p.100</p>\n\n<p>So , as I say in the issue discuss , I need to do few things ...</p>\n\n<p>1.Set &lt; p >  tag or id</p>\n\n<p>2.Get the &lt; p > in  every page </p>\n\n<p>3.Press the bookmark button means record the top &lt; P > in current page ,if the the top &lt; P > is from previous page , record the previous page's last &lt; P ></p>\n\n<p>4.Search the &lt; P > by tag ,  if match , show the page number .</p>\n\n<p>So ...

(e.g. Under \"Custom Objects\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've read the following, but I still can't get it to work (Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard) :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Adding Custom Objects to the Library</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Although you normally drag items out of the Library window and into\n  your user interface, you can also drag your custom configurations of\n  those objects back into the Library window. Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","uitableview","ios5","uitableviewcell"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":13249658,"title":"UITableViewCell is not clickable","body":"<p>I have a custom UITableViewCell with lot of buttons, textfields, labels and a view.

The unmanaged object will persist persist forever (I think? dealloc never called), and the managed object will be harvested early.  Seems to be lose-lose all-around, but runs in practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Saves a reference of the managed object.  The unmanaged object is left alone, and dealloc appears to be invoked at a reasonable time by the caller.  At this point the managed object is released and disposed.  This seems reasonable, but on the downside the base type's dealloc won't be run (I think?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Increases the retain count and saves a reference.  Unmanaged and managed objects leak forever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Extends Method 3 by adding a cleanup function that is run periodically (e.g. during Init of each new ImageAndTextCell object).  The cleanup function checks the retain counts of the stored objects.  A retain count of 1 means the caller has released it, so we should as well.  Should eliminate leaking in theory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 5:</strong> Attempt to invoke the copyWithZone method on the base type, and then construct a new ImageAndTextView object with the resulting handle.  Seems to do the right thing (the base data is cloned).  Internally, NSObject bumps the retain count on objects constructed like this, so we also use the PeriodicCleanup function to release these objects when they're no longer used.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, I believe Method 5 is the best approach since it should be the only one that results in a truly correct copy of the base type data, but I don't know if the approach is inherently dangerous (I am also making some assumptions about the underlying implementation of NSObject).  So far nothing bad has happened \"yet\", but if anyone is able to vet my analysis then I would be more confident going forward.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","error-handling","uiactivityviewcontroller"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13239684,"title":"Apple Mach-O Linker error (APActivityIcon)","body":"<p>I've a problem!

you need to wait till the views for the new annotations are already added.</p>\n\n<p>So I do this awkward thing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   if (destinationToBeAdded.count==0)\n    {\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        for (BGAddressAnnotation * newAnnotations in destinationToBeAdded) {\n            [self.theMapView addAnnotation:newAnnotations];\n        }\n        @synchronized(self)\n        {\n            self.annotationsTrulyAdded=false;\n        }\n        while (self.annotationsTrulyAdded==false) {\n            [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:.1]];\n\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this is awkward. What will happen if users change he screen again before the new annotations are added? What would be the best way?</p>\n\n<p>I can put them all in a block. But then it'll be a queue of block. I could use NSOperationQueue. But I want that executed after the new annotations added. So I need to be able to pause the NSOperationQueue till that happen. Well, I am confused.</p>\n\n<p>Actually what will be a better approach?</p>\n\n<p>Basically the same principle may work too for autocomplete where users insert rapid action.</p>\n\n<p>Basically what I want to do is:</p>\n\n<p>User interact\n->Queue a block that will add new annotations appropriately\n->If some annotations are added execute the block at didAddAnnotationsView when the newly added annotations view are already added\n->wait till animation finish before executing another block in a queue</p>\n\n<p>Not really sure how to do it yet.</p>\n\n<p>Is NSOperationQueue has a method where we can consecutively execute blocks one at a time?

Others working with Salesforce and REST have run into the same issue (ref <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/restkit/HJNjB7I6WVM/8u5n7nHoJQUJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/restkit/HJNjB7I6WVM/8u5n7nHoJQUJ</a>).  I created a class to wrap the calls to Salesforce and automatically follow these links, and process the returned data sets correctly.  The class instance registers itself as the delegate for the REST call.</p>\n\n<p>The class I wrote works great on its own (when there's a single instance), but I'll be creating other classes and have several instances that will need to handle their data independently.  I've read through the documentation and code (it's been a learning experience, I've only worked with ios for about a month now), but I can't see if it's guaranteed that a particular instance will respond as the delegate for its requests alone, or if it might accidentally pick up the responses for another instance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose I have instances A and B, both of which are making requests using RKObjectLoader, and which set themselves as delegates using <code>loader.delegate = self;</code>.  Both are running simultaneously (asynchronous).  Here's a potential flow I see:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A's RKObjectLoader makes call, registers self as delegate for response</li>\n<li>RestKit framework sends request for A</li>\n<li>B's RKObjectLoader makes call, registers self as delegate for response</li>\n<li>RestKit framework sends request for B</li>\n<li>... wait ...</li>\n<li>RestKit framework gets response, <strong>and somehow determines that this response was from B's request, calling B as the delegate</strong></li>\n<li>B delegate methods get called</li>\n<li>RestKit framework gets response, <strong>and somehow determines that this response was from A's request, calling A as the delegate</strong></li>\n<li>A delegate methods get called</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I couldn't see how the RestKit framework would distinguish between responses from requests, and thereby ensure that the correct delegate instances get called.  In other words, it appears to me that RestKit might get a response to a request, and then call any delegate it wants ... but that seems counterintuitive, and the framework author appears to be very sharp.</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If I have a class instance using RKObjectLoader and setting itself as the delegate, can I be guaranteed that it will be called when the response for that request comes in?</li>\n<li>Can you point me to the actual implementation in the RestKit framework that handles this, so I can learn how it's done?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks very much!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","connection","nsurlconnection","3g"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":1,"question_id":13239714,"title":"iOS - 3G slow connection issue when connecting to back-end API server","body":"<p>Currently I am working on an App which requires serveral calls to a back-end server.\nWhen on Wifi the App connects fine and downloads very fast the data, but when on 3G the connection seems a bit unstable and very slow.</p>\n\n<p>So I have done some very simple testcases (which you find below).

I plan on using the file extension URL (which is stored locally) and load it into the \"Image\" column, thus when the designer clicks on the image, he is able to load the image that is stored locally. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My issue:</strong> As Objective-C is not entirely a scripting language, I am confused with some of the libraries I may need and/or methods I can implement this. I have the algorithm, but I am wholy unsure with the implementation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong> If you have done a project similar to this before with Objective-C, what tips can you provide for me? How does one load the .csv as a HTML interface where upon edit, it will save this edit into the .csv? Will I need any servers for this, or is everything executable from just a machine? How do you grab an image (stored locally), extract its file extension, and load it onto the .csv? </p>\n\n<p>The most important question: Is this achievable through Objective-C?

I have a iPhone App that I have been updating for over a year and it has been working just fine on my iPad2, iPhone 3GS, as well as the 4G, 4GS, and 5. However, just recently I obtained an iPad3 to test the App on. Something very strange happens: When the App is loaded through Xcode in development it comes up and looks perfect - however, <strong>it won't respond to any touches at all</strong>. I have an alert that pops up on load and you can close that, but the actual main view controller will not react to any drag or touch gestures - it is essentially frozen. However! <strong>When I rotate the device and the App rotates correctly, it suddenly starts working just fine,</strong> even if I rotate it back! The simulator for the iPad running iOS6 in normal and retina does the same thing even though it works just fine on my iPad2. However, the simulator for the iPhone works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, this doesn't happen on any other device. Even loaded the same way all devices allow tapping like normal. Here is what I have been able to confirm:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad3 device: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-retina sim: <strong>frozen</strong> </li>\n<li>iPad-normal sim: <strong>frozen</strong></li>\n<li>iPad2 device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-retina sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone-normal sim: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4S device: normal</li>\n<li>iPhone 4 device: normal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If all the iPhones worked and the iPads didn't, it would make some sense. But my ipad2 works just fine. Also, if I use the iPad3 open it, it is frozen. BUT! <strong>If I hit the 2X button, it starts working</strong> again even without rotation.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to test and see if it would work as a Universal App. On the iPad3 <strong>when I switch it over to Universal, it works just fine to begin with</strong>. So something weird must be going on with the simulator.

It would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>On user opened image apply CIColorControls -&gt; on CIColorControls output image apply CISepia.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>The question</h2>\n\n<p>Is it possible to do something like this:</p>\n\n<p>After applying any effect, add some string in NSMutableArray or NSMutableDictionary. Then when applying another effect, check NSMutableArray or NSMutableDictionary contents like that:</p>\n\n<p>if object at index 0 is equal to \"blur\", apply blur on source image, then take blur's output image like current effect's input image</p>\n\n<p>And so on? So that effects would be re-applied every time in their sequence made by user.</p>\n\n<p>If it is possible maybe someone could suggest me any solution? </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","objective-c","monotouch","monodevelop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":1,"question_id":13220389,"title":"Binding to Objective C library (VFR Reader)","body":"<p>I'm new to MonoTouch development and I would like to embed some PDF Viewing functionality in my app. I have found several resources for doing that, however, I also see enough remarks about all the additional implementations to make it stable and fast.</p>\n\n<p>I now see that there is a good ObjectiveC library which already implements a lot of functionality (CATiledLayer, multi-threading, page scrolling, thumb nails, device rotation ...): <a href=\"https://github.com/vfr/Reader\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vfr/Reader</a> </p>\n\n<p>The last days, after reading the monotoch binding documentation, I'm trying to bind this in MonoTouch, but without success.\nI'm able to export it to a library (.a) file and I've created a binding API.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    //@interface ReaderDocument : NSObject &lt;NSObject, NSCoding&gt;\n    [BaseType (typeof (NSObject))]\n    interface ReaderDocument {\n\n    //- (id)initWithFilePath:(NSString *)fullFilePath password:(NSString *)phrase;\n    [Export(\"initWithFilePath:password\")]\n    IntPtr Constructor (string path, string phrase);\n\n    //Properties\n    [Export(\"guid\")]\n    string Guid { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"fileDate\")]\n    NSDate FileDate { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"lastOpen\")]\n    NSDate LastOpen { get;set;}\n\n    [Export(\"fileSize\")]\n    NSNumber FileSize{ get;}\n\n    [Export(\"pageCount\")]\n    NSNumber PageCount { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"pageNumber\")]\n    NSNumber PageNumber { get;set;}\n\n    [Export(\"bookmarks\")]\n    NSMutableIndexSet Bookmarks { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"fileName\")]\n    string FileName { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"password\")]\n    string Password { get;}\n\n    [Export(\"fileURL\")]\n    NSUrl FileURL { get;}\n\n    //Methods\n\n    //+ (ReaderDocument *)withDocumentFilePath:(NSString *)filename password:(NSString *)phrase;\n    [Static, Export(\"withDocumentFilePath:password\")]\n    ReaderDocument WithDocumentFilePath(string filename, string phrase);\n\n    //+ (ReaderDocument *)unarchiveFromFileName:(NSString *)filename password:(NSString *)phrase;\n    [Static, Export(\"unarchiveFromFileName:password\")]\n    ReaderDocument UnarchiveFromFileName(string filename, string phrase);\n\n    //- (void)saveReaderDocument;\n    [Export(\"saveReaderDocument\")]\n    void SaveReaderDocument();\n\n    //- (void)updateProperties;\n    [Export(\"updateProperties\")]\n    void updateProperties();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm very unsure about following line btw:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//@interface ReaderDocument : NSObject &lt;NSObject, NSCoding&gt;\n    [BaseType (typeof (NSObject))]\n    interface ReaderDocument\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not sure if I have to do something with the \"\"?</p>\n\n<p>I can now create following code in MonoTouch</p>\n\n<pre><code>ReaderDocument doc =  ReaderDocument.withDocumentFilePath(\"Tamarin.pdf\",\"\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>ReaderDocument doc = new ReaderDocument(\"Tamarin.pdf\",\"yrt\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both are resulting in \"unrecognized selector\" error</p>\n\n<pre><code>  2012-11-04 22:15:05.731 PFDTest1[4149:1507] +[ReaderDocument withDocumentFilePath:password]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x2f7738\n\n[ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C     exception thrown.

Each section has 4 cells. Each cell contains a textField. When the user presses <code>Edit</code> button (located on the <code>navigationBar</code>), the user can change the position of the cells, i.e. - s/he can move the cells from one section to another. Simple!</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been considering three approaches.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Include a <code>UIButton</code> object with each cell. The button could have an image of + or -. - move cell from second section to first and + moves cells from first section to second. But once the change has been made, the image of the button should change from + to - or vice versa. But I realized that I cannot change the image of the button programmatically. So I will have to make two sets of buttons for each cell =>  16 buttons + 16 button <code>@property</code> to change <code>hidden</code> from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> and opposite. I personally think this is not the best approach. Even worse, I will have to keep a track of the index where the cell should appear when it translates from one section to another.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have 8 cells in section 1 and 2. 4 cells of second section appear as hidden in the first section and vice versa. When the user presses + in one section A, its property should be set to hidden in section A and it should be made visible in section B. However, when the cell's property is set to hidden, a void is created in its place which looks very ugly. Is there a way to fill the void? Also, if I use a grouped cells, the remaining cell at the end of section will not have rounded bottom corners.</p></li>\n<li><p>User can drag cells from one section to another. (FYI.. drag is represented by three horizontal lines.) Issues: how popular is the drag feature? Will the users interpret it without being suggested by the app? If this the best approach, how do I implement it?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would be glad if you kindly help me pick the best option.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>what if there were three sections, is it possible to change/ move fields between 2 and 3, without making any changes to section 1?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","performance","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":109,"score":5,"question_id":12998733,"title":"Benchmarking performance using Instruments","body":"<p>I am looking for some advice on how to use Instruments' Time Profiler to enhance a specific operation. I have a paging scroll view that loads its content on demand. As a new page is scrolled to, another is loaded two pages to the right. This happens when the current page is scrolled 50% of screen, and on slower devices the loading is enough of a bottle neck that it interrupts the smoothness of the scroll. The scroll feels like it pauses very briefly at the 50% pint and then jumps back into action.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that there is no network component to my application, so the bottle neck is not while data is fetched - it is all in the loading of the new view.</p>\n\n<p>As I work on improving this, I need to benchmark the transition so I can evaluate the effect of my enhancements.

I'm using XCode 3.2.3 in OSX 10.6.4.  It started as a standard iPhone \"Window Based Application\".  Using interface builder I have added a Tab Bar Controller using the O'Reilly video tutorial here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/06/tab-bars-and-navigation-bars-t.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/06/tab-bars-and-navigation-bars-t.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In the first Tab I have a standard UIView with two buttons.  Both call the same function to display a UIImagePickerController:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(IBAction) btnPhotoClicked:(id)sender {\nUIImagePickerController *imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];\nimagePicker.delegate = self;\nif((UIButton *)sender == btnChoosePhoto)\n{\n    imagePicker.allowsEditing = YES;\n    imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum;\n} else {\n    imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;\n}\n\n[self presentModalViewController:imagePicker animated:YES];\n[imagePicker release];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am running the code inside an emulator so only ever click the button called Choose Photo.  When the dialogue is released with a photo chosen this function runs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary  *)info {\nNSURL *mediaUrl;\n\nmediaUrl = (NSURL *)[info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL];\n\nif (mediaUrl == nil)\n{\n    imagePuzzle = (UIImage *) [info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage];\n    if(imagePuzzle == nil)\n    {\n        //--- Original Image was selected ---\n        imagePuzzle = (UIImage *) [info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];\n    }\n    else {\n        //--- Get the edited image ---\n        //--- If it was successful the above valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage\n        //--- would have assigned it already.\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    //--- Muppet selected a video\n}\n\n// Animate the picker window going away\n[picker dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\nImageViewController *imageViewController = [[ImageViewController alloc] init];\nimageViewController.delegate = self;    \n[self presentModalViewController:imageViewController animated:YES];\n[imageViewController release];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is where my problem lies.  I've tried many different hacks and iterations but the above code is the simplest to present the problem.  When the imageViewController is displayed as a modal dialogue the following exception is thrown:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2010-07-09 15:29:29.667 Golovomka[15183:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught\nexception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Attempting to begin a modal\ntransition from &lt;NewViewController: 0x5915f80&gt; to &lt;ImageViewController: 0x594a350&gt;     \nwhile a transition is already in progress.

I have tried delays and other tricks but do not really understand how I'm supposed to use viewDidAppear or viewDidDisappear to help me.  Also of note is that a very basic application with one view loading the picker then displaying another view with the image in does not produce the error.

Each attendance entry is stored in an object which has a status attribute (e.g. present, absent) and an <code>NSDate</code> attribute called <code>date</code> which denotes the day which that attendance record was taken. When I select a particular date (using a <code>UIDatePickerView</code> or alike) I want all the attendance records (objects) for that date to appear in a table view.</p>\n\n<p>While this sounds simple in principle, I am running into an issue relating to timezones. I am aware that <code>NSDate</code>s are stored independent of timezones (i.e. they are stored relative to UTC/GMT +0000). This means that if I am in Sydney and take attendance on, for example, Sunday 4 November 2012 because the date is stored as timezone independent, if I take my iPhone/iPad to a different time zone (such as San Francisco) all the attendance records would shift one day back, in this case to Saturday 3 November 2012, because that was the moment in time when the attendance was taken in San Francisco local time (which was actually the next day, in Sydney local time).</p>\n\n<p>I don't want this to happen - I want the date to be absolute. In other words, if the attendance is taken on Sunday 4 November 2012 then it needs to stay on that date, no matter where in the world (and whichever timezone) I may go. As you can see, this is quite in contrast to, say, a calendar application where it is desirable for the timing of appointments to change depending on the timezone.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on a better way to approach this problem would be appreciated. Please keep in mind that I am selecting the date to display using a <code>UIDatePickerView</code> which returns the current <code>NSDate</code> in the timezone independent format, so I also need a way to do an easy comparison (preferably in an <code>NSPredicate</code> since the attendance objects are stored in Core Data) to get all the attendance objects for that particular day.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","observer-pattern","addobserver"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13216144,"title":"Unregistering observers of a object during object deallocation","body":"<p>Not sure I am asking this right but I'll give it a try anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have a program which invokes this little bit of code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>[localCalculateTimeFiles addObserver:self\n       forKeyPath:@\"arraystatuscounter\"\n          options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew\n          context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Eventually localCalculateTimeFiles goes away and I'd like to removeObserver the current bit of code (to put it crudely).

The \"Shift\" entities are kept together by another NSManagedObject called \"ShiftRotation\" which has a many-to-one relationship to the \"Shifts\".</p>\n\n<p>My app was working properly until recently, when I made few changes to how I was using these \"Shift\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is this. The user associates a \"Shift\" to a date. The date is stored inside a \"date\" property within the \"Shift\" NSManagedObject. The context is saved. When I access the \"Shift\" later, without making any changes, the date that was assigned to the \"Shift\" appears changed.</p>\n\n<p>I went through my code line by line and added numerous NSLogs to see where or why it's changing, with no results. I noticed that there is no change to the date immediately before AND after I save the context within the class where the save is occurring. There's also no change when I access it from the main Calendar screen. However when I later retrieve the \"Shifts\" from another screen where I manage all shift rotations, they appear to have changed.</p>\n\n<p>The date change is approximately 31 to 32 days in the future. I can't help but wonder if this is a bug in Core Data or I'm a missing something.</p>\n\n<p>Any explanation or reason why accessing a date from a sqlite persistent store causes a significant and unpredictable date change?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried to further narrow down what was happening and where it was happening by using NSNotificationCenter.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using iOS 6.</p>\n\n<p>I registered the root view controller to observe any changes to the managed object context. Particularly any changes to the Objects (i.e. NSManagedObjectContextObjectDidChange).</p>\n\n<p>After I updated the properties of the \"Shift\" NSManagedObject I receive a notification indicating that the \"Shift\" object was updated. Here's some code and logs.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the \"Shift\" entity is created and given a date:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (NSMutableArray *)arrayWithDateStartingAtDate:(NSDate *)anyDate forNumberOfDays:(NSUInteger)days;\n{\n    NSCalendar *gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];\n    NSMutableArray *monthArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n    NSDateComponents *comps = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];\n    NSDate *tempDate;\n\n    NSManagedObjectContext *moc = [[CSEventStore sharedStore] managedObjectContext];\n\n    for (NSUInteger i = 0; i &lt; days; i++) {\n        [comps setDay:i];\n        tempDate = [gregorian dateByAddingComponents:comps toDate:anyDate options:0];\n        Shift *shiftRDO = [Shift initShiftEntityRDOWithDate:tempDate InContext:moc];\n        [shiftRDO setShiftRotation:_shiftRotation];\n\n        NSMutableDictionary *dateDict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:tempDate, @\"date\", shiftRDO, @\"shift\", nil];\n        [monthArray addObject:dateDict];\n    }\n\n    return monthArray;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is where the call is made to update it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[shiftEntity updateWithShiftType:_selectedShiftType inContext:context];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which calls the method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)updateWithShiftType:(ShiftType *)shiftType inContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context\n{\n    self.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\",shiftType.title];\n    self.symbol = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\",shiftType.symbol];\n    self.startTime = [shiftType.startTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.endTime = [shiftType.endTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.splitStartTime = [shiftType.splitStartTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.splitEndTime = [shiftType.splitEndTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.isWorkday = [shiftType.isWorkday copy];\n    self.isTimeOff = [shiftType.isTimeOff copy];\n    self.typeID = [shiftType typeID];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the above code executes, the first notification is posted in the log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Shift: 0x8140b70&gt; (entity: Shift; id: 0x81409e0 &lt;x-coredata:///Shift/tE59A199A-444E-4079-BD8C-0D3E734607783&gt; ; data: {\ndate = \"2012-10-29 04:00:00 +0000\";\nendTime = \"2012-11-02 19:35:38 +0000\";\nisTimeOff = 0;\nisWorkday = 1;\nshiftRotation = \"0x81406a0 &lt;x-coredata:///ShiftRotation/tE59A199A-444E-4079-BD8C-0D3E734607782&gt;\";\nsplitEndTime = nil;\nsplitStartTime = nil;\nstartTime = \"2012-11-02 09:35:34 +0000\";\nsymbol = none;\ntitle = Days;\ntypeID = \"991ACC8C-ECE0-4555-9002-7AC233F26CBF\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The \"<strong>date</strong>\" property does have the proper assigned date.</p>\n\n<p>Now as soon as I save the context with the following method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (BOOL)saveContext\n{\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    if (__managedObjectContext) {\n        if ([__managedObjectContext hasChanges] &amp;&amp; ![__managedObjectContext save:&amp;error]) {\n            NSLog(@\"Unresolved error %@, %@\", error, [error userInfo]);\n\n            // More details on error\n            NSArray* detailedErrors = [error userInfo][NSDetailedErrorsKey];\n            if(detailedErrors != nil &amp;&amp; [detailedErrors count] &gt; 0) {\n                for(NSError* detailedError in detailedErrors) {\n                    NSLog(@\"  DetailedError: %@\", [detailedError userInfo]);\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                NSLog(@\"  %@\", [error userInfo]);\n            }\n\n            return NO;\n            abort();\n        }\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I receive a second notification of a change with the following log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;Shift: 0x8140b70&gt; (entity: Shift; id: 0x82c9dd0 &lt;x-coredata://7CE834F9-5056-457A-BB2C-B8BA638086F1/Shift/p23&gt; ; data: {\n    date = \"2012-12-02 05:00:00 +0000\";\n    endTime = \"2012-11-02 19:35:38 +0000\";\n    isTimeOff = 0;\n    isWorkday = 1;\n    shiftRotation = \"0x8260dc0 &lt;x-coredata://7CE834F9-5056-457A-BB2C-B8BA638086F1/ShiftRotation/p11&gt;\";\n    splitEndTime = nil;\n    splitStartTime = nil;\n    startTime = \"2012-11-02 09:35:34 +0000\";\n    symbol = none;\n    title = Days;\n    typeID = \"991ACC8C-ECE0-4555-9002-7AC233F26CBF\";\n}),\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you notice, the \"<strong>date</strong>\" changed to 2012-12-02, just by saving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was finally able to track the cause of the unexplained change. It seems that I was inadvertently changing the \"date\" property after I was saving the context somewhere else in my code. Perhaps that would have not happened if I had followed carmin's convention (I would have given +1 if I had the reputation). The value was not changing in the Persistent store after all.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sharing how I tracked down this bug might benefit anyone else that might have similar problems, not necessarily related to Core Data. </p>\n\n<p>I used Key Value Observing, to observe the \"date\" property. I began observing immediately after creating the \"Shift\" entity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity addObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and stopped observing after a point in my code where the change had already occurred:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then implemented the KVO method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Object being observed: %@\", [object description]);\n    NSLog(@\"Value changed to: %@\", change[NSKeyValueChangeNewKey]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed a break point at the above method. When the change occurred, it stopped at this point, and told me what had change. Most importantly, when the code stopped executing, I looked at the call stack, and traced my way back through the path that the code took that caused the change. I was able to find exactly where my code was making the change.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have much knowledge using KVO but this experience showed me its usefulness even for debugging purposes.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","iphone-sdk-4.0","core-location"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":13204823,"title":"didUpdateToLocation stop call [solved]","body":"<p>the method - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation; \ncall 1 or 2 times and never more...Why?</p>\n\n<pre><code> -(void) startLocation {\n if (locationManager == nil)\n    locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];\n\nlocationManager.delegate = self;\nlocationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters;\nlocationManager.distanceFilter = 10;\n\n[locationManager startUpdatingLocation];\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and : </p>\n\n<pre><code>       - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation {\ncontadorSegundos++;\nfloat diferencaLatitude = 0;\nfloat diferencaLongitude = 0;\nNSLog(@\"old latitude: %f\", oldLocation.coordinate.latitude);\nNSLog(@\"old longitude: %f\", oldLocation.coordinate.longitude);\n\n\nNSLog(@\"new longitude: %f\", newLocation.coordinate.longitude);\nNSLog(@\"old latitude: %f\", newLocation.coordinate.latitude);\n\nif(oldLocation) {\nif(oldLocation.coordinate.latitude &gt; newLocation.coordinate.latitude)\n    diferencaLatitude = oldLocation.coordinate.latitude - newLocation.coordinate.latitude;\nelse if(newLocation.coordinate.latitude &gt; oldLocation.coordinate.latitude)\n    diferencaLatitude = newLocation.coordinate.latitude - oldLocation.coordinate.latitude;\n}\n\nif (oldLocation) {\n\nif(oldLocation.coordinate.longitude &gt; newLocation.coordinate.longitude)\n    diferencaLongitude = oldLocation.coordinate.longitude - newLocation.coordinate.longitude;\nelse if(newLocation.coordinate.longitude &gt; oldLocation.coordinate.longitude)\n    diferencaLongitude = newLocation.coordinate.longitude - oldLocation.coordinate.longitude;\n}\n\n//NSLog(@\"dif lat %f\", diferencaLatitude);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>// NSLog(@\"dif long %f\", diferencaLongitude);</p>\n\n<pre><code>CLLocationCoordinate2D coord;\nif ((diferencaLatitude &gt; 1) || (diferencaLongitude &gt; 1)) {\n    _emMovimento = YES;\n    NSLog(@\"em movimento\");\n}\nelse {\n    if(contadorSegundos &gt; 10) {\n    _emMovimento = NO;\n    contadorSegundos = 0;\n        NSLog(@\"parado\");\n    }\n}\n\ncoord.longitude = newLocation.coordinate.longitude;\ncoord.latitude = newLocation.coordinate.latitude;\n_latitude = coord.latitude;\n_longitude = coord.longitude;\n\nNSLog(@\"latitude: %f\", _latitude);\nNSLog(@\"longitude: %f\", _longitude);\nMKReverseGeocoder *geocoder = [[MKReverseGeocoder alloc] initWithCoordinate:coord];\n[geocoder setDelegate:self];\n[geocoder start];\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","math"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":13202964,"title":"Convert double decimal to Hex, Binary and Octal strings","body":"<p>Is there a custom or standard library that I can use with objective c to convert a decimal floating point value into Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal NSStrings?</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking around a lot but can only find how to convert the other direction (from everything else into decimal), by using: <code>double result = (double)strtoll(myHexString.UTF8String, NULL,16)</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","nsdictionary","nstableview"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":13213273,"title":"Presenting NSDictionary in UITableView","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11745233/nsdictionary-to-uitableview\">NSDictionary to UITableView</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NSDictionary with keys, for example, @\"first_name\".

Thus, in certain cases, I'd rather use 2&sigma; (<code>2*horizontalAccuracy</code>) or even 3&sigma; (<code>3*horizontalAccuracy</code>) to calculate with.</p>\n\n<p>To put it short: is there any indication somewhere, which confidence interval <code>horizontalAccuracy</code> has?</p>\n\n<p>Comment to all who respond \"Apple says it is within\":\nWell - the measurement can not be exact. It must have a certain level of uncertainty. If you repeat the measurement very often, you will get a distribution of results - probably a gaussian distribution. This gaussian has a certain width, which corresponds to the level of uncertainty of the measurements. Measuring the position more often will reduce the uncertainty and thus increase accuracy, but never will give you a distinct interval where the actual position is guaranteed to be in. You will only get a probability. But if the accuracy is 3sigma, we have 99,7% - which is close to certain. \nTo put it short - I doubt the documentation from Apple.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ftp","nsstream"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":102,"score":1,"question_id":12845158,"title":"NSStream don't send all data","body":"<p>My case is quite strange:\nI practically used the example \"SimpleFTPSample\" (some small variation of the type [self.networkStream setProperty: (id) kCFBooleanFalse forKey: (NSString *) kCFStreamPropertyFTPAttemptPersistentConnection]; to avoid keeping the connection alive WiFi/3G) to perform transfer operations FTP file but despite not having errors of any kind, your downloaded file is corrupted if you use an ftp site: To resolve this issue, simply add a sleep (3)!

All students are users. In the database (django-ORM based), this is represented as a <code>Student</code> table with a foreign-key to the <code>User</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create a REST API, and an object hierarchy in the iOS app that models this API. I'm having trouble deciding how to model this.</p>\n\n<h1>The Current Solution</h1>\n\n<p>The best I've come up with is this: Have a <code>User</code> model in iOS, have a <code>Student</code> model in iOS which inherits from <code>User</code> and extends it with more properties. Then, have a method which receives a JSON response from the server, and creates <em>either</em> a <code>User</code> or a <code>Student</code> model, depending on the dictinoary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the server will need to always give me the most specific type. I.e., when I log in to the server, it will decide whether I'm a student or just a regular user, and will return me the proper dictionary.</p>\n\n<h1>Is this the best way?</h1>\n\n<p>This sounds a little complicated. But any other way I've thought of modeling it, e.g. changing the way the database is laid out, gives me a design in which the database isn't aware of all the constraints. For example, <code>Student</code> objects are allowed to own other objects (e..g, <code>homework_paper</code>). I can model this with a foreign key to a <code>User</code> object instead of to the <code>Student</code> object, and say that the <code>Student</code> is simply an extension of the user. But then the database doesn't force the fact that a <code>homework_paper</code> has to be owned by a student. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to solve this problem that I'm missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","ipad"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13210702,"title":"add subview and setting frame causing code to lag","body":"<p>I have the following code:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xmvMU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9Ihm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to optimize the code, for some reason <code>initWithRootViewController,  [self.view addSubview:fullStory.view];,</code> \n and setting the frame to the view's superframe is the biggest performance hurdle.

With the design I have to implement, I cannot just use the default navigation bar</li>\n<li>works well with the UINavigationController; when the user taps the \"back\" button, the main view controller (with the button bar) should stay, but the child view controller representing the actual scene content should go back to the previous scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem currently is that the \"back\" button won't change the child controller--it changes the parent controller, returning to the previous scene before the scene with the button bars. I've tried this several different ways. I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right, or if it can't be done.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is to implement my own \"back\" functionality, keeping a stack of child view controllers and manually changing them when the user taps \"back.\" This is awkward, however, and poor design compared to using UINavigationController.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I am going the wrong way with this. I can't accept duplicating the button bar across every single scene in Interface Builder... but perhaps I should create it programmatically, and then I can easily call that code from each and every scene. Then I would have \"normal\" view controllers, and using UINavigationController would be easier. But before I go that route and completely scrap what I have so far, I wanted to see if there was another way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an overview of some parts of my solution:</p>\n\n<p>I created a ButtonBarController, laying out the Storyboard with a UIView for the buttons I wanted, and a UIView for the content pane. I also layered a button with the app logo (to go to the app's main screen) on top of a back button.</p>\n\n<p>Then I created a controller for each of those other screens. In those subscreens/child view controllers, I would first add a UIView at the correct size to fit in my content pane, and then would add all the other controls I wanted. I had all of those child view controllers inherit from another controller, which took care of a few common tasks--such as procuring a reference to the button bar controller, and code to help resize the views for 3.5\" versus 4\" screens.</p>\n\n<p>I created a changeToControllerWithIndex method; I call this when the app loads, when the user clicks one of the buttons in the main button bar to change scenes, or when anything happens in a scene requiring another scene change. I overload this method to provide two additional pieces of information: providing an NSDictionary with any extra information the child view controller needs, and to tell it whether this is a top-level scene, or whether we need a back button.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: it's important to set the Storyboard ID for those child view controllers in the Identity Inspector. I kept accidentally setting the Title in the Attribute Inspector instead)</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    [self changeToControllerWithIndex:index withPayload:nil isRootView:YES];\n}\n\n// This is the method that will change the active view controller and the view that is shown\n- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload isRootView:(BOOL)isRootView\n{\n    if (YES) {\n        self.index = index;\n\n        // The code below will properly remove the the child view controller that is\n        // currently being shown to the user and insert the new child view controller.\n        UIViewController *vc = [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:payload];\n\n        if (isRootView) {\n            NSLog(@\"putting navigation controller in\");\n            childNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n            [childNavigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];\n            [self addChildViewController:childNavigationController];\n            [childNavigationController didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n\n            if (self.currentViewController){\n                [self.currentViewController willMoveToParentViewController:nil];\n\n                [self transitionFromViewController:self.currentViewController toViewController:childNavigationController duration:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^{\n                    [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];\n                } completion:^(BOOL finished) {\n                    [self.currentViewController removeFromParentViewController];\n                    self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n                }];\n            } else {\n                [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n                self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n            }\n\n            [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n\n            //We are at the root of the navigation path, so no back button for us\n            [homeButton setHidden:NO];\n            [backButton setHidden:YES];\n        } else {\n            //Not a root view -- we're in navigation and want a back button\n\n            [childNavigationController pushViewController:vc animated:NO];\n\n            [homeButton setHidden:YES];\n            [backButton setHidden:NO];\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have an overloaded method to set up each individual view controller... some require a little more preparation than others.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    return [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:nil];\n}\n\n// This is where you instantiate each child controller and setup anything you need  on them, like delegates and public properties.\n- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload {\n    UIViewController *vc = nil;\n    if (index == CONTROLLER_HOME){\n        vc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Home\"];\n    } else if (index == CONTROLLER_CATEGORIES){\n        SAVECategoryViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Categories\"];\n        if (payload) {\n            child.currentCategory = [(NSNumber *) [(NSDictionary *)payload objectForKey:ATTRIBUTE_CAT_ID] integerValue];\n        } else {\n            child.currentCategory = CATEGORY_ALL;\n        }\n        vc = child;\n    } //etc for all the other controllers...\n    payload = nil;\n\n    return vc;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I mentioned my difficulty with managing the \"back\" navigation.

Using 'get_main_queue' results in a dead-lock, as announced in the Apple docs.

It has a delegate set to the RootView Controller, so all the incoming data gets sent to the object after setDelegate, in this case RootViewController.</p>\n\n<p><code>[[TGAccessoryManager sharedTGAccessoryManager] setDelegate:(RootViewController *)[[navigationController viewControllers] objectAtIndex:0]];</code></p>\n\n<p>My question is: How do I change this functionality to call one of my javascript functions instead of a native object like RootViewController? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here are some hints, from the biosensor manufacturer's iOS\n  documentation:</p>\n  \n  <p>The delegate can be set to any class that implements the\n  TGAccessoryDelegate protocol — in this case, it's an instance of\n  RootViewController.</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the delegate object was set to be a RootViewController instance,\n  we have to edit its class defnition to indicate support of the\n  TGAccessoryDelegate protocol. In the sample project file, the class\n  definition in RootViewController.h looks similar to the following:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>@interface RootViewController : UITableViewController</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Simply modify the definition in the following way:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>@interface RootViewController : UITableViewController &lt;TGAccessoryDelegate&gt;</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a requisite of supporting the TGAccessoryDelegate protocol, the\n  dataRecieved: method must be implemented. In the header (.h) file, add\n  the following method definition:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>- (void)dataReceived:(NSDictionary *)data;</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And in the implementation (.m) filele, implement the method. A few\n  NSLog calls are provided as a trivial example of accessing the data\n  parameter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>- (void)dataReceived:(NSDictionary *)data { NSLog(@\"Data received!\"); NSLog(@\"Raw: %d\", [[data valueForKey:@\"raw\"] intValue]); NSLog(@\"Attention: %d\", [[data valueForKey:@\"eSenseAttention\"] intValue]); }</code></p>\n\n<p>So, this documentation seems really clear. But I'm not sure how to proceed, and I'm not sure how to use setDelegate (or even if I should) since I want to writeJavascript text back to the UIWebview with the data from the biosensor. (See Step 7 at the link above for the point where I think things might need to be edited.)</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ipad","uitableview","uitableviewcell","storyboard"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13185753,"title":"Transition to a view in table with dynamic cells","body":"<p>I create tableview and I fill the table dynamic data.</p>\n\n<p>How to create transition between cell and another view.</p>\n\n<p>Сells are filled with the names of files in the folder documents.</p>\n\n<p>I use storyboard.</p>\n\n<p>App for iPad.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","nsdate"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10829,"score":5,"question_id":6112075,"title":"IOS: compare two dates","body":"<p>I have a NSDate that I must compare with other two NSDate and I try with NSOrderAscending and NSOrderDescending but if my date is equal at other two dates?</p>\n\n<p>exmaple: if I have a myDate = 24/05/2011   and other two that are one = 24/05/2011 and two 24/05/2011 what can I use?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":885,"score":2,"question_id":10935638,"title":"IOS [NSURL initFileURLWithPath:]: nil string parameter on loading video","body":"<p>I have a problem with my video content.

NewClass.h is in the exact same location as OldClass.h, the framework compiles with no errors, I've made sure to clean out any old artifacts, and I've verified that in the framework's target I've included NewClass.h in the \"Copy Headers\" build phase.</p>\n\n<p>What additional step is required to make a framework's header files available to users of the framework?</p>\n\n<p>p.s. I realize that I should likely have a single MyFramework.h for anyone wanting to use the framework, but I'll tackle that once I've figured out how to add new headers!</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","xcode","uiscrollview"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":13157728,"title":"Strange Behaviour of UIScrollview","body":"<p>I need to draw dynamic images on <code>UIScrollView</code> for this i use, <code>MKHorizion</code> menu (A subclass of Scroll view).

This is the intended behavior.  </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're on element 1 of the pickerView.  If you scroll to element 0 (by dragging the component downwards)...and go past it (dragging the 0 element far down the picker view beyond the blue selection box)...when you let go, the pickerView will scroll back to element 0 in order to center it back in the blue selection box, and then call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we take the same example...(ie you're on element 1 of the pickerView, and scroll far beyond element 0)...if the pickerView is in the middle of scrolling back to element 0, and you quickly click element 0 or the white space above it, then the pickerView will awkwardly \"jump\" from wherever it is in the scroll animation straight to element 0, and then WON'T call didSelectRow.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big issue, as we are now on element 0 without actually calling didSelectRow...thus, we have no indication that we are no longer on element 1.  Furthermore, this also happens if you scroll beyond the final element and quickly tap the final element or the white space below it, before the scroll animation is finished.

When I switch from any of them to the one in the middle, I want to have a UIActionSheet pop up and give two options and a cancel button. In my test app I added code in viewWillAppear to bring up the sheet so that the user can select which option they want and the view associated with that button will change based on the user's selection.

However, the touch on view2 objects was just working fine. The error on crashing (when objects are touched in view1) was <strong>glerunvertexsubmitARM</strong> . On some research, I found the error has to do with incorrect veretx or index buffer being bound. So I checked my bufferIndex and vertexIndex for my objects. After initialisation of my first view, the handles for my vertexbuffer and index buffer generated were again starting from index 1. \nBased on my understanding, EAGLcontext was responsible for this. So now when I generate new EAGLContext for my view2, I init it with the same EAGLsharegroup. This stopped my app from crashing anymore and also I see the handles for second view do not start with 1. Based on my understanding of EAGLSharegroup, it is responsible for sharing resources like vertex and index buffer objects. (VBO and IBO is all what I need here which stopped my app from crashing)</p>\n\n<p>But I am not able to detect touches on my views effeciently at all. <strong>It does not read any pixel a lot of times but sometimes it would read</strong>.\nIf I do not touch the first view, touch on second view is perfectly fine.\nI am not sure other than sharing the same EAGLsharegroup, what else is required to do.\nI am posting my code below.</p>\n\n<p>Also when I work with just one view, everything works smooth and fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Touch detection</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>-(NSNumber*)findBarbyPoint:(CGPoint)point {\n\n\n\nNSInteger height = ((GLKView *)self.view).drawableHeight;\nNSInteger width = ((GLKView *)self.view).drawableWidth;\n\nGLubyte *pixelColor = (GLubyte*)malloc(4*sizeof(GLubyte)*1*1);\n\nint k = 4*1*1;\n\nGLuint colorRenderbuffer;\nGLuint framebuffer;\n\nglGenFramebuffers(1, &amp;framebuffer);\nglBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, framebuffer);\nglGenRenderbuffers(1, &amp;colorRenderbuffer);\nglBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, colorRenderbuffer);\n\nglRenderbufferStorage(GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_RGBA8_OES, width, height);\nglFramebufferRenderbuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER,  colorRenderbuffer);\n\nGLenum status = glCheckFramebufferStatus(GL_FRAMEBUFFER);\nif (status != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE) {\n    NSLog(@\"Framebuffer status: %x\", (int)status);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nglClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n\nglClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);\n\nself.effect.transform.projectionMatrix = ProjectionMatrix;\n//can be in a different function\n\nfor(int i=0;

The weird thing is that it seems to work completely fine on my iOS simulator (i.e., I can add an entry to an array, and that entry shows up in my table view). However, when I try to add an entry when using my iOS device, the codes breaks on the line <code>dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:</code>. I've checked for capitalization inconsistencies, name inconsistencies, have reimplemented <code>prepareForReuse</code> in the custom UITableViewCell subclass, have tried defining fields in my UITableViewCell subclass using IBOutlets v. tags, and perhaps a few more things but none have worked.</p>\n\n<p>This questions is tangentially related to my previous question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13043741/debugging-strategies-when-uitableviews-cells-dont-load\">Debugging strategies when UITableView&#39;s cells don&#39;t load?</a></p>\n\n<p>The tough part about programming is always knowing which question to ask, so I apologize if it turns out I am asking the wrong questions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 6: Problem Is Custom Layout For UITableViewCell On iOS 5</strong></p>\n\n<p>I tested using a subclass of UITableViewCell and UITableViewCell with a custom layout. Using a subclass of UITableViewCell with style UITableViewCellStyleDefault <strong><em>does</em></strong> work on both iOS 5 and iOS 6 iPhone simulator. However, using a generic UITableViewCell with a custom style <strong><em>crashes on iOS 5 but not iOS 6</em></strong>. Interestingly, I don't see a declaration for a custom UITableViewCellStyle in the documentation for UITableViewCell...</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 5: iOS 5 v. 6 + Custom UITableViewCell Subclass?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hello: Continued testing today and it appears that it is an issue between how iOS 5 and 6 treat custom UITableViewCell subclasses. No solution yet :(</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4: iOS 5 v. iOS 6?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So all I've been able to notice is that this seems to be an issue with iOS 5 versus iOS 6. When testing on iOS 6 using line <code>GlassboxCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier]</code> the code below works. However, neither that line nor <code>GlassboxCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier forIndexPath:indexPath]</code> work in iOS 5. Any ideas? I somehow got it to work exactly once by changing the identifier to <code>protocell</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3: I now use GitHub!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/kenmhaggerty/Glassbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kenmhaggerty/Glassbox</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2: More Observations</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I had added in <code>@synthesize tableView = _tableView</code> because I read in a response somewhere that it might help, but I now realize that it stopped my data from loading in my table view even when running on the iOS simulator. Commenting out that line of code returns the code back to how I describe it above: it works just fine on the iOS simulator but breaks on line <code>dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:</code> with no specified error, just <code>Thread 1: breakpoint 1.1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 1: Relevant Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>GlassboxTableViewController.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n//  GlassboxTableViewController.h\n//  Glassbox\n//\n//  Created by Ken M.

When the app is attached and running in the debugger, there is no debug output to say why like with a 'normal' crash. I know it happens after a LoadView  because an NSLog at the end of LoadView is the last output, on the <strong>same</strong> screen every time. Below is the limited crash report form Organizer ('unknown' process I think because it was running in the debugger?)  This has only started happening on ios6. There are apparently no memory leaks according to the instrument though I'm not sure I entirely trust it. The crash tends to happen when you play the game for a while and go back and forth through the screens so it feels like a leak. However the fact it is always when returning to the same screen suggests it's a problem with that view controller. I don't know what rpages is exactly and I don't know if 90974 is too big.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Incident Identifier: 7D34217C-9F8E-49B0-B399-1F5573355F31\nCrashReporter Key:   29ce6ea76874d5a03d826014a1f50e1a2160db41\nHardware Model:      iPhone3,1\nOS Version:          iPhone OS 6.0 (10A403)\nKernel Version:      Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Sun Aug 19 00:27:34 PDT 2012;
