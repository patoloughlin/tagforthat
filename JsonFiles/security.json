After every authentication attempt made by the cookie, delete the row that uses the old uniqueid and, if the authentication was successful, generate a new random token.

The expiration date will be stored in the same database table that stores uniqueid and tokens. Every time a new cookie is created, this expiration will be sent with the cookie. If a user tries logging in with a cookie that the server deems expired but the client still holds, the log in will be denied.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this solution is reasonably secure, but are there any pitfalls or things that I have overlooked when I designed this method?</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/8508213/444402\">Hash token in database</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/7591897/444402\">Don't store account name in cookies and use new unique id after every authentication</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["php","security"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":13262185,"title":"MD5 the id in URL and get the id to other page using PHP","body":"<p>Suppose that I have code as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"view_edit_form.php?id=&lt;?php echo md5($row[0]);?&gt;\"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in page <code>view_edit_form.php</code> I get the id by using this code <code>$ID = $_GET['id'];</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can not get the <code>id</code> if I <code>md5</code> it like this.Anyone help me please, Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","security","ubuntu","kernel","kill"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":1,"question_id":13261277,"title":"Secure method for killing a process and all offspring","body":"<p>I am creating a sandbox environment in Linux using <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man2/aa_change_profile.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparmor</a>, <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man2/setrlimit.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">setrlimit</a>, <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man3/cap_set_proc.3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cap_set_rpoc</a> to let anonymous users basically execute some arbitrary code on my server in the context of a scientific application.

I created a custom AuthenticationProvider and implemented the <code>authenticate()</code> method like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {\n    UserProfile profile = userProfileService.findByEmail(authentication.getPrincipal().toString());\n\n    if(profile == null){\n        throw new UsernameNotFoundException(String.format(\"Invalid credentials\", authentication.getPrincipal()));\n    }\n\n    String suppliedPasswordHash = DigestUtils.shaHex(authentication.getCredentials().toString());\n\n    if(!profile.getPasswordHash().equals(suppliedPasswordHash)){\n        throw new BadCredentialsException(\"Invalid credentials\");\n    }\n\n    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken token = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(profile, null, profile.getAuthorities());\n\n    return token;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>profile.getAuthorities()</code> method creates a list of Rights (rights are wrapped in my own implementation of GrantedAuthority).

How would I accomplish this? And what is the difference between a ROLE and a PERMISSION in Spring?

These functions may depend on the client-id.</p>\n\n<p>There's two approaches that I have come up with that might do this, but I am hoping for something simpler that requires less traffic and less server load:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"No-brainer\": The clients hash the password. The clients and server each use a standard mechanism (like SSL) to secure their connection and send the hash over this connection.</p></li>\n<li><p>\"A little more clever\": The server has a fixed private-key coded into it and each client has the public-key coded into it. The clients hash the password, XOR it with their client-id, encrypt the result with RSA/PGP using the public key. The server then decrypts the request using the private key and XORs the result with the client-id to arrive at the password hash.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In both cases, the server ends up with the same secret for the clients: the password hash. The advantage of the second version is that there is no need for the overhead of a full-fledged key exchange and encryption system, since unfortunately I won't be able to rely on SSL in all cases. In fact, it allows me to generate the server secret in a single request without any handshake. The client-id-XOR in the second version are used to prevent replay-attacks, where a third party with a different client-id could otherwise simply send the same encrypted message to the server to generate the same secret. Basically it's a no-overhead way to add a salt.</p>\n\n<p>Now the question:</p>\n\n<p>Since I don't really have any requirements on the server-side secret, not even that the clients can generate this secret locally, <strong>is there an even simpler way to do this</strong> that doesn't require expensive modular exponentiation of arbitrary-precision numbers like RSA does? I'm thinking of maybe some sort of other trapdoor function for f() and g() above that allows me to achieve the same result.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","security","api","rest","hmac"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":65,"score":0,"question_id":13235898,"title":"How do I restrict access to an API signature generator in PHP?","body":"<p>When using an HMAC signature for authenticating REST API calls, how can I prevent someone from  creating their own useable signature by manually calling the script that generates the signature?</p>\n\n<p>For example, if an AJAX request is used to retrieve a signature that will be appended to a CORS Ajax request to the API, the possibility exists that someone can create their own signature by passing the appropriate values/headers.</p>\n\n<p>I know that I could use <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> or <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST']</code> to add some layer of security, but these can be spoofed.</p>\n\n<p>Please assume that I'll be using SSL for all connections, and that I know about OAuth but will not be using it here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","security","postgresql"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":3,"question_id":13235664,"title":"Is this PostgreSQL query vulnerable?","body":"<p>Using the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-escape-literal.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">pg_escape_literal</a> PHP function, I'm escaping my user input data as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;?php\n  $dbconn = pg_connect('dbname=foo');\n  $escaped = pg_escape_literal($_GET['name']);\n  pg_query(\"INSERT INTO participants (name) VALUES ({$escaped})\");\n  ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Being new to PostgreSQL, my questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a way to achieve an SQL injection given this code?</li>\n<li>Is there any other vulnerability that is left untreated in this code?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using PHP 5.4 and PostgreSQL 9.2. </p>\n"},{"tags":["django","security"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":7714979,"title":"How to avoid sensitive information in POSTs from appearing in logs and debug emails?","body":"<p>One of my websites has a form for customers to submit their credit card information.</p>\n\n<p>Under normal operation the sensitive information (credit card number, expiration date, etc) is fairly secured due to the SSL of the connection and the fact that the data may not be saved on the backend after the charging attempt.</p>\n\n<p>The problem starts whenever an exception is raised by the backend code handling the request, since the exception details (which with Django include the POST QueryDict) contain the sensitive info in plain text.

Just as described <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1571183/808723\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1.exchange some form of a private/public key pair; the server generates a key pair and keeps the private key to itself and shares the public key with the client (e.g. over a WCF message, for instance)</p>\n  \n  <p>2.using that private/public key pair, exchange a common shared secret, e.g. an \"encryption key\" that will symmetrically encrypt your messages (and since it's symmetrical, the server can use the same key to decrypt the messages)</p>\n  \n  <p>3.setup infrastructure on your client (e.g. a WCF extension called a behavior) to inspect the message before it goes out and encrypt it with your shared secret</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That would be secure, wouldn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any existing solution to archive what I described? If not I'll create it on my own. Where do I start best? Which kind of WCF custom behaviour is the best to implement?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nAs this is NOT secure, I'll take the following approach:</p>\n\n<p>When Installing the server component a new X509 certificate will be generated and automatially added to the cert store (of the server). The public part of this generated certificate will be dynamically included into the client setup. When running the client setup on the client machine the certificate will be installed into the trustet windows certificate store of the client.</p>\n\n<p>So there's no extra work when installing the product and everything should be secure, just as we want it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","security","asp.net-webforms","rijndaelmanaged"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":13177605,"title":"Asp.net code not working for implementing rijndael encryption, decryption?","body":"<p>I'm reading a book entitled beginning asp.net security from wrox and I'm in this part where it shows a code snippet for using rijndael the problem this example is not included in the downloadable source codes.

The products I work on use something like a user name or phone number to salt the hash.  Essentially something that is different for each user but is readily available to us.  The other product randomly generates a salt for each user and changes each time the user changes the password.  The salt is then encrypted in the database.</p>\n\n<p>My question is if the second approach is really necessary?  I can understand from a purely theoretical perspective that it is more secure than the first approach, but what about from a practicality point of view.  Right now to authenticate a user, the salt must be unencrypted and applied to the login information.  </p>\n\n<p>After thinking about it, I just don't see a real security gain from this approach.  Changing the salt from account to account, still makes it extremely difficult for someone to attempt to brute force the hashing algorithm even if the attacker was aware of how to quickly determine what it was for each account.  This is going on the assumption that the  passwords are sufficiently strong.  (Obviously finding the correct hash for a set of passwords where they are all two digits is significantly easier than finding the correct hash of passwords which are 8 digits).  Am I incorrect in my logic, or is there something that I am missing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Okay so here's the reason why I think it's really moot to encrypt the salt.  (lemme know if I'm on the right track).  </p>\n\n<p>For the following explanation, we'll assume that the passwords are always 8 characters and the salt is 5 and all passwords are comprised of lowercase letters (it just makes the math easier).</p>\n\n<p>Having a different salt for each entry means that I can't use the same rainbow table (actually technically I could if I had one of sufficient size, but let's ignore that for the moment).  This is the real key to the salt from what I understand, because to crack every account I have to reinvent the wheel so to speak for each one.  Now if I know how to apply the correct salt to a password to generate the hash, I'd do it because a salt really just extends the length/complexity of the hashed phrase.  So I would be cutting the number of possible combinations I would need to generate to \"know\" I have the password + salt from 13^26 to 8^26 because I know what the salt is.  Now that makes it easier, but still really hard.  </p>\n\n<p>So onto encrypting the salt.  If I know the salt is encrypted, I wouldn't try and decrypt (assuming I know it has a sufficient level of encryption) it first.  I would ignore it.  Instead of trying to figure out how to decrypt it, going back to the previous example I would just generate a larger rainbow table containing all keys for the 13^26.  Not knowing the salt would definitely slow me down, but I don't think it would add the monumental task of trying to crack the salt encryption first.  That's why I don't think it's worth it.

However, when we use the third party's iPads, almost every single time, Facebook initiates an unregistered device issue and forces the captcha + Photo Verification/ID process in order to complete the login process.</p>\n\n<p>I did a variety of tests that ensured this was in no way related to a) our ISP/IP; b) our Facebook app c) incorrect credentials being entered; d) individual account security settings. The jist of those tests centered around using the same account on one of my company's iPads, then one of the third party's iPads. I've narrowed it down to being a local device setting, I think. However, I did not have time to go through the iPad + Safari settings such as private browsing etc.</p>\n\n<p>As a QA person, I am fully aware that my next step would have been to compare the settings of our functional iPads to theirs which end up with the verification issue. That being said, all the equipment had to be packed up and sent on the road before I could complete my testing.</p>\n\n<p>So, if anyone has specific experience related to this sort of issue (Facebook login verification) I'd really appreciate any tips that you can provide to make sure users are not prompted for excessive security verifications, as it slows down our registration process in an unacceptable manner.</p>\n\n<p>Kindly, Dave</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","svg"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":2,"question_id":13054510,"title":"Does Inkscape's --vacuum-defs make SVGs truly safe?","body":"<p>We are considering allowing user uploaded SVGs in our web app. We've been hesitant to do this before, due to a large number of complex vulnerabilities that we know exist in untrusted SVGs.

Rainbow tables are more complex creatures, and are actually a variant of Hellman Hash Chains. Though I believe the answer is still the same (since it doesnt come down to cryptanalysis), some of the discussion might be a bit skewed.<br>\nThe question: \"<a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/q/379/33\">What are rainbow tables and how are they used?</a>\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Typically, I always recommend using a cryptographically-strong random value as salt, to be used with hash functions (e.g. for passwords), such as to protect against Rainbow Table attacks.  </p>\n\n<p>But is it actually cryptographically necessary for the salt to be random? Would any unique value (unique per user, e.g. userId) suffice in this regard? It would in fact prevent using a single Rainbow Table to crack all (or most) passwords in the system...<br>\nBut does lack of entropy really weaken the cryptographic strength of the hash functions?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note, I am not asking about why to use salt, how to protect it (it doesnt need to be), using a single constant hash (don't), or what kind of hash function to use.<br>\nJust whether salt needs entropy or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks all for the answers so far, but I'd like to focus on the areas I'm (a little) less familiar with. Mainly implications for cryptanalysis - I'd appreciate most if anyone has some input from the crypto-mathematical PoV.<br>\nAlso, if there are additional vectors that hadn't been considered, thats great input too (see @Dave Sherohman point on multiple systems).<br>\nBeyond that, if you have any theory, idea or best practice - please back this up either with proof, attack scenario, or empirical evidence. Or even valid considerations for acceptable trade-offs... I'm familiar with Best Practice (capital B capital P) on the subject, I'd like to prove what value this actually provides.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: Some really good answers here, but I think as @Dave says, it comes down to Rainbow Tables for common user names... and possible less common names too. However, what if my usernames are globally unique? Not necessarily unique for my system, but per each user - e.g. email address.<br>\nThere would be no incentive to build a RT for a single user (as @Dave emphasized, the salt is not kept secret), and this would still prevent clustering. Only issue would be that I might have the same email and password on a different site - but salt wouldnt prevent that anyway.<br>\nSo, it comes back down to cryptanalysis - IS the entropy necessary, or not? (My current thinking is it's not necessary from a cryptanalysis point of view, but it is from other practical reasons.)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","security","authentication","jquery-mobile","ldap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13050443,"title":"LDAP Auth through HTML5","body":"<p>I have an HTML5 mobile application built using the JQuery Mobile framework wrapped in a open-source Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) wrapper. </p>\n\n<p>The application has a login screen where you enter the network credentials of my client and authenticate against their Active Directory server in the backend. </p>\n\n<p>The client has provided me with the URI to call but I'm not sure how I would call this URI from my application code.

Now, I'm trying to figure out if I can make it so that the data received from the client can encrypted before it hits our server.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that their browser would encrypt the data using the public part of an asymmetric key pair.

After adding the items to the keychain, I am getting some unexpected results when using SecItemCopyMatching.  Quick summary:  I add exactly one SecIdentityRef to the keychain, but SecItemCopyMatching finds two afterwards.  Let me start with the facts.</p>\n\n<p>I am running my app on an iPod with iOS 4.3.5.</p>\n\n<p>I have an empty app keychain to start with.</p>\n\n<p>My certificates are all created using openssl and deployed to the iPod via a PKCS#12 file as an email attachment.\nThe PKCS#12 file contains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Client certificate</li>\n<li>Client CA certificate (issuer of the Client certificate)</li>\n<li>Root CA certificate (issuer of the Client CA certificate)</li>\n<li>RSA private key of the client certificate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SecPKCS12Import successfully imports the file and the resulting dictionary has the following content:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>one \"identity\"</li>\n<li>one \"trust\"</li>\n<li>one \"chain\" (CFArray which holds the three certificates mentioned above)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using SecItemAdd, I successfully add the \"identity\" to the keychain.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I retrieve the \"chain\" array from the dictionary and attempt to add the certificates.  In doing so, the first one fails with error errSecDuplicateItem.  I assume this is because the first certificate is the client certificate and that it was already added to the keychain when I added the identity.  The other two certificates are added without error.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if I go back and use SecItemCopyMatching with these key/value pairs...</p>\n\n<pre><code> keys   = {kSecClass, kSecReturnRef, kSecMatchLimit}\n values = {kSecClassIdentity, kCFBooleanTrue, kSecMatchLimitAll}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...two identities are returned!  Furthermore, if I retrieve the certificate for each (SecIdentityCopyCertificate) and then the summary (SecCertificateCopySubjectSummary), I see the both identities have the same certificate!</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, when I try to clear the identities from the keychain (SecItemDelete), the first attempt is successful but the second fails with errSecItemNotFound.</p>\n\n<p>It is clear from all the googling I have been doing that there are \"issues\" with the iOS keychain.  However, I have not seen this reported; nor have I seen anything even remotely related.  </p>\n\n<p>So, my questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Am I using SecItemCopyMatching correctly?</li>\n<li>When using SecItemCopyMatching to find identities in the keychain, how does it determine the identities that are present?  Is this dynamic, or strictly based on how many SecIdentityRef items were added?</li>\n<li>could this problem possibly be related to the certificates themselves?  Note that despite this issue, I am still able to retrieve the first identity and certificates in order to respond to didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can post code and/or certificate dump, if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n\n<p>Ken Cross\nSiemens Enterprise Networks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","performance","security","https","asp.net-mvc-4"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13040442,"title":"implications of having a site in full https","body":"<p>I am currently developing an MVC4 web application for eCommerce.

I am not using an inherited ClaimsPrincipal for type-safe retrieval of custom claims. I am just adding new claims which are subsequently lost somewhere in the process. What is the proper way to setup a custom ClaimsPrincipal so the additional claims are not loss between requests.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","security","jvm","weblogic"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2011,"score":6,"question_id":4521119,"title":"Java argument to specify Java.Security file for JVM","body":"<p>I'm looking for a java argument (or perhaps some different method) to allow me to specify a file to be used by the JVM as the java.security file, rather than using the one found in the JDK (in the JRE lib).</p>\n\n<p>To give you a little more context, I am working with a WebLogic server that was set up by someone else and is running two (or more) different JVMs off the same JDK.

It is possible to set properties and providers (typically configured in the file) within code using the Security class (java.security.Security). So, at least in the interim, I plan to write a class that will go through setting up my JVM specific security configurations after startup (essentially overwriting the default configurations provided by the file for the other JVM). While the obvious downside of this solution is that is does not externalize security configurations of this JVM, the solution does provide me a way to set JVM specific properties and providers without affecting the configuration of other JVMs running off the same JDK.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the time and consideration given by others.

Threat: Code substitution (OAuth Login)</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>An attacker could attempt to login to an application or web site\n    using a victim's identity.  Applications relying on identity data\n    provided by an OAuth protected service API to login users are\n    vulnerable to this threat.  This pattern can be found in so-called\n    \"social login\" scenarios.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a pre-requisite, a resource server offers an API to obtain\n    personal information about a user which could be interpreted as\n    having obtained a user identity.  In this sense the client is\n    treating the resource server API as an \"identity\" API.  A client\n    utilizes OAuth to obtain an access token for the identity API.  It\n    then queries the identity API for an identifier and uses it to look\n    up its internal user account data (login).  The client asssumes that\n    because it was able to obtain information about the user, that the\n    user has been authenticated.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the client uses the grant type \"code\", the attacker needs to\n    gather a valid authorization code of the respective victim from the\n    same identity provider used by the target client application.  The\n    attacker tricks the victim into login into a malicious app (which may\n    appear to be legitimate to the Identity Provider) using the same\n    identity provider as the target application.  This results in the\n    Identity Provider's authorization server issuing an authorization\n    code for the respective identity API.  The malicious app then sends\n    this code to the attacker, which in turn triggers a login process\n    within the target application.  The attacker now manipulates the\n    authorization response and substitutes their code (bound to their\n    identity) for the victim's code.  This code is then exchanged by the\n    client for an access token, which in turn is accepted by the identity\n    API since the audience, with respect to the resource server, is\n    correct.  But since the identifier returned by the identity API is\n    determined by the identity in the access token (issued based on the\n    victim's code), the attacker is logged into the target application\n    under the victim's identity.</p>\n  \n  <p>Impact: the attacker gains access to an application and user-specific\n    data within the application.</p>\n  \n  <p>Countermeasures:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>All clients must indicate their client id with every request to\n   exchange an authorization code for an access token.  The\n   authorization server must validate whether the particular\n   authorization code has been issued to the particular client.  If\n   possible, the client shall be authenticated beforehand.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Clients should use appropriate protocol, such as OpenID (cf.\n   [openid]) or SAML (cf. [OASIS.sstc-saml-bindings-1.1]) to\n   implement user login.  Both support audience restrictions on\n   clients.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is rather confusing to me: «the attacker needs to gather a valid authorization code of the respective victim from the same identity provider used by the target client application». What's \"the respective victim\" and what does \"identity provider\" mean in this and subsequent uses?</p>\n\n<p>The whole attack description is obscure. I came to understand it as \"one shouldn't use OAuth 2.0 to implement user login\", but wouldn't that mean that major platforms such as Facebook are vulnerable? And vulnerable to what, exactly?</p>\n\n<p>I probably only need a clarification of some of the terms used in this paragraph.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","security"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12959526,"title":"Non-registration submission, security concern","body":"<p>I've created a simple script that allows a user to post a message, question or discussion on my site.

A month later, after a relentless attack by spam bots, I decided I better add the JavaScript spam prevention code back in.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is obviously used by a lot of programmers. It is currently the 6th most popular tag here at Stack Overflow. It is used on practically every single website that I know of. </p>\n\n<p>The claim that it is a security risk seems bogus to me. I've had JavaScript on in my browser for as long as I remember, and not once have I found out that anything malicious has happened.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript has, of course, been extended into AJAX. And AJAX is the thing that makes the wonderful world of Web 2.0 work. And that includes this wonderful Stack Overflow site.</p>\n\n<p>So is there something I'm missing? Is there something wrong with JavaScript that I'm not aware of?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Follow-up:</p>\n\n<p>I am flabbergasted by the response to my Question.</p>\n\n<p>The responses are strong and vociferous from the Anti-JavaScript people.</p>\n\n<p>There was one pro-JavaScript comment, and it was voted down (as I write this to -2) by the others.</p>\n\n<p>I turned JavaScript off to add this follow-up. I immediately notice three obvious things (There might be more):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A big annoying white on red banner at the top of each page saying: \"Stack Overflow works best with JavaScript enabled\". (Annoyance) </p></li>\n<li><p>Comments cannot be viewed at all or added. You can't vote up or vote down. You can't select the accepted answer.

(Inconveniences)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So as far as I am concerned, turning your JavaScript off results in Annoyances, Loss of Functionality, and Inconvenience.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sorry for the handicapped people who have no JavaScript support, but I still don't get why so many of you are so religiously against using it. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I love what AJAX and its beautiful interfaces and enhanced functionality are doing to the Web. I try to add such features to my site and it annoys me when the Anti-JavaScript people ask me - no, demand of me to take it out because they can't access them. </p>\n\n<p>But how many of you use Stack Overflow with JavaScript off? None I would expect. Your answer would be that you turn it on for sites you trust like Stack Overflow.</p>\n\n<p>Okay. If I make a site that uses Ajax or JavaScript, then I'm fine with you turning it off until you decide to trust my site. But don't expect me to be required to give you all the functionality that I do to people who trust me.

I found the following opinion about JavaScript at the <a href=\"http://www.polepositionmarketing.com/library/wp-spamfree/#wpsf_how_it_works\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP-SpamFree WordPress Plugin page</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Most of the spam hitting your blog originates from bots. Few bots can process JavaScript. Few bots can process cookies. Fewer still, can handle both. In a nutshell, this plugin uses a combo of JavaScript and cookies (on steroids) to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 99%+ of automated spam from ever getting to your site. Almost 100% of web site visitors will have these turned on by default, so this type of solution works silently in the background, with no inconveniences. There are extremely few users (less than 2%) that have JavaScript and/or cookies turned off by default, but they will be prompted to turn those back on to post their comment.</p>\n\n<p>Stats show that among all Internet users, less than 2% have JavaScript turned off, and less than 1% have cookies turned off. This requirement isn’t anything out of the ordinary because most modern websites require the use of JavaScript and cookies for key features — AJAX, for example, won’t work if JS is disabled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall, the very few that might be inconvenienced because they have JS and cookies turned off will be far fewer than the 100% who would be annoyed by CAPTCHA’s, challenge questions, and other validation methods.</strong>\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","security","sql-server-2012","sspi"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"question_id":12944273,"title":"correct security and user setup for sql server database","body":"<p>I am currently on setting a sql server database on a database server.

This obviously implies connection credentials for each website, the more users the more passwords and therefore the more desirable a target for hackers. Just to make sure everyone is on the same page these are the credentials I'm talking about...</p>\n\n<pre><code>$user = 'user';// not actual user, not root either\n$pass = 'pass';// not actual password\n$server = 'localhost';\n$database = mysql_connect($server,$user,$pass,true|false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I'm talking about the passwords used to <em>connect</em> to the database, not the passwords in the database (which for clarification I have hashed with salt and pepper).</p>\n\n<p>I have not read anything that I think remotely suggests you can have 100% foolproof security since obviously the server needs to connect to the database and get the content for visitors 24/7; if I am mistaken I would love to hear how this would be possible.</p>\n\n<p>So let's presume a hacker has root access (or if that does not imply access to the PHP code let's just say then have access to all the PHP source code) and they (in this circumstance) desire to access/modify/etc databases. If we can not prevent them should they have access to the PHP source then we want to slow them down as much as possible. I can keep each site/database connection password in separate files (can as in I'm a few weeks from finishing multi-domain support) for each site and not inside of public_html (obviously). I use serialize and unserialize to store certain variables to ensure certain level of fault tolerance for when the database becomes unavailable on shared hosting (preventing site A from looking and acting like site B and vice-versa) as the database can sometimes become unavailable numerous times a day (my database error logs are written to when the SQL service becomes available again and catches these \"away\" errors). One thought that has crossed my mind is determining a way to store the passwords in one hash and un-hashing them to be used to connect to the database by PHP though I'd like some opinions about this as well please.</p>\n\n<p>If someone has a suggestion from the database perspective (e.g. having the ability to restrict users to SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, etc and not allowing DROP and TRUNCATE as examples) my primary concern is making sure I am SQL neutral as I plan to eventually migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL (this may or may not be relevant though if it is better to mention it). I currently use phpMyAdmin and cPanel and phpMyAdmin shows the connected user is not the same as the site's database user names so in that regard I can still use certain commands (DROP and TRUNCATE as examples again) with that user and restrict the SITE user permissions unless I am mistaken for some reason?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to configure the context of where the connection credentials are accepted? For clarification a hacker with access to the source code would not be accessing the site the same way legitimate users would.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that crossed my mind is system based encryption, is there a near-universal (as in on every or almost every LAMP web host setup) web-hosting technique where the system can read/write the file through Apache that would introduce a new layer that a hacker would have to determine a way to circumvent?</p>\n\n<p>I am using different passwords for each user of course.</p>\n\n<p>I currently am on shared hosting though hopefully my setup will scale upwards to dedicated hosting eventually.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the thoughts on my security concepts and what other concepts could I try out to make my database connection credentials more secure?</p>\n\n<p>Clarification: I am looking for ideas that I can pursue. If there is disagreement with any of the suggestions please ask for clarification and explain your concern in place of debating a given approach as I may or may not have even considered let alone begun to pursue a given concept.

It seems like an odd limitation to put, considering the only way I could see it being abused, would be if someone were to inject Javascript into the page.

As a general rule, XMLHTTPRequest isn't used at all, simply because it's so hard to make an XMLHTTPRequest in a way that's compatible with all major browsers.  It's much easier to just add an img tag to the URL if you want them to load your URL.</p>\n\n<h2>Posting to third party site</h2>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n  $.post(\"http://some-bank.com/transfer-money.php\", \n         { amount: \"10000\", to_account: \"xxxx\" })\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Could be accomplished with</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body onload=\"document.getElementById('InvisbleForm').submit()\"\n    &lt;div style=\"display:none\"&gt;\n        &lt;form id=\"InvisbleForm\" action=\"http://some-bank.com/transfer-money.php\" method=\"POST\"&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"amount\" value=\"10000\"&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"to_account\" value=\"xxxxx\"&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>JPunyon: why would you leave the vulnerability in a new feature</h2>\n\n<p>You aren't creating any more insecurities.  You are just inconveniencing developers who want to use it in a way for good.  Anybody who wants to use this feature for evil (aka awesome) could just use some other method of doing it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I'm marking the answer from <strong>bobince</strong> as correct because he pointed out the critical problem.  Because XMLHTTPRequest allows you to post, with credentials (cookies) to the destination site, and read the data sent back from the site, along with sending the persons credentials, you could orchestrate some javascript that would submit a series of forms, including confirmation forms, complete with any random keys generated that were put in place to try to prevent a XSRF.  In this way, you could browse through the target site, like a bank, and the bank's webserver would be unable to tell that it wasn't just a regular user submitting all these forms.</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","security","iis"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":38,"score":-2,"question_id":12869596,"title":"Security for Account Information on Website","body":"<p>I'm completely new to this and am kind of being shoved into doing a website which does not process any transactions itself, but it does send personal information from client to a server database.</p>\n\n<p>The user will be entering their credit card # and exp. date into our database. <strong>What type of security should I be looking at on the server side?

When he attempted to do so later, he was returned to log-in as before with the \"Please log in\" error. After much head scratching, something incredibly simple came to mind - the client was accessing the site with <a href=\"http://www.example.com/admin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.example.com/admin</a> and everything in the login script was redirecting to <a href=\"http://example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com</a>, so the session cookie that it was looking for was set for another domain. This also explains why he had problems logging in the first time but not subsequent times - the script redirected him to the log-in form without the www.</p>\n\n<p>A quick fix was to write a .htaccess file to remove the www, problem solved. Of course this could also be handled within the login script, which I will improve for future use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>\n\n<p>I develop PHP and MySQL based sites with a home brew CMS and log-in system. My CMS is unique to every client and it has been quite the crowd pleaser - unfortunately the same is not true of my log-in system. The following is a long post but I need to cover the details to try and find a solution. Bear with me..</p>\n\n<p>The system is fairly straight forward, if not a bit hefty. Each user has a salted hash stored in a MySQL table, alongside the SALT. When the user logs in, their SALT is retrieved and the submitted password becomes a salted hash.</p>\n\n<p>If the submitted salted hash matches the one stored in the table, the user is authenticated. Details such as their name, last IP address, and account level (3 levels on most sites) are stored in an array assigned to a session variable. They are then redirected to the landing page of the restricted site to which they logged in (Members Only or Admin/CMS).</p>\n\n<p>Secured pages include a smaller auth.php file that checks to see if the session variable containing their details is present. If not, they are redirected to that site's log-in form with an error message that reads \"Please log-in.\" If it is present, they are allowed to continue and the details stored in the array are assigned to variables.</p>\n\n<p>The problem that many users has reported is that they often need to log-in several times to keep from being bounced back to the log-in form with the \"Please log-in\" error message, or they navigate to another page in the secure site and randomly get bounced back to login with the same error. So, the session variable seems to either not be getting set or it is being cleared for some reason during normal use of the site. </p>\n\n<p>The first problem has NEVER happened to me - over a multitude of devices and networks - and I have witnessed it at a client's office using their laptop. I had them connect to my mobile hotspot and there was no change. However, they were able to log in without any problems using my laptop and my hotspot connection. Unfortunately, I was not able to connect to their network using my laptop, so that variable could not be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>*<strong><em>NOTE - *</em></strong> I forgot to mention initially that the system works normally for problem clients after they have logged in two or three times with the correct credentials. Subsequent log-in attempts while their browser remains open tend to execute without problems thereafter.

So you won't be able to see the credentials unless you have access to the source of the PHP file anyways. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this basically mean that you would need shell access?

If the request succeeds I get a nonce from the server.</li>\n<li>When transaction finishes I receive an array of notification Ids to pass them to GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION request. At this point I need to use nonce received in step 1 from my server. <strong>&lt;- I got stuck here!</strong></li>\n<li>When GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION succeeds I get a signedJson and a signature which I pass to my server. It verifies the purchase and commits the transaction on the server.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What I can not understand so far is two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How to identify a previously generated nonce by incoming IN_APP_NOTIFY intent in my case?</strong> As far as I understand it can correspond to either current purchase completion or another purchase refund. From what I see we have only notification id which has no relation to a REQUEST_PURCHASE request.</li>\n<li><strong>How to securely handle refunds in that way that my server is 100% acknowledged about this event?</strong> The most natural way IMHO is to periodically request Google server from my server to retreive the actual status for the order. Unfortunately, in my country developers can not use Google Checkout API. Another way is to periodically check the order state via device using GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION request passing known notification ids and new nonces.

However, now B has A's access token, and can make all sort of facebook calls on Sam's behalf. Definitely not what we want</li>\n<li>I would like to avoid having to build some trusted server, where for instance A sends its access token, and B then gets a trusted reply of who A is</li>\n<li>I guess in theory B could ask A to post something to facebook, and then check for this content, but this has all sorts of side effects that don't seem desirable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm just wondering whether there is anything out there that could solve this. In theory, B could send A a challenge, A uses its token to sign it, send it back, and B checks the signature with facebook (if this were possible); or B sends a challenge, A uses its access token to have facebook sign the challenge (again, if possible), send the result back to B. Or perhaps there is another obvious solution that I don't see.</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","cakephp","cakephp-2.0","uploadify","swfupload"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12689470,"title":"Cakephp 2.2 and SWFUploader black-holed","body":"<p>I am having a typical file upload method (inside a plugin) in my app and I am using for this Uploadify that uses SFWUpload.\nI used this for an application that is written in CakePHP 1.3 (and it worked OK).

Interchange plus billing means you only pay the processor what Visa/MC charges them, plus a flat fee.  (Amex and Discover charge their own rates directly to merchants, so this doesn't apply to those cards.  You'll find Amex rates to be in the 3% range and Discover could be as low as 1%.

So it's safe against MITM (that cannot edit anything otherwise the endpoint won't be able to regenerate the same signature) and replay attacks (because of the timestamp usage).</p>\n\n<p>That's good for all clients, that knowing the private key, now can perform requested actions on their own data generating a unique signature containing the request data.</p>\n\n<p>The authorization service doesn't generate any token (so it cannot be subject to MITM attacks) and it is only called internally, meaning that a client performs a request directly to the right endpoint to perform certain operations, instead of requesting a token to give that service... then the endpoint receiving that request makes a query to the authorization service asking \"hey, is this requested legit?\" if so the authorization service returns \"200 OK\" and the service performs requested operations, otherwise it returns \"401 Unauthorized\".</p>\n\n<p>What I need now is to allow a special client, a web user interface, to make users login using email/password and use the webUI itself to obtain/edit their data. The webUI will run on HTTPS. Please, consider that creating a new account generates always both user/pwd login and pubkey/privatekey, but actually we're only using pubkey/privatekey. User and pwd are stored inside a db that will be used only by the WebUI, while the pubkey/privatekey is stored inside the Authorization Service (that uses another DB).</p>\n\n<p>Of course to work with customer data I need some way to make the webUI act as it is a client written for the logged user (that has a pubkey/privatekey associated pair to generate the signature). I'm not sure what's the safest way to do this so I'm going to explain several solutions I tought about.</p>\n\n<p>The 1st solution I tought is give the web interface its own pubkey/privatekey, making it a real client, and then edit the authorization service to recognize it and allow it to send the publickey (that can be retrieved by the authorization service) using a header like \"X-Forwarded-For\") and always trust the webUI authority. But I'm scared that somehow I'm missing something that could lead to attacks to exploit this authority to obtain the data you are not authorized for.</p>\n\n<p>The second solution would be, once logged in successfully, transfer both pubkey/privatekey from the Authorization Service to the WebUI that then stores it inside the session, and each time an action is performed it uses that data to generate a valid signature. But I don't really like to pass those data over network (also because this communication should be at least over SSL to avoid the privatekey to be sniffed), and I don't really like to have the private key stored inside a session backend.</p>\n\n<p>The last solution I tought about is rethink the authorization service and also allow authentication by user and password (that will be no more stored inside the webUI but togheter with pubkey/privatekey inside the Authorization Service). This would always require a SSL connection because the webui has to communicate email and password, but if logged correctly it could only store those data inside the session created. Another side effect would be that other services could be implemented to use user/pwd instead of using the signature method, that over HTTP would mean expose data to the world.</p>\n\n<p>I want the strongest and more logical solution, that makes the webUI act as a client because the entire architecture is thought to work on a client-server basis. I'm also available to accept other suggestions not listed here.</p>\n\n<p>Please, tell me if you need to know more to help me.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you (if you've read the whole post :-P)</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","security","sql-server-ce","database-connection"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":12758067,"title":"How can I protect the password for an encrypted SQL Server Compact database?","body":"<p>I have found a few resources that tell me causing a SQL Compact DB to be encrypted is as simple as specifying a password in the connection string.

Project configuration is as follows : Security - \"Enable ClickOnce security settings\" (when its disabled application won't run at all) - \"This is a full trust application\"; \"Signing\" - \"Sign the ClickOne manifests\" (with test certificate which is imported to Trusted Root Certification Authorities). In IE both internet and intranet zones have \"WPF browsers applications\" set to \"Enable\" (that may not have effect because *.xbap is loaded from file system). In case I don't have alternative ways to integrate WPF application into browser (Silverlight is not an option, there is a requirement about full .NET framework targeting) i'm looking for solution of above described problem.

I would like to use nodejs/socket.io to add that kind of functionality. \n<br/><br/>\nFirst problem I found was how to properly authorize user on nodejs side (user is already authenticated on php backend through PHP session). Using <strong>socket.handshake.header.cookie</strong> on nodejs side i can parse and get PHP session id, which I can authenticate through redis/memcache/database (depending on what have I used to save session information).<br/> Everything looks cool when user has only one tab/window of the site opened - when having more and using <strong>session_regenerate_id()</strong>, in nodejs the user authenticates with another sessionid key, so I cannot distinguish two tabs by anything other than the socket id they connected with. When user logouts he shouldn't be getting any messages on any tab (because he already logged out on every tab/window from that browser). So on logout message (sent from browser just before the logout PHP things) I should remove all the socket connections connected to the authorized user id. But what if user logges in on two devices (fe. pc browser and an ipad safaris). After logout on one device, he shouldn't be getting any messages on the device he logged out, not on every device. <strong>How can i distinguish connections from different devices/browsers in socket.io?</strong> Of course not using <strong>session_regenerate_id()</strong> would be efficent here, but what can I do if I really want to use this feature?\n<br/><br/>\nAnother problem I have is rather a security issue (or even question). Let's assume that authorized user in application can see page <strong>example.com/user1</strong> (which is a news feed for user1) and cannot see <strong>example.com/user2</strong> (fe. he doesn't have rights to see it). I'd like socket.io to send update messages to browser when user is on <strong>example.com/user1</strong>, and of course not to send when user is on <strong>example.com/user2</strong> site. On socket.io side I can read the referer address (so presumably, when user is on user2 site he does not get any socket.io connection). The question is: <strong>should I compare the referer address with the rights of authenticated user on node.js side? Or maybe the referer value is <em>safe</em> on the node.js side?</strong> Adding another db check on node.js side would slow it down (because almost every request there should be same database check on two sides - PHP and node.js).\n<br/><br/>\nOr maybe the whole concept of socket.io + PHP application working the way I presented is wrong? </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\n<br/><br/>\nI think I found a way to omit problems with the first question - basically I just add another cookie (besides PHPSESSID) fe. named NODESESSID, which I generate (fe. using uniqid()) when user is authorized. Now authorization on node.js side is comparing PHPSESSID and NODESESSID (both must match). Now, when user logges out he delivers the message <em>logout</em> to socket.io and socket.io disconnects all the sockets with NODESESSID. This is like connecting the benefits of regenerating session id and not regenerating session id (but is not vulnerable to session fixation, isn't it?). </p>\n"},{"tags":["c","security","buffer-overflow","libc"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12340262,"title":"(Another) Return to Libc Attack: Won't Segfault or Return to Libc With Malicious Input.

This adds security to the Web API used for Ajax calls from the web client. The requirements are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The user must logon each time they perform a transaction to verify\nsomeone else has not walked up to the workstation after someone has\nlogged on and walked away.</li>\n<li>Roles cannot be assigned to the web service methods at program time.\nThey must be assigned at run time so that an administrator can\nconfigure this. This information is stored in the system database.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The web client is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\" rel=\"nofollow\">single page application (SPA)</a> so the typical forms authentication does not work so well, but I am trying reuse as much of the ASP.NET security framework as I can to meet the requirements.  The customized <strong>AuthorizeAttribute</strong> works great for requirement 2 on determining what roles are associated with a web service method. I accept three parameters, application name, resource name and operation to determine which roles are associated with a method.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DoThisController : ApiController\n{\n    [Authorize(Application = \"MyApp\", Resource = \"DoThis\", Operation = \"read\")]\n    public string GetData()\n    {\n        return \"We did this.\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I override the <strong>OnAuthorization</strong> method to get the roles and authenticate the user. Since the user has to be authenticated for each transaction I reduce the back and forth chatter by performing authentication and authorization in the same step.  I get the users credentials from the web client by using basic authentication which passes the encrypted credentials in the HTTP header. So my <strong>OnAuthorization</strong> method looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public override void OnAuthorization(HttpActionContext actionContext)\n{\n\n     string username;\n     string password;\n     if (GetUserNameAndPassword(actionContext, out username, out password))\n     {\n         if (Membership.ValidateUser(username, password))\n         {\n             FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(username, false);\n             base.Roles = GetResourceOperationRoles();\n         }\n         else\n         {\n             FormsAuthentication.SignOut();\n             base.Roles = \"\";\n         }\n     }\n     else\n     {\n         FormsAuthentication.SignOut();\n         base.Roles = \"\";\n     }\n     base.OnAuthorization(actionContext);\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>GetUserNameAndPassword</strong> retrieves the credentials from the HTTP header. I then use the <strong>Membership.ValidateUser</strong> to validate the credentials. I have a custom membership provider and role provider plugged in to hit a custom database. If the user is authenticated I then retrieve the roles for the resource and operation. From there I use the base <strong>OnAuthorization</strong> to complete the authorization process.  Here is where it breaks down.</p>\n\n<p>If the user is authenticated I use the standard forms authentication methods to log the user in (FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie) and if they fail I log them out (FormsAuthentication.SignOut).  But the problem seems to be that base <strong>OnAuthorization</strong> class does not have access to <strong>Principal</strong> that is updated so that <strong>IsAuthenticated</strong> is set to the correct value. It is always one step behind. And my guess is that it is using some cached value that does not get updated until there is a round trip to the web client.</p>\n\n<p>So all of this leads up to my specific question which is, is there another way to set <strong>IsAuthenticated</strong> to the correct value for the current <strong>Principal</strong> without using cookies? It seems to me that cookies do not really apply in this specific scenario where I have to authenticate every time.  The reason I know <strong>IsAuthenticated</strong> is not set to the correct value is I also override the <strong>HandleUnauthorizedRequest</strong> method to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequest(HttpActionContext filterContext)\n {\n     if (((System.Web.HttpContext.Current.User).Identity).IsAuthenticated)\n     {\n         filterContext.Response = new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Forbidden);\n     }\n     else\n     {\n         base.HandleUnauthorizedRequest(filterContext);\n     }\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows me to return a status code of Forbidden to the web client if the failure was because of authorization instead of authentication and it can respond accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the proper way to set <strong>IsAuthenticated</strong> for the current <strong>Principle</strong> in this scenario?</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","monotouch","storage"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":2,"question_id":12644304,"title":"How to store public/private key securely","body":"<p>Looking to store public/private key information securely on an iOS device.

Good post, by the way, from my humble point of view.</p>\n\n<p>I must say that I have it almost done. But there is a strange behavior that makes it not to work. Could anyone take a look at my problem and try to give me a clue about the possible solution??</p>\n\n<p>PREVIOUS CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n\n<p>Before developing the instructions at this page, I have the FOSOAuthServerBundle well configured. I complete the process, and I get the token properly, authentication the user credentials and creating the session too. The only thing is that I don't have a specific login form differenced from the main one in my web site. So the page that appears when trying to get the authorization code is the normal login one. What I want is, as described in the manual, to display a different login form, smaller and more specific, to make it friendly for mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>THE PROBLEM</p>\n\n<p>Developing exactly what is described at this page, I get this behavior:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I call \"^/oauth/v2/auth\" with the proper parameters</li>\n<li>As expected, I am redirected to the /auth_login page</li>\n<li>I input a user's credentials (correct login and password)</li>\n<li><p>After the login process, Symfony properly TRIES TO redirect again to \"^/oauth/v2/auth\" with the proper parameters, but, Surprise!!, some interceptor or something is catching that request and I am again redirected to /auth_login.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The funny thing is that the session IS created (I mean, if in that moment I type any existing page in the site in the url bar, it redirects normally to the requested page with all the session and stuff created).\n** So the problem is just with the pattern \"^/oauth/v2/auth\". No matter whether I have or not created session, that it always will be intercepted and redirected to /auth_login (and, so, I don't get the workflow to go correctly in the way to finally get the token.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>THE ONLY DIFFERENCE</p>\n\n<p>Between what I have and what is described in the manual is just that I am using a twig page to display the auth_login form. I don't think this can be a problem, but anyway, I post it next:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form action=\"{{ path(\"acme_oauth_server_auth_login_check\") }}\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"{{ csrf_token }}\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;label for=\"username\"&gt;{{ 'security.login.username'|trans({}, 'FOSUserBundle') }}&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"_username\" value=\"{{ last_username }}\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;label for=\"password\"&gt;{{ 'security.login.password'|trans({}, 'FOSUserBundle') }}&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"_password\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"remember_me\" name=\"_remember_me\" value=\"on\" /&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"remember_me\"&gt;{{ 'security.login.remember_me'|trans({}, 'FOSUserBundle') }}&lt;/label&gt;\n\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" id=\"_submit\" name=\"_submit\" value=\"{{ 'security.login.submit'|trans({}, 'FOSUserBundle') }}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ONE MORE THING</p>\n\n<p>Although it doesn't work either, I am considering a trick (or workaround) that consists in putting the following in the action field of the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{{ path(\"fos_user_security_check\") }}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That means to make the /auth_login form to send the data to the same login_check used by FOSUserBundle instead of FOSOAuthServerBundle's.</p>\n\n<p>The effect in this case is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I call \"^/oauth/v2/auth\" with the proper parameters</li>\n<li>As expected, I am redirected to the /auth_login page</li>\n<li>I input a user's credentials (correct login and password)</li>\n<li>After the login process, the redirection of ^/oauth/v2/auth is well performed and I get the authorization_code</li>\n<li>I complete the whole thing getting the access_token thanks to the ^/oauth/v2/token URL</li>\n<li>Surprise!! Although everything is done well, in this case the session IS NOT created, which is too bad for later calls to the API (the API just doesn't get anything as the session is not created). Imagine, for example a situation in which I want to get from the API a whole list of certain items that belong to the user that entered his or her credentials. Obviously, as the session is not created, all what I get is a redirection to the main page (it is thus how I have configured the firewall at symfony2).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So… everything so weird.</p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate if someone could help me with all this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot</p>\n\n<p>Pedro</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","css","security"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":1,"question_id":12576525,"title":"Is using css display property to control what different levels of users could access a good idea?","body":"<p>my website requires users to login and I want to allow some users to access more information than others.

It is assumed that one should use a random salt and a shitload of iterations to derive secure enough key/IV for the encryption. While deriving bytes from password string using this method is quite useful in some scenarios, I think that's not applicable when encrypting data with symmetric algorithms! Here is why: using salt makes sense when there is a possibility to build precalculated rainbow tables, and when attacker gets his hands on hash he looks up the original password as a result. But... with symmetric data encryption, I think this is not required, as the hash of password string, or the encryption key, is never stored anywhere. So, if we just get the SHA1 hash of password, and use it as the encryption key/IV, isn't that going to be equally secure?</p>\n\n<p>What is the purpose of using <code>Rfc2898DeriveBytes</code> class to generate key/IV from password string (which is a very very performance-intensive operation), when we could just use a SHA1 (or any other) hash of that password? Hash would result in random bit distribution in a key (as opposed to using string bytes directly). And attacker would have to brute-force the whole range of key (e.g. if key length is 256bit he would have to try 2^256 combinations) anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So either I'm wrong in a dangerous way, or all those samples of AES encryption (including many upvoted answers here at SO), etc. that use <code>Rfc2898DeriveBytes</code> method to generate encryption key and IV are just wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["security"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1851,"score":12,"question_id":2995143,"title":"Open source web site vulnerability scanners?","body":"<p>I would like to integrate vulnerability scanner as part of our build process.

I'm not smarter than the rest of the world, and shouldn't even try this. But! I'm going to, anyhow.</p>\n\n<p>My basic problem is that I'm looking to write a little calculator evaluator program that'll take untrusted input, using a subset of python's syntax. I know: use <a href=\"http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ply</a> or <a href=\"http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyparsing</a> and write a parser and there we go. Screwing around with passing globals and locals to <code>eval()</code> will not do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>All the approaches I've seen (and been leery about) try to enumerate evil. Here, I'm trying to enumerate <em>good</em> -- get an AST, allow only a few node types, and then verify that any calls are to one of a set of whitelisted functions. Here's a mini-implementation (and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3759435\" rel=\"nofollow\">a gist</a>):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>import ast\nimport math\n\nSAFE_FX = {\n    'exp': math.exp,\n}\n\nSAFE_NODES = set(\n    (ast.Expression,\n    ast.Num,\n    ast.Call,\n    ast.Name,\n    ast.Load,\n    ast.BinOp,\n    ast.Add,\n    ast.Sub,\n    ast.Mult,\n    ast.Div,)\n)\n\nclass CleansingNodeVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\n    def generic_visit(self, node):\n        if type(node) not in SAFE_NODES:\n            raise Exception(\"%s not in SAFE_NODES\" % type(node))\n        super(CleansingNodeVisitor, self).generic_visit(node)\n\n    def visit_Call(self, call):\n        if call.func.id not in SAFE_FX:\n            raise Exception(\"Unknown function: %s\" % call.func.id)\n\ndef my_safe_eval(s):\n    tree = ast.parse(s, mode='eval')\n    cnv = CleansingNodeVisitor()\n    cnv.visit(tree)\n    compiled = compile(tree, s, \"eval\")\n    return(eval(compiled, SAFE_FX))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, <code>my_safe_eval('2*(4+exp(1.3))')</code> works, while <code>my_safe_eval('[].__class__')</code> tricks and <code>my_safe_eval('open(\"/something/evil\")')</code> is likewise forbidden -- without forbidding <code>__builtins__</code> or <code>__locals__</code> or anything.</p>\n\n<p>I...

The issue is that Symfony2's security component is limited to 30-32 roles/permissions.  One of my projects, a project management/issue tracker system, is going to need more than 32 permissions.  There are a number of different components of the system that need to have there own set of permissions.  Just because someone has create, read, update, or delete permissions to issues does not mean they have those permissions for projects, milestones, etc...

Each browser reloads a page waiting for jobs to come in.</p>\n\n<p>One thing each job does is to make a cross-domain JSONP request to a local server running on the local machine in order to get some information from the system. This works in every browser I've tried except for Opera.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the jQuery code that I'm using to make the request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\n  url: \"http://10.20.30.40:8000/...\",\n  dataType: \"jsonp\",\n  data: someData\n  success: function(data) { ... }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>10.20.30.40</code> host is the local IP address, identifying a local server running on the machine with the browser. The page which is making this request is loaded from a domain name like <code>blah.internal.example.com</code> which is visible to all the machines inside our network.</p>\n\n<p>The first such request made from Opera (I'm using 12.02) succeeds. However, subsequent requests made in the same way are never actually made. They don't show up in the network tab of the inspector.

I need a change that I can make in the preferences or <code>opera:config</code> that will be sticky across sessions.

How does google analytics achieve this? </p>\n\n<p>I have an idea, but I don't know if this would be completely secure.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The customer tells me any domains (including subdomains) that they would like to include my script on.</li>\n<li>I give the user a very small text file that they store on their servers.</li>\n<li>Once my script is loaded, it checks for window.location.host, and tries to fetch the text file from the root of the hosting domain.</li>\n<li>If the file is found, and the contents match the content I generated when I gave the customer the file, I activate the service.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>would this work?</p>\n\n<h1>Why I can not use window.location</h1>\n\n<p>Let's say that my script reads window.location, and sends that to the url <code>mydomain.com?token=ABC&amp;locationhost=goodcustomer.com</code></p>\n\n<p>Now, the owner of baduser.com wants to abuse the account of gooduser.com, so he includes gooduser.com's script. The script now sends an ajax request to <code>mydomain.com?token=ABC&amp;locationhost=badcustomer.com</code></p>\n\n<p>This would not start the service, because badservice.com is not the domain that the owner of goodcustomer.com entered when he signed up. This is easy to circumvent, because badcustomer.com's owner can take a look at my script, notice that it is sending a request to validate the url, and just send his own request. So he would send a request to <code>mydomain.com?token=ABC&amp;locationhost=goodcustomer.com</code>. My server sees this request, compares the locationhost to the domain associated with the token, and starts giving the content meant for goodcustomer.com's users, to badcustomer.com's users. My server has no way of knowing wether the request was sent by my own script, or by a user trying to impersonate the actual customer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","magento","ssl","https","media"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12456237,"title":"HTTPS Failing on Media in Magento","body":"<p>I'm having a problem with a clients magento site that has https enabled on the secure pages,</p>\n\n<p>The website it built heavily around static block content and on the https pages images are pulled from static blocks (over 400 of them) using the media insert in the static block {{media url=\"media/bla/bla/bob.png\"}} these images are comign through as <a href=\"http://site.com/media/bla/bla/bob.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://site.com/media/bla/bla/bob.png</a> </p>\n\n<p>its not realistic, and it wouldn't make any sense to go through and change all these links to direct links.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","security","ssl","username",".net-cf-3.5"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12459642,"title":"WCF + .NET CF + Security with SSL and Username","body":"<p><strong>I have:</strong> An IIS7 Server (WCF must be used) and a WindowsMobile 6.1 device (.NET CF must be used)\n<br><strong>I want:</strong> Secure communication between them with a username/password authentication over WCF.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My ideas:</strong> I started with an SSL connection with selfcreated certificates which works fine.

To retrieve the data, they only need to enter the id number given to them once they have submitted the form, along with the password they chose. During event creation, the user can also check a box to allow for admin retrievable data to be generated, if they elect to. This option is set to false by default.</p>\n\n<p>This clear-text of the event is still kept in memory for purposes of admin-retrieval, as described later.</p>\n\n<p>The event data is secured using AES256 CBC encryption with a securely generated random IV and key. Both the IV and key are then encrypted using a public key (RSA 2048-bit) stored on the server. Both the IV and key are then XOR'd with the SHA-256 hash of the user-supplied password, and subsequently both stored in the DB.</p>\n\n<p>The user password is then hashed with SHA-256 using a 256-bit securely random generated token as a salt, a string is created with a colon delimiter containing the hash and salt, which is then encrypted with the public key (same one as previous) and stored in the database password_hash field.</p>\n\n<p>The clear-text event data then goes through the same process with a  newly randomly generated key and IV for the admin retrieval and stored, the key and IV then encrypted with a different public key (only used for admin retrieval), and stored in the database without being XOR'd against anything.</p>\n\n<p>To retrieve the data, the user enters their event ID and password. First, the password_hash is unencrypted using the private key (stored on the server in a non-web-accessible directory) (the password for that private key is hard-coded into the app), the user-entered password is then rehashed using the salt from the now unencrypted database entry, and if it matches the hash of the stored salted password, the process continues on (else, returns error of \"Event ID not found or password incorrect\").</p>\n\n<p>The encrypted key and IV are then XOR'ed with a newly generated unsalted hash of the user's password, and decrypted with the same private key/password used for the password hash. These are subsequently used to decrypt the event_data, and return the data to the user.</p>\n\n<p>If the admin wishes to retrieve the data, they must upload the private key and enter the private key's password, at which point the admin IV and key are decrypted, the in-memory private key is destroyed, and the admin retrievable event data is decrypted. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, that is my design for this thing, the only current weaknesses I've identified is storing the private key used for event and user password encryption on the server, and having that private-key password hard coded into the app. I can't see a way around that however without spending a lot of money on a hardware based encryption appliance. If anyone can suggest a better way of architecting this to avoid that problem and not inconvenience end users by generating a separate cert for every event and giving them the private key, subsequently forcing them to re-upload it every time they want to decrypt the event data, I'm more than open to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you see any problems other than those ones, I'm also very curious to hear about it, and would love to be given resources to read or an explanation of what the problem is and what I could do to rectify it.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware that I do not possess university-level mathematics knowledge and despite rather wanting to understand encryption, I'm far beneath a level where I can do any sort of cryptographic analysis for myself. With this project, I've simply done as much reading on overviews that were of a level I could understand, and tried to apply that knowledge.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","security","ssl","bouncycastle","keystore"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":117,"score":0,"question_id":12382342,"title":"Creating keystore BKS for https android connection","body":"<p>I found <a href=\"http://blog.crazybob.org/2010/02/android-trusting-ssl-certificates.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tutorial</a> which describes how create and use keystore for https connection.

It seems that certain websites, however, can detect the original (host) IP address. I've investigated the issue a bit and here's what I found.</p>\n\n<p>There are four proxy methods I've tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox with a proxy setting.</li>\n<li>Python with <code>mechanize.set_proxies</code>.</li>\n<li>Firefox in a virtual machine using an internal network, along with another virtual machine acting as a router (having two adapters: a NAT, and that internal network), set up such that the internal network traffic is routed through a proxy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorBrowser</a> (which uses Firefox as the actual browser).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the first three I used the same proxy. The Tor option was just for additional testing, not via my own proxy. The following things are behaviors I've noticed that are expected:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With all of these, if I go to <code>http://www.whatismyip.com/</code>, it gives the correct IP address (the IP address of the proxy, not the host computer).</li>\n<li><code>whatismyip.com</code> says \"No Proxy Detected\" for all of these.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indeed, it seems like the websites I visit do think my IP is that of the proxy. However, there have been a few weird cases which makes me think that some sites can somehow detect my original IP address.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In one situation, visiting a non-US site via Firefox with a non-US proxy, the site literally was able to print my originating IP address (from the US) and deny me access. Shouldn't this be impossible? Visiting the site via the virtual machine with that same non-US proxy, or the TorBrowser with a non-US exit node, though, the site was unable to do so.</li>\n<li>In a similar situation, I was visiting another non-US site from a non-US proxy. If I logged into the site from Firefox within the virtual machine, or from the TorBrowser with a non-US exit node, the site would work properly. However, if I attempted to log in via Firefox with a proxy (the same proxy the virtual machine uses), or with <code>mechanize</code>, it would fail to log in with an unrelated error message.</li>\n<li>In a third situation, using the <code>mechanize.set_proxies</code> option, I overloaded a site with too many requests so it decided to block access (it would purposefully time out whenever I logged in). I thought it might have blocked the proxy's IP address. However, when I ran the code from a different host machine, but with the same proxy, it worked again, for a short while, until they blocked it again. (No worries, I won't be harassing the site any further - I re-ran the program as I thought it might have been a glitch on my end, not a block from their end.) Visiting that site with the Firefox+proxy solution from one of the blocked hosts also resulted in the purposeful timeout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems to me that all of these sites, in the Firefox + proxy and <code>mechanize</code> cases, were able to find out something about the host machine's IP address, whereas in the TorBrowser and virtual machine cases, they weren't. </p>\n\n<p>How are the sites able to gather this information? What is different about the TorBrowser and virtual machine cases that prevents the sites from gathering this information? And, how would I implement my python script so that the sites I'm visiting via the proxy can't detect the host/host's IP address?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","security","acl","role-base-authorization"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":176,"score":3,"question_id":12370162,"title":"PHP complex role-based access control lists","body":"<p>I have already made the database and the php code needed to implement this customized ACL system.

But my issue is here, because to let another application to open these files, I need to provide an Android storage location to the application that I want to use.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code that I'm using right now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent();\nintent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\nFile fileToOpen = new File(activity.getExternalCacheDir().getAbsolutePath() + \n    \"/\" + fileName);\n\nMimeTypeMap mime = MimeTypeMap.getSingleton();\nString extension = fileToOpen.getName().substring(\n        fileToOpen.getName().lastIndexOf(\".\") + 1);\nString type = mime.getMimeTypeFromExtension(extension);\nintent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\n\nintent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(fileToOpen), type);\n\nManager.getActivity().startActivityForResult(intent,\n        ExplorerActivity.FILE_CLOSED_SUCCESSFULLY);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, as you can see in my code, I need to store my real file into the cache directory to open it, so if a thief has an access to the user phone, it can open real files presents into this directory so my application is not secure anymore.\nOf course I'm deleting this plain file right after the user has closed it and I have encrypted it, but the deletion doesn't mean that the file is totally deleted from the phone. Before deletion, I'm rewriting with some null byte but it's not enough for a secure deltion of this file.</p>\n\n<p>So now, what I want from you it's an idea to achieve what I want to do: open a file without storing it into the Android hard storage.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some leads that I had: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open the file with my own app (but it's a lot to implement because there are too many types of files, and I really don't like to develop something which exists already)</li>\n<li>Find a solution to open the file without storing it externally of my application (What I mean is to open the file directly with the byte array of this file)</li>\n<li>Store the file into the phone RAM (I don't know if it is possible)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So this is a non-exhaustive list and any other suggestion will be appreciated. And if you can provide any help about one of the solution that I have proposed, please don't hesitate. Don't hesitate also to tell me if one of my ideas are completely impossible or wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","oauth","wso2"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":128,"score":0,"question_id":12351195,"title":"WSO2 API manager security layer","body":"<p>I hope to use wso2 api manager to expose my webservices to a mobile app.I want to store an api key in the localstorage of the client and use it along with the api calls for the authentication.

This decidion can solve problem with applicatoin modifications done by a administrator. Administrators will have password from keystore and all keys, but they will not have access to keystore file at all. Access to keystore file will have only special security administrators ('rw') and server ('r').

Maybe I should store/retrieve the private key via an authenticated remote file server?</p>\n\n<p>I've searched for best practices, but haven't been able to find much.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class DB {\n\n    protected $_config;\n    protected $_iUserId;\n    protected $_iServerId;\n    protected $_dbConn;\n    protected $_sPubKey;\n    protected $_sPrivKey;\n\n\n    public function __construct($iUserId, $iServerId) {\n\n        //bring the global config array into local scope\n        global $config;\n        $this-&gt;_config = $config;\n\n        $this-&gt;_iUserId = $iUserId;\n        $this-&gt;_iServerId = $iServerId;\n\n        $this-&gt;_sPubKey = file_get_contents(\"public_key\");\n        $this-&gt;_sPrivKey = file_get_contents(\"private_key\");\n        $this-&gt;_sPrivKeyPass = trim(file_get_contents(\"private_key_pass\"));\n\n    }\n\n    //connect to the database\n    public function connect() {\n        try {\n\n\n            $this-&gt;_dbConn = new PDO(\"pgsql:host=\".$this-&gt;_config['db_host'].\" dbname=\".$this-&gt;_config['db_name'],$this-&gt;_config['db_username'],$this-&gt;_config['db_password']);\n\n            echo \"PDO connection object created\";\n        } catch(PDOException $e) {\n\n            echo $e-&gt;getMessage();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public function insertServerDef($sHost, $iPort, $sUser, $sPass) {\n\n        //testing\n        $iUserId = 1;\n\n        $oStmt = $this-&gt;_dbConn-&gt;prepare(\"INSERT INTO upze_server_def (server_id, host_address, ssh_port, username, pass, user_id) VALUES (DEFAULT, :host_address, :ssh_port, :username, pgp_pub_encrypt(:pass,dearmor(:pub_key)), :user_id)\");\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':host_address',$sHost);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':ssh_port',$iPort);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':username',$sUser);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':pass',$sPass);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':pub_key',$this-&gt;_sPubKey);\n\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':user_id',$iUserId);\n        $oStmt-&gt;execute();\n\n    }\n\n    public function getServerDef($iServerId) {\n\n        $oStmt = $this-&gt;_dbConn-&gt;prepare(\"  SELECT server_id, pgp_pub_decrypt(pass,dearmor(:priv_key),:priv_key_pass) As decryptpass \n                                            FROM upze_server_def usd \n                                            WHERE usd.server_id = :server_id\n                                        \");\n\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':server_id', $iServerId);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':priv_key', $this-&gt;_sPrivKey);\n        $oStmt-&gt;bindParam(':priv_key_pass', $this-&gt;_sPrivKeyPass);\n        $oStmt-&gt;execute();\n\n        while($row = $oStmt-&gt;fetch()) {\n            echo \"&lt;pre&gt;\".print_r($row).\"&lt;/pre&gt;\";\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    //close any existing db connection\n    public function close() {\n        $this-&gt;_dbConn = null;\n    }\n\n\n    //close any existing db connections on unload\n    public function __destruct() {\n        $this-&gt;_dbConn = null;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","security","google-maps","sandbox"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":140,"score":0,"question_id":12329799,"title":"Security Sandbox Violation in AS3 accessing images from googleapis.com","body":"<p>I am loading a street view image from the Google Street View Images API.

An issue that has come up is about the security of JavaScript.  For example, there are going to be certain links and UI elements that will only be displayed depending on the roles and resources the user has attached to them.  When the user logs in, it will make a REST call that will validate the credentials and then return back a json object that has all the permissions for that user which will be stored in a JavaScript object.</p>\n\n<p>Lets take this piece of javascript:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.3.3\n(function() {\n  var acl, permissions, root;\n\n  root = typeof exports !== \"undefined\" &amp;&amp; exports !== null ? exports : this;\n\n  permissions = {\n    //data…\n  };\n\n  acl = {\n    hasPermission: function(resource, permission, instanceId) {\n      //code….\n    }\n  };\n\n  root.acl = acl;\n\n}).call(this);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now this code setup make sure even through the console, no one can modify the variable permissions.  The issue here is that since this is a single page application, I might want to update the permissions without having to refresh the page (maybe they add a record that then needs to be added to thier permissions).  The only way I can think of doing this is by adding something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>setPermission: function(resource, permission, instanceId){\n  //code…\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to the acl object however if I do that, that mean someone in the browser console could also use that to add permissions to themself that they should not have.  Is there any way to add code that can not be accessed from the browser console however can be accessed from code in the JavaScript files?</p>\n\n<p>Now even if I could prevent the issue described above, I still have a bigger one.  No matter what I am going to need to have the hasPermission functionality however when it is declared this way, I can in the browser console overwrite that method by just doing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>acl.hasPermission(resource, permission, instanceId){return true;}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and now I would be able to see everything.  Is there anyway to define this method is such a way that a user can not override it (like marking it as final or something)?</p>\n\n<p>Something to note is that every REST API call is also going to check the permissions too so even if they were to see something they should not, they would still not be able to do anything and the REST API would regret the request because of permissions issue.  One suggestion has been made to generate the template on the server side however I really don't like that idea as it is creating a very strong coupling between the front-end and back-end technology stacks.  If for example for whatever reason we need to move form PHP to Python or Ruby, if the templates are built on the client-side in JavaScript, I only have to re-build the REST API and all the front-end code can stay the same but that is not the case if I am generating templates on the server side.</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","security"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":12272784,"title":"Safety of executing arbitrary regular expressions","body":"<p>I really can't think of any, but could there be malicious effects of allowing users to run arbitrary regular expressions?</p>\n\n<p>For example, say I have a website where people can try out regular expressions on a block of text -- is there anything I'd have to \"sanitize\" in the same way as for SQL statements?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","security","aspectj","spring-aop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":1,"question_id":12277944,"title":"How to catch exception in Join point which was thrown from @Around","body":"<p>Following up with this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12248716/conditional-behavior-of-spring-aop-before-advice#comment16421693_12249543\">comment</a> of my previous question.

Where it tells me to select a condition, I choose <strong>All Items</strong>, then I click <strong>Add to List</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5b. Where it now tells me to select an action, I choose <strong>Execute Script</strong>, then I click <strong>Set Values and Add</strong>, which allows me to choose the script called <strong>new-create-folders.js</strong> which I had previously added to the <strong>Scripts</strong> folder within the <strong>Data Dictionary</strong>. Then I click <strong>OK</strong>, and then <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5c. Here where it asks me for the <strong>type</strong>, I choose <strong>Items are updated</strong>. I then enter a title like <strong>create folders rule</strong>. And finally I check <strong>Run rule in the background</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5d. Now I click <strong>Finish</strong> to finalize my rule.</li>\n<li>Now with the rule created, I click <strong>Create</strong>, <strong>Create Content</strong>.\n<br><br>6a. I give my content a name like <strong>name001</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>, then I enter a title like <strong>title001</strong> and an author like <strong>author001</strong>. Then I hit <strong>OK</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What happens now has got me confused; it creates one sub folder called <strong>title001</strong> like I wanted it to, and within that sub-folder it creates another folder called <strong>author001</strong>, and within that folder the file called <strong>name001</strong> has been moved. And that is sort of how I want it to work, but there are still problems. Under the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, there is also a new sub-folder called <strong>New Title 1346102873.393  New Title 1346102873.393</strong> with a folder inside of that called <strong>New Author 1346102873.393</strong>, but there is no file inside of that folder. And I don't know why this folder is created when I only added one piece of content to the <strong>mainFolder</strong>? Also, now that the folders have been created, the rule also looks to have been deleted from the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, i.e. there are no longer any rules applied to the folder. And when I go back to create the rule again on the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, I get the error: <code>Failed to create Rule due to error: null</code>. And below are the errors I get in the log files...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Output/Errors from Alfresco Log</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>17:27:51,373 DEBUG [org.alfresco.repo.jscript.RhinoScriptProcessor]

As you can see I'm loading the script from an external source, which in turn is loading another script from another source, and then dynamically loading it into the page.  As of now it's working but I'm not sure this will always be the case.</p>\n\n<p>I found bits and pieces of information that relate to what I'm looking for but nothing that covers everything (which worries me and makes me think I may be going in the wrong direction).</p>\n\n<p>If it helps, the intended reasoning for this is to allow programming consistency among a team of web developers.  If a script is found to be working well we would throw this into the \"API\" and all the developers would be able to utilize it across different sites.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","security","scala","playframework","owasp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":8,"up_vote_count":17,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1150,"score":17,"question_id":6382900,"title":"playframework owasp top 10","body":"<p>I'm thinking about using <a href=\"http://www.playframework.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play</a> for a large-scale project, so, has anyone battle-tested Play framework for OWASP Top 10?

I'm asking this because I want to add an extra layer of security to prevent session hijacking on my website. If a hacker somehow figures out another user's session ID and makes requests with that SID, how can I detect that there are different clients sharing a single SID on the server and then reject the hijack attempt?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have accepted Gumbo's answer after careful consideration because I've come to the realization that what I'm asking for is impossible due to the restrictions of a <em>stateless HTTP protocol</em>. I forgot about what is perhaps the most fundamental principle of HTTP, and now that I think about this question seems a bit trivial.</p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate what I mean:</p>\n\n<p>After User A logs in on example.com, he is given some random session ID, for simplicity's sake, let it be 'abc123'. This session ID is stored as a cookie on the client side and is validated with a server-side session to ensure the user who logged in remains logged in as he moves from one webpage to another. This cookie of course would not need to exist if HTTP were not stateless. For that reason, if User B steals User A's SID, and creates a cookie on his computer with the value 'abc123', he would have successfully hijacked User A's session, but there is simply no way for the server to legitimately recognize that User B's request is any different from User A's requests, and therefore the server has no reason to reject any request. Even if we were to list the sessions that were already active on the server and try to see if someone is accessing a session that is already active, how can we determine that it is another user who is accessing the session illegitimately and not the same user who is already logged in with a session ID, but simply trying to make another request with it (ie navigate to a different webpage). We can't. Checking the user agent? Can be spoofed - but good as a Defense in Depth measure nevertheless. IP Address? Can change for legitimate reasons - but instead of not checking for the IP address at all, I suggest checking something like the first two octets of the IP, as even a user on a data plan network who constantly has a changing IP for perfectly legitimate reasons would only usually have the last two octets of their IP change.</p>\n\n<p>In consclusion, it is the stateless HTTP that condemns us to never being able to fully protect our websites from session hijacking, but good practices (like the ones Gumbo has provided) will be good enough to prevent a good majority of session attacks. Trying to protect sessions from hijacking by denying multiple requests of the same SID is therefore simply ludicrous, and would defeat the whole purpose of sessions.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","wordpress","security","eval"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":2,"question_id":12255271,"title":"How Can eval() in This Code Be Not Secure?","body":"<p>I'm using the code below to automatically load and declare classes so that I only need to put class files in a folder named classes.

At best, if configure file’s compatibility, a UAC popup request will appear on the screen each time the program runs.</li>\n<li>Place the file name into registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.

Haven’t try this, but read it’s possible, though tricky. Also, services are harder to debug. Looks like an overkill.</li>\n<li>Write a windows service which receives calls from desktop application, does administrative work and return results to the callers.

When phpass authenticates a password or passphrase against a stored hash, it similarly transparently extracts and uses the hash type identifier, the salt, and the iteration count out of the \"hash encoding string\". <strong>Thus, you do not need to bother with salting and stretching on your own</strong> - phpass takes care of these for you. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've bolded the sentence that bothered me.<br>\nI always though that the salt should be somewhat secret, in the sense that it should not be known to the attacker. So if a understood correctly, PHPass stores the salt used in the same hash so it is able to use it when comparing passwords and check if valid.<br>\nMy questions are</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this secure?

This \"add\" View only again includes the \"add_comment\" Element, which - as was said above - includes the actual form.</p>\n\n<p>Now the thing is, I added the Security component to my CommentsController in order to get CSRF protection.

I have attempted to do so before, but I had no better luck that time than I am now.  I got around the problem then, but that method (accessing the security context directly from the code and checking the string of roles it contains for the current user) feels like a hack, and I would like to get it right this time.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I have Spring Security MOSTLY functioning, as far as I know...I can attempt to go to a page with a role-based redirect, and it will redirect me to the login page.  I can log in with good or bad information and be sent to the proper location.  What I cannot do, what I have never managed to do, is get the @Secured or @PreAuthorize annotation to function as I would hope.</p>\n\n<p>Let me try to explain (code will follow).  My welcome/login page is index.jsp and, when you log in, Spring Security sends you to login.html which is where I have a method in my LoginController class mapped.  Inside that method, I try to call a large set of other methods: none of this is supposed to be final, I am just trying to get prove to myself that things are running.</p>\n\n<p>I call two methods that are secured by @Secured, and two methods that are secured by @PreAuthorize, one \"ROLE_ADMIN\" and one \"ROLE_USER\" each.  The account that I am logging into only has the ROLE_USER authority.  This being the case, I would expect to get redirected to my accessdenied.jsp page as per having set that as the target of my Spring Security's access-denied-page attribute.  What I do not expect, and what I am seeing, is that every method is successfully called and run when I log in.</p>\n\n<p>I have (at least attempted to) follow the tutorials.  I have spent days on Google, reading everything that I can find.  I have merged my security context into my context, and everything else that came to my attention as a potential solution.  I apologize if I have been a mite long-winded, but I would rather provide too much information than too little.

However, logging in didn't work anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Our situation is as follows: we use our Grails application pure for its application logic. Authentication is done using a username and password through webservices. As backends we use the database of the app (dao) and a LDAP backend.

We do not use a class such as the User Role for the joins between people and their authorities. Instead we use a many-to-many mapping, as this has always worked for us and is easy to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>Our authority domain class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Authority {\nstatic hasMany = [people: Person]\n\n/** description */\nString description\n/** ROLE String */\nString authority = ''\n\nString authorityType\n\nstatic constraints = {\n    authority(help:'x',class:'wide',blank: false,unique:true)\n    description(help:'x',class:'extrawide')\n    authorityType(help:'x',class:'wide')\n    people(help:'x',selectSort:'username',display:false)\n}   \n\nString toString() {\n      return authority;\n}   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And our Person domain class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Person  {\n\nstatic hasMany = [authorities: Authority]\nstatic belongsTo = Authority\n\n//Authority primaryGroup\n\n/** Username */\nString username\n/** User Real Name*/\nString userRealName\nString familyName\nString givenName\n\n/** MD5 Password */\nString passwd\n/** enabled */\nboolean enabled\n\nString email\nboolean emailShow\n\n/** description */\nString description = ''\n\n\n\nstatic constraints = {\n    username(blank: false, unique: true,help:'x',class:'wide')\n    userRealName(blank: false,help:'x',class:'wide')\n    familyName(blank: false,help:'x',class:'wide')\n    givenName(blank: false,help:'x',class:'wide')\n    email(help:'x',class:'wide')\n    emailShow(help:'x')\n    enabled(help:'x')\n    passwd(blank: false,password:true,show:false,help:'x',class:'wide')\n    authorities(nullable:true,help:'x',sortable:true,selectSort:'authority')        \n}\n\nString toString() {\n      return username;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Config.Groovy, we have defined:</p>\n\n<pre><code>security {\nactive = false\ncacheUsers = false\n\ngrails.plugins.springsecurity.providerNames = ['daoAuthenticationProvider', 'anonymousAuthenticationProvider', 'rememberMeAuthenticationProvider']\n\ngrails.plugins.springsecurity.userLookUp.userDomainClassName = \"Person\"\ngrails.plugins.springsecurity.authority.className = \"Authority\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As far as the documentation goes, this should work by all means (and so it did for the \"old\" Acegi setup). </p>\n\n<p>To gather some more insights I briefly activated LDAP and found the same issue. WireShark told me that no LDAP calls were made during the login process. My guess would be that either there's something wrong with the code in the Authenticate function or SpringSecurity doesn't know how to pick up our domain classes. </p>\n\n<p>I'd be glad to read any insights!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","security","codeigniter","xss"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6783,"score":6,"question_id":5337143,"title":"CodeIgniter - why use xss_clean","body":"<p>if I'm sanitizing my DB inserts, and also escaping the HTML I write with <code>htmlentities($text, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8')</code> - is there any point to also filtering the inputs with xss_clean?

I have control over the RESTful API code/server and also am building the Android app.  I've setup the API to use OAuth 2 with authorization code grant flow (with client ID and secret), and I auto-approve users without them having to approve the client since we own both client and provider.  We use CAS for SSO and I am using this for the Authorization server as part of the OAuth 2 process when the user logs in to retrieve the token.</p>\n\n<p>I am contemplating various ways to secure the data on the Android app.  I've concluded that storing the client id and secret on the device is definitely not going to happen, but am thinking that storing the auth token might work, since it is only risk to the individual user (and really only if they happen to have a rooted phone).</p>\n\n<p>Here are two options I have thought of.  They both require me to have a sort of proxy server that is CAS protected, does the dance with the API server, and returns the auth token.  This gets rid of the need for storing the client id and secret in the app code.</p>\n\n<p>Here are what I've come up with:</p>\n\n<p>1) Require the user to enter their password to access data each time they startup the App.  This is definitely the most foolproof method.  If this were done, I'd probably want to save the userID for convenience, but in that case couldn't use the CAS login (since it's web-based). I might be able to use a headless browser on the backend to log the user into CAS and retrieve the token based on what they enter in the Android form, but this seems hacky. Saving the userID is similar to what the Chase app does (if you happen to use this one) - it saves the userID but not your password between sessions.</p>\n\n<p>2) Store the auth token on the Android device. This is a little less secure, but almost foolproof. When the user starts the app for the first time, open the webpage to the CAS login of the proxy server that returns the token (similar to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps</a>).  After the user logs in and the token is returned to the app, encrypt it and store it private to the application.  Also, use ProGuard to obfuscate the code, making the encryption algorithm more difficult to reverse engineer.  I could also work in a token refresh, but I think this would be more of a false sense of security.</p>\n\n<p>3) Don't use CAS but come up with another way to get an auth token for the service.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice of how others have implemented similar scenarios (if it's been done)?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","public-key-encryption","privatekey","certificate-authority","smime"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":137,"score":0,"question_id":11996229,"title":"Whats wrong with being your own Certificate Authority and self-signing for your email encryption?","body":"<p>Is there any real reason to use a 3rd party Certificate Authority for your own email security?</p>\n\n<p>( meaning using S/MIME )</p>\n\n<p>I found I am able to become my own CAuthority and create my own self-signed root certificates...and they work just fine installed on my machines and mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a compelling reason to use a 3rd party's paid certificates instead of my own self-generated and signed ones that I control?  </p>\n\n<p>I keep thinking - the person or entity I most trust with the authority of my validated encrypted emails... is ME!... why would I let an additional un-verifiable by me entity into that chain of communication? - if who Im sending emails to is others who know me and trust that its me..? and why would I PAY them? </p>\n\n<p>I can understand if the communication is between my commercial website and unknown outside individuals who don't know me and are transacting money... but for personal email? between family and well known friends or co-wokers?  </p>\n\n<p>Is there something else I don't understand about public-private key encryption that makes having a validated big 3rd party give me the certificates worth paying for?</p>\n\n<p>I understand the need for SSL 3rd party verify when dealing with commerce on websites or trusting websites with your secure connectivity.

And then add more security on the server side by hashing the hash with a per user salt?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n\n<p>Kim</p>\n"},{"tags":["query","security","malicious"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":12012617,"title":"Suspicious string of numbers sent by user on web app","body":"<p>I have a web application and something odd has happened in the database, as in every user had its' sex changed to female, which is very troubling. </p>\n\n<p>I see that some user has sent a series of messages to another user with the following text:</p>\n\n<p>hajQuery17205850606500171125_1345170243079\nhajQuery17205850606500171125_1345170243080\nhajQuery17205850606500171125_1345170243082\nhajQuery17205850606500171125_1345170243084\nhajQuery17205850606500171125_1345170243086</p>\n\n<p>What is this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","mysql","security","encryption","cryptography"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":134,"score":3,"question_id":2639215,"title":"MySQL - connection and security","body":"<p>I was wondering if someone could tell me if there is any potential security breeches that could occur by connecting to a sql database that does not reside at 'localhost' i.e. via ip address?</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Phil </p>\n"}]}
