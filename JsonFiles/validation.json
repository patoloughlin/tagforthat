I'm working in a web-based (Struts 2) project with lots of JSPs, and most of <code>input, select, table</code> and <code>a</code> elements are defined with only with the <code>name</code> attribute, no <code>id</code> set, such as:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;input name=\"myname\" class=\"myclass\" value=\"\" type=\"text\"/&gt;</code> </p>\n\n<p>So far so good, except that unfortunately there's a lot of javascript validation for those fields, and as far as I could read the code before leaving most of them actually refer to the elements with <code>document.getElementById</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The catch here is that this is an old application (not that much old actually) only compatible with IE-6 and IE-7 (I didn't searched the net in order to understand how IE actually seems to find the element only with the <code>name</code> attribute, but I guess it must do something). No surprise every other single browser complains and cries.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm trying to come up with a simple solution: look up all JSPs that defines <code>input, select, table</code> and <code>a</code> elements with the <code>name</code> attribute but not <code>id</code> in order to fix the HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Using my good ol' friend <a href=\"http://rubular.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rubular.com</a> I came up with the following:</p>\n\n<p><code>/&lt;(?:(input|select|a|table))\\s+((?!id).)*&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>This will catch every referred element without <code>id</code>. But how can I actually assert that only those with <code>name</code> are matched?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, another important point. The definition of the elements are in a single line, so it's most probable that there arent't such things as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input name=\"...\"\n       class=\"...\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["html5","validation","markup"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13280955,"title":"Is a specific Doctype ever required?","body":"<p>Topic title is the question really. Is a specific DocType ever required? If so, in what situation(s)?</p>\n\n<p>I'm designing a jQuery slideshow script for a Wordpress plugin with quite a large user base. As a result, it needs to be designed to work with a lot of use cases. I'm trying to decide if I should go with using data attributes, or informative classes for Javascript reference only ('js-transition-slide, js-transition-fade, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Using data attributes is much easier when things get complicated, such as setting numerical values (js-delay-500, etc), but is HTML5. This personally doesn't bother me, or 99% percent of users, but in the past (for doing something similar) I've been contacted by a user who was concerned about their page invalidating with a particular DocType due to the plugin markup. I can't recall entirely why this DocType was required (lost the email), but I think it may have had something to do with some HTTPS payment pages and security validation. I actually think this may have tied in with one of the plugin links not being HTTPS as well. Really vague, I know.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that kind-of poses another question. Is valid markup ever officially required as well?</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate anyone who can enlighten me. Again, I'm all for HTML5, as are most, but with the nature of such things (like Wordpress plugins) it can be important to support a wide range of use cases not to alienate specific users (or at least provide them with alternative options).</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net-mvc-3","validation","jquery-validate","html.dropdownlistfor"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13277806,"title":"dropdownlistfor + jquery validation","body":"<p>I am creating an application in asp .net mvc3 c#.

This only allows the first group that is validated to work. The second panel can not be validated.</li>\n<li>Unbinding the submit handler before calling the new <code>validation()</code> method. This didn't do what I would have thought. It removes all validation (seemingly) permanently and the form submits without validation.</li>\n<li>Clearing out the validation object with <code>$.removeData($('form'), 'validator')</code> before trying to call the validator again.

I tried changing the bindings back to error/save but still have no luck.</p>\n\n<p>My code is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event extends Backbone.Model\n    url: -&gt;\n      '/events' + (if @isNew() then '' else '/' + @id)\n\n    validation:\n      title:\n        required: true\n      start_date:\n        required: true\n      end_date:\n        required: true\n      description:\n        required: true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then define a test as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>describe \"Event\", -&gt;\n  beforeEach -&gt;\n    @title = \"Foo\"\n    @description = \"Bar\"\n    @start_date = new Date\n    @end_date = new Date\n\n\n    @event = new CPP.Models.Event {\n      title: @title\n      description: @description\n      start_date: @start_date\n      end_date: @end_date\n    }\n\n  describe \"when saving required fields\", -&gt;\n    beforeEach -&gt;\n      @error_spy = sinon.spy();\n      @event.bind('invalid', @error_spy)\n\n    it \"should not save when title is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'title': \"\"\n      expect(@error_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n\n    it \"should not save when start_date is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'start_date': \"\"\n      expect(@error_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n\n    it \"should not save when end_date is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'end_date': \"\"l\n      expect(@error_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n\n    it \"should not save when description is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'description': \"\"\n      expect(@error_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n\n    it \"should not save when location is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'location': null\n      expect(@error_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n\n  describe \"when saving optional fields\", -&gt;\n    beforeEach -&gt;\n      @success_spy = sinon.spy();\n      @event.bind('valid', @success_spy)\n\n    it \"should save when deadline is empty\", -&gt;\n      @event.save 'deadline': \"\"\n      expect(@success_spy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However when I run my tests I seem to get <code>Error: Expected Function to have been called once.</code> for all of them and on further inspection of the @event object I find that the spy is never called.</p>\n\n<p>I think it might be something to do with mixing in the validation on the Model's prototype via\n<code>_.extend(Backbone.Model.prototype, Backbone.Validation.mixin);</code> as defined on the backbone.validation readme, but I cannot seem to get this to work either.</p>\n\n<p>I've had a look at the question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8441612/why-is-this-sinon-spy-not-being-called-when-i-run-this-test\">Why is this sinon spy not being called when I run this test?</a> however I've had no luck with incorporating the answer into my code either.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone could tell me what I'm doing wrong I'd be very grateful!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong>\nI managed to fix my code as follows:\n(1) I added <code>_.extend Backbone.Model::, Backbone.Validation.mixin</code> into my application</p>\n\n<p>(2) I then followed the advice given in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10865364/qunit-sinon-js-backbone-unit-test-frustration-sinon-spy-appears-to-fail-to-d\">this question</a> to bind my spy on initialize.

The validation works fine -- fields which are required are successfully monitored. However, when I go to reset my form -- I only see the red background for my inputs clear, not the validation messages.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/resetForm\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery validate documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resets input fields to their original value (requires form plugin),\n  removes classes indicating invalid elements and <strong>hides error messages</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's all the info I think is relevant to the issue. Please let me know if you would like to see anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how I generate a DOM element in my Model. This element needs validation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Model.ascx\n&lt;div class=\"detailsRow required\"&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Site) %&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedSiteID, new SelectList(Model.Site, \"Key\", \"Value\"))%&gt;\n    &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.SelectedSiteID)%&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n//Model.cs\n[DisplayName(\"Site\")]\npublic List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; Site { get; set; }\n\n[Range(0, int.MaxValue, ErrorMessage = \"Site required\")]\npublic int SelectedSiteID { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Site is a select list which starts with a value of -1. Any other selection is valid. As such, I validate on a range from 0 to max.</p>\n\n<p>Over in JavaScript, I run the following code against my form when the user presses the 'Submit' button on the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var form = workflowDialogContent.find('form');\n$.validator.unobtrusive.parse(form);\n//Maintain a reference to the current formValidator to be able to reset.\nvar formValidator = $.data(form[0], 'validator');\n\nif (form.valid()) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user pressed submit, the form is validated and my validation message is shown if the selected site has a value of -1.</p>\n\n<p>Now, whenever the a selection is changed, I want to reset my form. I've taken this logic from: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2086287/how-to-clear-jquery-validation-error-messages\">How to clear Jquery validation error messages?</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>$(window).on('change', '#SelectedSiteID', function () {\n    //Returns the formValidator we maintained a reference to.\n    var validator = WorkflowDialogBuilder.getCurrentFormValidator();\n    validator.resetForm();\n    //TODO: resetForm's documentation says that it hides the errors, but I did not experience this, so I am doing it manually.\n    //$('.field-validation-error').empty();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I run this code... the highlighting is removed, but the error messages remain.

O maybe a third, more elegant option?</p>\n\n<p>TIA!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ajax","ruby-on-rails-3","validation"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":13242315,"title":"Rails remote forms validation","body":"<p>Just a simple question I have followed the railscast -> <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery-ajax-revised\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery-ajax-revised</a></p>\n\n<p>Its nice how for remote true works, but how I cna validate the model ? </p>\n\n<p>I have this one</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for [:admin,@course], remote: true  do |f| %&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"field\"&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.label :title, \"The title:\" %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"field\"&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.label :description, \"Descripcion:\" %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=\"actions\"&gt;\n   &lt;%= f.submit \"Send\"%&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How I handle te error ??</p>\n\n<pre><code>def create\n\n  @course = Course.new(params[:course])\n\n  respond_to do |format|\n    if @course.save\n      format.html { redirect_to admin_index_url, :notice=&gt; 'Done !!' }\n      format.js\n    else\n      format.html { flash.now[:alert] = \"Not done\" \n                    render \"new\"\n                  }\n      format.js\n    end\n  end        \nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>any ideas why this dont works ??</p>\n"},{"tags":["validation","symfony2","validator","symfony-2.1"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13246829,"title":"Not working annotation validatation in Symfony 2.1","body":"<p>Entity property:</p>\n\n<pre><code> /**\n * @var string $content\n *\n * @ORM\\Column(name=\"content\", type=\"string\", length=300)\n * @Assert\\NotBlank(message=\"Please enter question\")\n * @Assert\\Length(\n *   min = \"15\",\n *   max = \"300\",\n *   minMessage = \"Text question must be larger than 15 symbol\",\n *   maxMessage = \"Text question must be less than 300 symbol\"\n * )\n */\nprotected $content;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Form submit (In controller):</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Add questions\nif ($request-&gt;getMethod() === 'POST') {\n  $formQuestion-&gt;bind($request);\n\n  if ($formQuestion-&gt;isValid()) {\n    // Here code save question\n  }\n  else {\n    $errors = $formQuestion-&gt;getErrors():\n    // Null array ((\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No error shows ((\nWhy not read annotation validation.

Also I do not want to keep individual properties for each member. A future requirement will make the value's number to be dynamic, so I may use a loop to define the inputs for each element, but lets not focus on this now.\nSo here is the problem. When I submit the page, the conversion is not correct. For instance, if my input was 1, 2.0, 3 (and 2 empty inputs for the last two elements, they are not mandatory), I receive the following array [1, \"2.0\", 3, \"\", \"\"], where 1 and 3 are of type <code>BigDecimal</code>, and 2.0 and the last 2 members are strings. This causes <code>ClassCastexception</code> each time I try to get a member of the array list, because by definition is generic and the generic type is <code>Double</code>. It seems that <code>BigDecimal</code> cannot be cast to <code>Double</code>. (It is obvious that the string cast attempts will also fail). Now, I'd have expected at least all members to be converted by the converter and be of the same type. Also, I need a way to get correctly as Double. I also tried the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h:inputText id=\"value1\" value=\"#{myBean.values[0]}\"&gt;\n    &lt;f:converter id=\"javax.faces.Double\" /&gt;\n&lt;/h:inputText&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it caused an exception:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;f:converter&gt; Default behavior invoked of requiring a converter-id passed in the constructor, must override ConvertHandler(ConverterConfig)</code></p>\n\n<p>I must admit I am new to the JSF technology, but as far as this article <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf3/</a> is concerned, there was no need to override anything.

They each have more than 1 argument that we would like to be bound. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = \"/a/b\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n@ResponseBody\npublic Response getAB(ARequest aRequest, BRequest bRequest) throws ServiceException {\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This obviously works fine. However, one quirk in our requirements is that we get request parameters that contain <em>underscores</em>. For example; on the endpoint above we'd get a request that looks like: <code>http://x:8000/a/b?req_param=1</code>. This causes default Spring binding to fail, because in our objects we'd like to have bound we define <code>req_param</code> camel-cased (<code>reqParam</code>) rather than use underscores in our Java code.</p>\n\n<p>To solve this we have implemented our own annotation (<code>@Camelize</code>) and our own custom <code>WebArgumentResolver</code>, which we've registered in the Spring context. We then annotate our controller method arguments with <code>@Camelize</code>, which causes our custom <code>WebArgumentResolver</code> to step in and correct the binding. This also works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Now the issues arise, more specifically it would appear that when we want to also <em>validate</em> our arguments this fails. For example, continuing with the example above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = \"/a/b\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n@ResponseBody\npublic Response getAB(@Camelize @Valid ARequest aRequest, Errors aRequestErrors, BRequest bRequest) throws ServiceException {\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This fails with the exception: <code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Errors/BindingResult argument declared without preceding model attribute. Check your handler method signature!</code>.</p>\n\n<p>It would appear that we cannot use our custom <code>WebArgumentResolver</code> and validate using <code>@Valid</code> at the same time. We have narrowed it down to the custom <code>WebArgumentResolver</code>, in the sense that <em>as soon as</em> this <em>doesn't</em> return <code>UNRESOLVED</code>, Spring MVC will just not bother with validation and throw the exception above.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can anyone confirm that this is the expected behaviour?</li>\n<li>Is there a work-around for this?

In case validations problems are to be reported back to the user there exists a more complex interface <code>ValidationAware</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>declarative</strong> validation, each action to validate gets its own validation file called <code>myactionname-validation.xml</code> in which the validators are declared using an XML description language.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>At the company where I work we are using the programmatic validation principle, with a small sized validation framework (written internally) to help reuse common validator patterns.

The book gives a lot of instructions on <em>how</em> to setup declarative validation, however it hardly touches the subject of <em>why</em> the declarative way is preferable.</p>\n\n<p>I see some of the general arguments which are at times held in favor of declarative XML-style configuration, but I can't really see them to apply here: changing this configuration (i.e. validation) is something which is tightly coupled with the model processed by the action and the GUI used to modify values on the model. This is not something which needs to be configurable 'on-the-fly' without recompilation.</p>\n\n<p><em>What arguments are there to use declarative style validation in struts2?</em></p>\n\n<p>Is it worth it to dive into yet another XML markup dialect and bother with handling of the separate validation.xml files?

I have been using the Wicket-1.4 DTDs, and with it there are warnings all over the place, except for the <code>wicket:id</code> attribute.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the file header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n    xmlns:wicket=\"http://wicket.apache.org/dtds.data/wicket-xhtml1.4-strict.dtd\"\n    xml:lang=\"de\" lang=\"de\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I did some research, and I found <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3025454/how-do-i-make-intellij-recognize-wicket-html-tags\">this</a> question, which has some really valuable info in the comments to the accepted (and outdated) answer. I downloaded the <a href=\"http://wicket.apache.org/dtds.data/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.5 XSD file</a> from the Wicket website, as recommended, manually added it to IDEA in the <em>Schemas and DTDS</em> preference panel, and provided <code>http://wicket.apache.org</code> as its URL. </p>\n\n<p>Now the file header looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" \n      xmlns:wicket=\"http://wicket.apache.org\" \n      xml:lang=\"de\" lang=\"de\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The file seems to be set up all right - I can hover over a <code>&lt;wicket:container&gt;</code> and IDEA correctly identifies it as being defined in the XSD.  But alas, it's only a partial victory. :( </p>\n\n<p>The Wicket-specific XML <em>tags</em> are recognized correctly, but instead, I now get warnings for every use of <code>wicket:id</code> in element attributes. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5zWk.png\" alt=\"Snapshot of lots of yellow warning labels\"></p>\n\n<p>I have triple-checked the XSD file, and I can see that the attribute has been correctly declared and should work just fine - there seems to be a problem with the way IDEA validates HTML.  Also, <code>&lt;wicket:container&gt;</code> now has an error marker that says \"required attribute 'id' is missing\". The funny thing is: It's not the html attribute <code>id</code> that is required, but <code>wicket:id</code>...  </p>\n\n<p>I have been searching all over for a solution, but so far to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>I am almost at a point now where I will switch back to the 1.4 DTD, with which the only thing that was recognized was the <code>wicket:id</code> attributes, and instead add all the Wicket tags to the ignore list, so that at least the annoying warnings go away.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else experienced this?

With WebAPI, I can now have POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET methods on an ApiController. However, validation still needs to happen. </p>\n\n<p>I have successfully been able to put remote validation action methods on an ApiController and get them to work. Before submitting a POST, PUT, or DELETE for a resource, the client can POST to one or more validation URL's to validate user input and receive appropriate validation messages. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, should these remote validation actions be on an ApiController? Or a regular MVC controller? It seems to me having them all in the ApiController makes the most sense, because that class can then encapsulate everything having to do with resource (and resource collection) mutations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: reply @tugberk</strong></p>\n\n<p>I should elaborate. First, we are not using DataAnnotations validation. There are already rich validation rules and messages configured on the domain layer commands using FluentValidation.NET. Many of the validation classes use dependency injection to call into the database (to validate uniqueness for example). FluentValidation has good pluggability with MVC ModelState, but <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13045097/304832\">I have not found a good way to plug it into WebAPI ModelState yet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we are doing validation at the POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints. Clients do not need to know the validation endpoints in order to discover what went wrong. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var command = Mapper.Map&lt;CreateCarCommand&gt;(carApiModel);\ntry\n{\n    _createHandler.Handle(command);\n}\ncatch (ValidationException ex)\n{\n    return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, ex.Message);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clients will get a 400 response along with a message indicating what went wrong. Granted, this is not as granular as the response in the example you linked to. Because we are just returning a string, there is no easy way to parse out which fields each validation message belongs to, which is needed for our own HTML + javascript client of the API. This is why I spiked out adding more granular validation endpoints (as a side note, they are consumed by field-specific knockout-validation calls on our javascript client).</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-3","validation","qtip"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1793,"score":4,"question_id":7017030,"title":"ASP.NET MVC Validation Using qTip jQuery Plugin","body":"<p>I am using the solution found <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6802045/integrating-qtip-with-mvc3-and-jquery-validation-errorplacement\">here</a> to show client side validation errors in a tooltip using the qTip jQuery plugin.

I seem to get along fine with standard live validation.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a demo of what I have at the moment: <a href=\"http://dev.carsavingexpert.com/index.php?option=com%5Fchronocontact&amp;chronoformname=custom%5Flivevalidation%5Ftest\" rel=\"nofollow\">link text</a></p>\n\n<p>The method to give a responce to the ajax username check simply changes a with a message in to make it visable, so I want to use a livevalidation check to manage the ajax responce - so I can link them together (check for blank, then in use, then invalid, then pass as ok) and have my responses output the same way.</p>\n\n<p>I currently have this form code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n$script = \"\n$('uname').addEvent('blur', function(e) {\n   e = new Event(e).stop();\n   // Show the spinning indicator when pressing the submit button...\n   $('indicator1').setStyle('display', 'block');\n\n   var username = $('uname').value;\n   if ( username != '' ) {\n        var url = 'index.php?option=com_chronocontact&amp;chronoformname=custom_livevalidation_test&amp;task=extra&amp;format=raw';\n        var jSonRequest = new Json.Remote(url, {\n           onComplete: function(r) {\n              $('indicator1').setStyle('display','none');\n               if ( r.username_ok ) {\n                 $('username_msg').setHTML(\\\"&lt;span style='color:green;'&gt;Username '\\\"+username+\\\"' is OK&lt;/span&gt;\\\");\n              } else {\n                 $('username_msg').setHTML(\\\"&lt;span style='color:red;'&gt;Sorry, username '\\\"+username+\\\"' is already taken&lt;/span&gt;\\\");\n              }\n         }\n      }).send({'username': username});\n   }\n});\n\";\n\nglobal $mainframe;\nif ($mainframe-&gt;isSite())\n{\n\n$doc =&amp; JFactory::getDocument();\n$script = \"\nwindow.addEvent('domready', function() {\n$script\n});\n\";\n$doc-&gt;addScriptDeclaration($script);\n};\n\n\n$script = \"\nvar uname = new LiveValidation('uname', { \n  validMessage: 'This is a valid username', \n  wait: 500\n});\nuname.add(Validate.Presence, {\n  failureMessage: 'Username must not be blank!'\n});\nuname.add(Validate.Format, {\n  pattern: /^[a-zA-Z\\-_]{4,16}$/, \n  failureMessage: 'Username must be between 4 and 16 characters' \n});\n\";\n\nglobal $mainframe;\nif ($mainframe-&gt;isSite())\n{\n\n$doc =&amp; JFactory::getDocument();\n$script = \"\nwindow.addEvent('domready', function() {\n$script\n});\n\";\n$doc-&gt;addScriptDeclaration($script);\n};\n?&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"cf_label\"&gt;Username: &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;input style=\"\" id=\"uname\" name=\"uname\" class=\"\" title=\"\" value=\"\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n&lt;span id=\"indicator1\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/hourglass.gif\" alt=\"checking...\" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;div id='username_msg'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;input type='submit' name='submit' value='submit' /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this being the json part that runs in the background:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$json = stripslashes($_POST['json']);\n$json = json_decode($json);\n\nif ( $json-&gt;username ){\n    $db =&amp; JFactory::getDBO();\n    $query = \"\n        SELECT COUNT(*)\n           FROM `jos_users`\n           WHERE `username` = \".$db-&gt;quote($json-&gt;username).\";\";\n    $db-&gt;setQuery($query);\n    $response = (bool) !$database-&gt;loadResult();\n    $response = array('username_ok' =&gt; $response );\n    echo json_encode($response);\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So looking at the livevalidation documentation, you can use a custom validation in this fashion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Pass a function that checks if a number is divisible by one that you pass it in args object\n// In this case, 5 is passed, so should return true and validation will pass\nValidate.Custom( 55, { against: function(value,args){ return !(value % args.divisibleBy) }, args: {divisibleBy: 5} } );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am finding this to be very cryptic - I would think I should be able to point to 'function(r)' thats all ready there - but I doubt I am doing it the right way,</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed any light, I am (hoping!) to understand it as well as uncover a solution!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Updates *</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am now led to believe that this code for the validate.custom part should work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var uname = new LiveValidation('uname', { \n  validMessage: 'This is a valid username', \n  wait: 500\n});\nuname.add(Validate.Presence, {\n  failureMessage: 'Username must not be blank!'\n});\nuname.add(Validate.Custom('uname', { against: function(r){\nreturn !(r.username_ok) }, args: {} } ),\nfailureMessage: 'This username is already taken' \n});\nuname.add(Validate.Format, {\n  pattern: /^[a-zA-Z\\-_]{4,16}$/, \n  failureMessage: 'Username must be between 4 and 16 characters' \n});\n\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However it seems that I have an architecture issue - live validation wants an instant answer, and ajax takes place in the background.  I have had a suggestion to investigate the 'observer pattern' thats an entirely new concept to me - I am usually playing with the graphical design and structure side of a cms!</p>\n\n<p>Any further help / clarification appreciated as I will have to come back to this and get it working!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","jquery-ui","validation"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13145063,"title":"jQuery detect empty form how to?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6056705/empty-field-validation-in-jquery\">empty field validation in jquery</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to detect if a form is empty or not.

Am I'close?</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Symfony 2.0.1 with Doctrine 2.1.1, MySQL as Database.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br />\n-lony</p>\n\n<p><strong>The \"Movie\" Entity:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * @ORM\\Table()\n * @ORM\\Entity\n * @ORM\\InheritanceType(\"JOINED\")\n * @ORM\\DiscriminatorColumn(name=\"type\", type=\"string\")\n * @ORM\\DiscriminatorMap({\"movie\" = \"Movie\", \"series\" = \"Series\"})\n * \n * @DoctrineAssert\\UniqueEntity(\"title_orginal\")\n */\nclass Movie {\n\n  /**\n   * @var integer $id\n   *\n   * @ORM\\Column(name=\"id\", type=\"integer\")\n   * @ORM\\Id\n   * @ORM\\GeneratedValue(strategy=\"AUTO\")\n   */\n  private $id;\n\n  /**\n   * @var string $titleOrginal\n   *\n   * @ORM\\Column(name=\"title_orginal\", type=\"string\", length=255, unique=\"true\")\n   */\n  private $titleOrginal;\n\n  ..\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","validation","function","email"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":35,"score":-2,"question_id":13081566,"title":"JavaScript E-mail Validation","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/validate-email-address-in-javascript\">Validate email address in Javascript?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I want a JavaScript function to validate the following criteria:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>end with .com , .net and .org only</li>\n<li>not include 2 adjacent non-alphanumeric characters (for example  ..  or  --)</li>\n<li>at least 2 other characters after @</li>\n<li>contain the @ character only once</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know how to do number 1 and 4, but for number 2 and 3, I can't get it working properly. \nCould you help me with this please?</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net","validation"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1800,"score":1,"question_id":5179038,"title":"ASP.NET validators and jquery","body":"<p>I have an <strong>addressControl</strong>, which contains several textboxes and RequiredFieldValidators. </p>\n\n<p>A page contains 2 <strong>addressControls</strong> and checkbox.

My issues arises in certain circumstances, I do not want the form to submit to the \"subPage\" (the default action on the form).  Instead I want it to simply close the modal-form, staying on the page that displayed the modal.  (This occurs in the event that the email is already in the system - do not want to take the user to the secondary form page showing a message that the email is already in the system).</p>\n\n<p>If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").click(function(event){ blah blah blah }); - then I can control the submission vs. non-submission.  However, I then lose the HTML5 form validation feature.  If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").submit(function(event){ blah blah blah }); the form validation works, but the page submits and the event is not being captured by the code.</p>\n\n<p>All the researching I've done to date indicates that IE7 does not play well with the .submit event, however, I need the .submit event for the form validation to work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way for these three things to work together?  IE7 is the only browser causing my issue.  the .submit/form validation works as intended in FF, IE9, Opera, and Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Not sure what the best practice is for this one.</p>\n\n<p>I guess another option would be to create another ViewModel and another partialView specifically for modifying a user but that seems sloppy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DynamicActionUserModel {\n    public string Action { get; set; }\n    public RegisterModel RegisterModel { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class RegisterModel {\n    [Required]\n    [Display(Name = \"User Name\")]\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [DataType(DataType.EmailAddress)]\n    [Display(Name = \"Email\")]\n    public string Email { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [StringLength(100, ErrorMessage = \"The {0} must be at least {2} characters long.\", MinimumLength = 6)]\n    [DataType(DataType.Password)]\n    [Display(Name = \"Password\")]\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n\n    public string[] SelectedRoles { get; set; }\n    public MultiSelectList Roles { get; set; }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>[HttpGet]\npublic ActionResult CreateUser() {\n    var model = new DynamicActionUserModel {\n        Action = \"CreateUser\",\n        RegisterModel = new RegisterModel {\n            Roles = new MultiSelectList(System.Web.Security.Roles.GetAllRoles())\n        }\n    };\n\n    return PartialView(\"_UserPartial\", model);\n}\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic ActionResult ModifyUser() {\n    var model = new DynamicActionUserModel {\n        Action = \"ModifyUser\",\n        RegisterModel = new RegisterModel {\n            Roles = new MultiSelectList(System.Web.Security.Roles.GetAllRoles())\n        }\n    };\n\n    return PartialView(\"_UserPartial\", model);\n}\n\n[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult ModifyUser(DynamicActionUserModel model) {\n    bool isEqual = true;\n\n    if(!ModelState.IsValid) { // this is always false because password is empty\n        return PartialView(\"_UserPartial\", model);\n    }\n\n    var user = Membership.GetUser(model.RegisterModel.UserName);\n    // do stuff\n    Membership.UpdateUser(user);\n\n    return Json(new {success = false});\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>View</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>@using RobotDog.Models\n@model IEnumerable&lt;RobotDog.Models.UserModel&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- table of users --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"modify-form\"&gt;\n    @Html.Action(\"ModifyUser\")\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"create-user-form\"&gt;\n    @Html.Action(\"CreateUser\")\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>PartialView</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>@model RobotDog.Models.DynamicActionUserModel\n\n@using(Html.BeginForm(Model.Action,\"Admin\", FormMethod.Post, new { @class = \"ajax\" })) {\n    &lt;!-- Email --&gt;\n    @Html.TextBoxFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.Email, new { @class = inputSize, placeholder = \"Email\"})\n\n    &lt;!-- UserName --&gt;\n    @if(Model.Action == \"ModifyUser\") {\n        @Html.HiddenFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.UserName)\n        &lt;span class=\"input-xlarge uneditable-input\"&gt;@Html.DisplayNameFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.UserName)&lt;/span&gt;\n    } else {\n        @Html.TextBoxFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.UserName, new { @class = inputSize, placeholder = \"User Name\" })\n    }\n\n    &lt;!-- Password --&gt;\n    @if(Model.Action == \"Createuser\") {\n        @Html.PasswordFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.Password, new { @class = inputSize, placeholder = \"Password\"})\n    }\n\n    &lt;!-- Roles --&gt;\n    @Html.ListBoxFor(x =&gt; x.RegisterModel.SelectedRoles, Model.RegisterModel.Roles)\n\n    &lt;!-- Submit --&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" class=\"btn\"/&gt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","validation","knockout.js","knockout-validation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":0,"question_id":12988464,"title":"issue with custom validation rule for duplicate entry in array","body":"<p>I am trying to use knockout.validation plugin.

Thank you for reading.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  I have been playing around and I came up with this:</p>\n\n<p>SECOND EDIT: As noted by TallMaris, the ROCounter selctor was wrong, so it is now corrected but still fails with the same error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {\n    $(\"#ROCounter\").rules(\"add\", {\n        required: ($(\"#RO-Yes\").is(\":checked\")) &amp;&amp; ($('#ROCounter') &lt; 1),\n        messages: {\n            required: \"Please enter further information\"\n        }\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it broke all the validation and caused an error in the jquery.validate.min.js file: \n\" TypeError: Cannot read property 'form' of undefined\".</p>\n\n<p>ROCounter is a hidden field.

Once I get that part figured out, I can probably figure out the actual rule coding for it.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","asp.net","ajax","validation"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12981169,"title":"How to maintain serverside validation and clientside validation","body":"<p>When we have some controls in ASP.NET, it's of course preferable to use both clientside and serverside validation.

Why are they converted in the way they are and should I treat them as valid even if it might not be transparent for the user, who maybe just forgot to enter the periods (<code>65536</code> instead of <code>6.5.5.36</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Any help is most appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc-3","validation","jquery-validate"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":2,"question_id":12955332,"title":"Validation of child object","body":"<p>I have an object that contains a child object. eg.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Person\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Car Car { get; set; }\n }\n\n public class Car\n {\n     public int CarId{get;set;\n     public string Name { get; set; }\n     public string Year { get; set; }\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then on my Razor view i use a DropDownlistFor, with the list of cars that the user can select.

I've written an SQL function in PostgreSQL (8.1, for now) which does some cleanup on some string input.  For what it's worth, the string is an LDAP distinguished name, and I want there to consistently be no spaces after the commas - and the function is clean_dn(), which returns the cleaned DN.  I want to do the same thing to force all input to another couple of columns to lower case, etc - which should be easy once I figure this part out.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I want this function to be run on the \"dn\" column of a table any time anyone attempts to insert to or update and modify that column.  But all the rule examples I can find seem to make the assumption that all insert/update queries modify all the columns in a table all the time.  In my situation, that is not the case.  What I think I really want is a constraint which just changes the value rather than returning true or false, but that doesn't seem to make sense with the SQL idea of a constraint.  Do I have my rule do an UPDATE into the NEW table?  Do I have to create a new rule for every possible combination of NEW values?  And if I add a column, do I have to go through and update all of my rule combinations to refelect every possible new combination of columns?</p>\n\n<p>There has to be an easy way...</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","validation","robots","antispam"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":3,"question_id":12708933,"title":"Fighting robot spam different way","body":"<p>I have a website with simple form that posts input as tweets to a twitter account.</p>\n\n<p>There is no captcha or any kind of anti-spam system installed, so it's only logical that spam-bots have been posting their bogus content like crazy. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I want to build a validation that does not require any sort of captcha.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I've been thinking and I need your honest opinion.</p>\n\n<p>If robots are posting their stuff without using mouse or keyboard (probably by using some sort of generated script), then that actually means that they cannot give any sort of focus to the form itself.</p>\n\n<p>My idea is to create a simple js condition that the form cannot be submitted without gaining some sort of focus.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think about this?\nAny other sort of similar ideas?</p>\n\n<p>thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["validation","fluentvalidation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":12742495,"title":"FluentValidation and the GreaterThanOrEqualTo rule with the value 0","body":"<p>I have a problem with fluentvalidation (version 3.4.6.0 with fluentvalidation.MVC4, jQuery validation 1.9.0.1), the validation will fail when the value is 0 and it should not.

CustomerId { get; set; }\n\n    public string CustomerName { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where virtual properties are properties that may be or not a required fields. And then I have several derived model from base like this one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class OpportunityModel0: BaseOpportunityModel\n{\n    [Display(Name = \"Value\")]\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = \"Name is required\")]\n    [RegularExpression(@\"^[-+]?\\d{1,10}(\\.\\d{0,4})?$\", ErrorMessage = \"Must be a number\")]\n    public override decimal?

I've written helper method for sending message to service and waiting for result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def authenticateAwait(email:       String,\n                      password:    String\n                     ): Either[String, Option[User]] = {\n  try {\n    val future = authenticate(email, password)\n    Right(Await.result(future, timeout.duration))\n  } catch {\n    case _ ⇒ Left(\"Unable to connect to authentication server\")\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It returns <code>Left[String]</code> with an error description if message can't be sent, or there is no response. If service response received, it returns <code>Right[Option[User]]</code>. Service responds with <code>Option[User]</code> depending on authentication result.</p>\n\n<p>To perform actual authentication I've created form with a couple of validators, here it is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>val loginForm = Form(\n  tuple(\n    \"email\"    → email,\n    \"password\" → nonEmptyText\n  ) verifying (\"Invalid email or password\", result =&gt; result match {\n    case (email, password) ⇒\n      User.authenticateAwait(email, password) match {\n        case Left(_) ⇒ true\n        case Right(optUser) ⇒ optUser.isDefined\n      }\n  }) verifying (\"Unable to connect to authentication server\", result =&gt; result match {\n    case (email, password) ⇒\n      User.authenticateAwait(email, password) match {\n        case Left(_) ⇒ false\n        case Right(optUser) ⇒ true\n      }\n  })\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One thing worries me about this code, it calls <code>authenticateAwait</code> twice. It means exactly two messages will be sent per single validation. What I actually need, is to call <code>authenticateAwait</code> once, store result and perform various validations on it. It seems there is no simple solution.</p>\n\n<p>To perform authentication, access to the form fields required, it means the form should be bound and then validated, but there is no way to attach errors to the existing form(am I wrong?).</p>\n\n<p>Errors can be attached to the form only during its creation, therefore I should perform authentication in the validators, but then aforementioned problem occurs.</p>\n\n<p>The temporary solution I came with is to define a method and a <code>var</code> inside it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>def loginForm = {\n  var authResponse: Either[String, Option[commons.User]] = null\n\n  Form(\n    tuple(\n      \"email\"    → email,\n      \"password\" → nonEmptyText\n    ) verifying (\"Invalid email or password\", result ⇒ result match {\n      case (email, password) ⇒\n        authResponse = User.authenticateAwait(email, password)\n        authResponse match {\n          case Left(_) ⇒ true\n          case Right(optUser) ⇒ optUser.isDefined\n        }\n    }) verifying (\"Unable to connect to authentication server\", result ⇒ result match {\n      case (email, password) ⇒\n        authResponse match {\n          case Left(_) ⇒ false\n          case Right(optUser) ⇒ true\n        }\n    })\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is clearly a hack. Are there any better solutions?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nIn my opinion, form should only sanitize input, but authentication should be performed later outside the form.\nThe problem is that errors are sent to the view as a part of the <code>Form</code> and it is impossible to attach errors to the existing form. There are no simple way of creating new form with the errors too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","validation","jquery-dialog"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":2,"question_id":12701721,"title":"jQuery dialog not firing if I add validation","body":"<p>I want to popup a jquery dialog form to allow user to fill in their data.

I have repository classes that use NHibernate to persist my domain model.</p>\n\n<p>My model consists of a larger tree structure (<code>Recipe</code>s containing <code>Operation</code>s containing <code>Phase</code>s). Operations and phases both contain a dynamic list of key-value-mappings as an <code>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code>. The corresponding NHibernate mapping for an <code>Operation</code> is</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;class name=\"Operation\" table=\"operations\"&gt;\n  &lt;id column=\"id\" type=\"int\" generator=\"native\" /&gt;\n  &lt;property name=\"Name\" column=\"name\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;map name=\"Parameters\" table=\"operation_params\"&gt;\n    &lt;key column=\"operation\" /&gt;\n    &lt;index column=\"param\" type=\"string\" /&gt;\n    &lt;element column=\"value\" type=\"string\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/map&gt;\n\n  &lt;list name=\"Phases\" cascade=\"all-delete-orphan\"&gt;\n    &lt;key column=\"operation\" /&gt;\n    &lt;index column=\"`index`\" /&gt;\n    &lt;one-to-many class=\"Phase\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/list&gt;\n&lt;/class&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, that part is easy and works quite well. The <code>Operation</code> class currently is a POCO with nearly no logic inside, a simple data container.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My problem is: I have to validate the parameters against an external schema my application reads from an .xml file. The schema contains restrictions for single parameters (range, valid values etc.) as well as dependencies between several parameters (i.e. the valid values vary depending on another parameter's value).</p>\n\n<p>What is the best way to integrate my validation logic? I read a lot the last few days and until now, I stumbled upon the following alternatives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Add the validation logic to the model class itself.</p>\n\n<p>For this, I don't know how to properly inject the validation schema into the objects created by NHibernate. I don't need the validation functionality all the time, only when the user is editing the parameters or when I'm importing an operation (e.g. from a backup). So maybe I could implement the actual validation logic in the model class and inject the validation rules using a property whenever I really need validation?\nIs it considered good practice to add that functionality to the model classes that I store using NHibernate or should the model classes stay 'dumb'?</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a decorator class for the validation logic that wraps around my <code>Operation</code> objects.</p>\n\n<p>This way I would use the wrapper everytime I need validation and the bare model class when I only need to display it. My problem here is that my ViewModel classes already are wrappers, so I would get another layer of wrapping here. Also, as the Operation class is part of a larger tree structure (Recipe/Operation/Phase) I would need to create wrappers for the collections and map collection changes back to the underlying collections which may be a complex task.</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a service class that I call passing the operation whenever I want to validate it. </p>\n\n<p>The problem that I see here is that the service is stateless and would therefore have to re-validate the whole parameter list everytime the user changes a single parameter. This doesn't seem to be the best approach, especially when I want to fire some kind of a change event for the UI when the validation status for a parameter changes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What is the common approach for my problem? Is there a pattern I haven't found yet that is perfectly what I need? I mean, there are a lot of implementations out there that rely on external schema definitions for validation (read: XML/XSD and similar document structures), there just have to be some geniuses who already found the perfect solution for my problem ;-) Help me, SO!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","validation","gui","connect"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":2,"question_id":12682860,"title":"GUI not updating despite use of validate()","body":"<p>Here is a Connect Four program I'm making.

I have a program that creates and load files.</p>\n\n<p>When I load a file into my program, I rely on a component listener that tells me when is the specific component \"full\", and then moves all of the components according to that.</p>\n\n<p>I add each component on the top, and then listener register when parent component is \"filled\" and moves the bottom compoennt to a new parent it also creates. Think of it as adding a new line of text to the begining of a houndred page MSWord document.</p>\n\n<p>That listener also relys on the GUI setup - if everything in memory is not painted to the screen, it grabs wrong component heights (usually being 0) and uses them in it's calculations which then come out wrong, and everything gets messed up.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a flow chart of that part of my program:</p>\n\n<p>(everytning happens on a JPanel in a JFrame)</p>\n\n<pre><code>trigger opening method:\n{\n    repeat this x (lets say e.g. 100) times:\n    {\n        trigger addComponent method\n        {\n            add component\n            {\n                adding component triggers the component listner 8if there is no more room in parent)\n                {\n                    move all of the components one place down, move the ones out of bounds to next \"page\"\n                    repaint and revalidate whole JFrame (inside listener)\n                }\n            }\n            repaint and revalidate whole JFrame (part of addComponent method)\n        }\n        repaint and revalidate whole JFrame(part of opening methid, after component addition)       \n    }\n    repaint and revalidate whole JFrame (as a part of opening method, final repaint/validate)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason for this may repaint/validate is that addComponent method, as well as the listener has other functions and is called in other places where that is the only (optimal) place for repainting/validating.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that JFrame doesn't get repainted until the very last(final) validate/repaint call in opeoning method. I tried adding Thread.sleep(1000) to several places in the code (after validate/repaint) to proved this.</p>\n\n<p>Also, as far a I know, when a component listener is triggered, it stops at the line which triggerd it, then executes itself, and then continues from that line, right?</p>\n\n<p>How do I fix this? How do I force my program to repaint/validate after each new component was added ant then again after the listener did it's job?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reply to the first two comments</strong>:\nFirstly, Thread.sleep(1000) was just to diagnose the problem. Right before Thread.sleep(1000) method was repaint/validate method, so I thought if I pause the program right after reapint() was called, after every pause, GUI would be repainted ad I would see new element added, which was not the case.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, regarding to the lengthy calculations, those calculations aren't that long (executing this with 20 components gets momentary results, though not ones that are desired). Also, that calculations require removing and adding components to the GUI quite often (every 10-20 lines), so Incorporating SwingWorker in that is close to impossible, and not needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, I think you missed the whole point. Length of execution is not the real problem here, nor the freezing of the GUI (whic doesn't really occurr, not long enough to be noticable, anyway). The problem is that repaint/validate was called in the loop for total of 3-4 times for every component (cca. 60-80 times if I open a file with 20 components), and the only time I saw it being executed is when the last time it was called, after the loop...</p>\n\n<p>I even put System.out.println(\"something\") method right before and right after the repaint/validate. It printed out \"something\" twice, but repaint/validate never happened.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","validation","select"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2473,"score":2,"question_id":3916669,"title":"JQuery validation : How to check items in multiple select","body":"<p>I have a form using JQuery validation plugin.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"Distribution[]\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"dist_europe\" class=\"required minlength:1\" value=\"Europe\" /&gt;  Europe \n&lt;/label&gt;\n\n&lt;select name=\"Europe[]\" size=\"5\" multiple id=\"Europe\"&gt;\n   &lt;option value='Albania'&gt;Albania&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='Andorra'&gt;Andorra&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='Austria'&gt;Austria&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to do 'conditional' validation.\neg.

The abbreviated form of this would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SomeObject updateOperation ( @CheckInput AnInputClass param)... \n...where the annotation is defined as\n...\n@Constraint(validatedBy = CheckInputValidator.class)   // this is the coupling issue\npublic @interface CheckInput { ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since this all happens server-side, there should be no need to have Java clients have to have this CheckInputValidator class; however, I am seeing no options.   First, I <em>like</em> having the validations in the API - they tell users what will be validated.  If I could break the dependency and move the validation down to the implementation that would seem like an acceptable tradeoff.  However that results in the exception below so it seems like I am stuck.

Since (maybe) I have other methods in this controller that don't take a Duck, I enable the @Valid with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@InitBinder(\"duck\")\nprotected void initBinder(DataBinder binder) {\n    binder.setValidator(new MyDuckValidator());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where MyDuckValidator implements the org.springframework.validation.Validator interface.  </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that I want the Id (primary key) passed in on the \"updated Duck\" to be validated to be non-Null.  But when I create a Duck, it is perfectly valid for that Id to be null.  This seems like \"Validation 101\", but I can't seem to figure it out from any of the examples or documentation.   Does anyone know of a simple solution?  I don't mind have two validators and wiring those in.  However, I do not want to corrupt the API just to work around Validation....</p>\n"},{"tags":["validation","yii"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12580660,"title":"Yii CValidator Rules : how to validate outside of a model","body":"<p>I need to validate some variables values in Yii;</p>\n\n<p>I dont have a <code>model</code>, and i need a pre build yii <code>public method</code>.</p>\n\n<p>some of them must be integer, other string;</p>\n\n<p>The values are being passed with GET.</p>\n\n<p>I tryed all the validation classes that yii has and none works.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone tryed this and succeded ?</p>\n\n<p>i need something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$validator = new CValidator();\n\n$result = $validator-&gt;validate(array($key=&gt;$value));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>opened for sugestions</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","regex","asp.net-mvc-3","validation","input-validation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":145,"score":0,"question_id":12567194,"title":"Custom model validation is not firing in ASP.net MVC3","body":"<p><strong>Custom model validation is not firing in ASP.net MVC3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following is my model for Member module, it'll be used to get the member details. </p>\n\n<p>Now I've to put two constraints on input (using model validation only, JavaScript validation is not an option). </p>\n\n<p>1) Avoid some special characters, to prevent HTML Injection.</p>\n\n<p>2) Allow alphanumeric data which allow some other special characters like #$&amp;

But i can not pass the objects, I may be dumb but i'm not sure how to do it. Like if i were to have the objects in the ASP.net page it would be no issue but since i am creating these in the c# code i'm not sure how to do so.</p>\n"}]}
