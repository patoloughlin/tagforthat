First of all, how does SSIS determine that the double quote between the B and the C is not terminating that column value? Is it because the following characters are not a comma column delimiter or a row delimiter (CRLF)? And why does Excel export it this way?</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#page-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, here are a couple of traits of a CSV file:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas\n   should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:</p>\n\n<p>\"aaa\",\"b CRLF\n   bb\",\"ccc\" CRLF\n   zzz,yyy,xxx</p></li>\n<li><p>If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote\n   appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with\n   another double quote.  For example:</p>\n\n<p>\"aaa\",\"b\"\"bb\",\"ccc\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, it looks like SSIS doesn't like it that way when importing. What can be done to get Excel to create a CSV file that could contain ANY special characters used as column delimiters, text delimiters or row delimiters in the data?  There's no reason that it can't work using the approach specified in Wikipedia,. which is what I thought the old MS DTS packages used to do...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I use Notepad change the input file to </p>\n\n<pre><code>Col1,Col2,Col3,Col4,Col5,Col6,Col7,Col8\n\"1\",\"ABC\",\"AB\"\"C\",\"D,E\",\"F\",\"03\",\"3,2\",\"AB\"\"C\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Excel reads it just fine </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jw16G.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>but SSIS returns</p>\n\n<pre><code>The preview sample contains embedded text qualifiers (\").

Which means I can't just delete everything in <code>TABLE B</code> and do an insert from <code>TABLE A</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This script will be a once off. So no need to do things like linked server, replication, etc. Appreciate the answers though guys. =)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ok - so I've gone with Oleg's answer (VS2010 Data Compare). Quick, easy, and works a charm.</p>\n\n<p>Not to say the other answers are incorrect. I appreciate all the answers!</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server-2008","tsql","join","rownumber"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":13175412,"title":"Return rows around row with a certain value with joins","body":"<p>I have fairly complicated join query from which I want to select a few rows around a result with a certain id.</p>\n\n<p>The query currently looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WITH results AS \n  (\n    SELECT t1.id,  t1.position, t1.points, t2.name\n      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY t1.position ASC, t1.points DESC) AS rn\n      FROM Table1 t1\n      JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.Table1id\n      /* Several more joins here, some of which limit the result set */\n  )\nSELECT * FROM results\nWHERE rn &lt; ( SELECT rn+3 FROM results WHERE  id = @someid ) \nAND rn &gt; ( SELECT rn-3 FROM results WHERE id = @someid )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to solve this?

SPs that normally execute in 500ms, suddenly are up arond 50 seconds. Forget about saving data...application .net code will time out before the data even makes the trip.</p>\n\n<p>First time this happened was about 4 weeks ago. I kicked off a profiler so I could see if there were excessive queries or something, and didnt see anything strange. So, I copied one of the batches from the profile and executed it in SSMS. From that moment, the performance was perfect again. Application was snappy and no issues.</p>\n\n<p>Next time it happened, I remembered that just running a batch in ssms seemed to \"fix\" the issue. So I took some benchmarks first and did it again. Same thing. Running ANY batch in SSMS relieves whatever is happening. I have reproduced this about 15-18 times over the past 4 weeks: The application comes to a crawl, and then I run any query in ssms, and all is well.</p>\n\n<p>This is obviously a problem. In order to find out what is running or going on, I have to run a batch--which makes the problem stop. SO the act of trying to observe the issue resolves it.

name collision in SQL Server view joining database architecture","body":"<p>First of all, sorry the way I write, bad English here.</p>\n\n<p>Please, consider the following scenario:</p>\n\n<p>I made my database architecture combining views as such:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Entity <code>City</code> has the columns { <code>city_id, city_name, state_name, ...</code> }</li>\n<li>Entity <code>User</code> has the columns { <code>user_id, user_name, user_login, city_id, ...</code> }</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each entity has a view, the <code>city</code> view does not have FK to any other entity, so its a simple select.</p>\n\n<p><code>User</code> entity have one FK to <code>city</code> entity, so it makes a join with the <code>city</code> entity in the view.</p>\n\n<p>As the following example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>create view vw_user as\n    select user.user_id,\n           user.user_name,\n           user.user_login,\n           vw_city.*\n    from user (nolock)\n    inner join vw_city (nolock) on vw_city.city_id = user.city_id\ngo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if you have an entity like user_access with a FK to user, the view of <code>user_access</code> will have an inner join to <code>vw_user</code>, and it will bring up all the columns from <code>user</code> and <code>city</code> entities.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I just make a query on the view, and it returns the full entity with all the foreign references.</p>\n\n<p>This works great, and make the maintenance procedures very easier, I have a stored procedure that recompile all the views if any change is needed to one of the entities.</p>\n\n<p>But, it has a problem, and I discovered this in a very bad situation, the system that uses this architecture is working very fast and smooth already, and I need to join two entities that share the entity city for example, so it generates a collision of columns, SQL Server does not allow this in views, you can execute a query with collision with no problem, but you can't do it in a view.</p>\n\n<p>So, this is my problem, I need to find a way to fix this, but I can't find an answer to it myself.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I ended up doing is making a hard-coded view with the columns renamed.</p>\n\n<p>But I want a solution for the entire architecture, something permanent, like an upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>This architecture is followed in code, with C#, so there is a dependence on the column names.</p>\n\n<p>When I read the data from the query, I need to get the data from the column name, so this code can be reused with other classes, doing the same thing that the view does in the query, in the c# code.</p>\n\n<p>So, getting data with ordinal is out of the question.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, and sorry, but this is very hard to describe.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql-server-2008"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":43,"score":-3,"question_id":13126723,"title":"Connect to sql

All 64 bit. The 80% load average comes from this machine showing about 20% cpu load.</li>\n<li>The table is simple, has no primary key, only an index on a relational reference (instrument reference) and a unique (within a set of instruments, so this is not enforced) timestamp.</li>\n<li>The fields on the table are: timestamp, instrument reference (no enforced foreign key), data type (char 1, one of a nubmer of characters indicating what data is posted), price (double) and volume (int). As you can see this is a VERY thin table. The data in question is tick data for financial instruments.</li>\n<li>The quesstion is also about hardware etc. - mostly because i see no real bottleneck. I am inserting in multiple transactions and it gives me a benefit, but a small one. Discs, CPU are not showing significant load, network io wait is high (300ms/second, 30% at the moment), but this is on the same virtualization platform which runs JSUT the two serers and has enough cores to run all. I pretty much am open to \"buy anotehr server\", but i want to identify the bottlenech first.... especially given that at the end of the day I am not grabbbing what the bottleneck is. Logging is irrelevant - the bulk inserts do NOT go into the data log as data (no clustered index).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would vertical partitioning help, for exmaple by a byte (tinyint) that wuold split the instrument universe by for example 16 tables, and me thus doing up to 16 inserts at the same time? As actually the data comes from different exchanges I could make a partition per exchange. This would be a natural split field (which is actualyl in instrument, but I could duplicate this data here).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some more clarifications: Got the speed even higher (90k), now clearlyl mited by network IO between machines, which could be VM switching.</p>\n\n<p>What I do now is do a connetion per 32k rows, put up a temp table, insert into this with SqlBUlkdCopy, THEN use ONE sql statement to copy to main table - minimizes any lock times on the main table.</p>\n\n<p>Most waiting time is now still on network IO.

Also tried setting the compatibility to SQL 2005 (I use this setting as I want to match our production server) and SQL 2008.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what I try, the log remains at 1964.25Mb, with 30% used, which is still growing.\nI'd like the log to go back down near 0% and reduce the log file size to a say 100Mb which is plenty. My database must hate me, it just ignores everything I ask it to do regarding the log.</p>\n\n<p>One further note, the production database has quite a few replicated tables, which I turn off when I perform a restore on my development box by using the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- Clear out pending replication stuff\nexec sp_removedbreplication\ngo\nEXEC sp_repldone @xactid = NULL, @xact_segno = NULL,\n     @numtrans = 0, @time = 0, @reset = 1\ngo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Trying:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT log_reuse_wait, log_reuse_wait_desc\nFROM sys.databases\nWHERE NAME='bybox'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Returns</p>\n\n<pre><code>log_reuse_wait  log_reuse_wait_desc\n0   NOTHING\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any words of wisdom or things to try are all welcome!</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>Looking at <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqldatabaseengine/thread/9f9ae5c5-3031-4963-bb16-c7ed05d9890a/\">this</a> and setting the recovery model to FULL I have tried the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>USE master\nGO\n\nEXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'ByBoxData', N'C:\\&lt;path here&gt;\\bybox.bak'\n\n-- Create a logical backup device, ByBoxLog.\nEXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'ByBoxLog', N'C:\\&lt;path here&gt;\\bybox_log.bak'\n\n-- Back up the full bybox database.\nBACKUP DATABASE bybox TO ByBoxData\n\n-- Back up the bybox log.\nBACKUP LOG bybox TO ByBoxLog\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which returned:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Processed 151800 pages for database 'bybox', file 'ByBox_Data' on file 3.\nProcessed 12256 pages for database 'bybox', file 'ByBox_Secondary' on file 3.\nProcessed 1 pages for database 'bybox', file 'ByBox_1_Log' on file 3.\nBACKUP DATABASE successfully processed 164057 pages in 35.456 seconds (36.148 MB/sec).\n\nProcessed 2 pages for database 'bybox', file 'ByBox_1_Log' on file 4.\nBACKUP LOG successfully processed 2 pages in 0.056 seconds (0.252 MB/sec).\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Perfect!

However, my database is in good working order, which leads me to think there is a bug <em>(shudders at the thought)</em>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2008","sql-server-express"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2682,"score":0,"question_id":7313103,"title":"create table permission denied in database 'master'","body":"<p>I have installed the free version of sql server 2008 (sql server management studio express edition) on my PC.

And I want to query these articles based on these 4 columns, but the catch is to pass the multiple values for these columns NOT just one value per column.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008","pivot"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":105,"score":-1,"question_id":12989306,"title":"SQL Server row values as column names Pivot Table?","body":"<p>I have the following view in SQL Server 2008.</p>\n\n<pre><code>DEPT | EMP_ID | EMP_NAME | P_DATE  | HOURS_WORKED\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want the view to be this way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DEPT | EMP_ID | EMP_NAME | 2012-09-28 | 2012-09-29 | 2012-09-30 | 2012-10-01 ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the above date column header is P_DATE below which is \"Hours_Worked\" values of that employee on that particular date.</p>\n\n<p>Like</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-09-28\n\n09:00:00\n\n10:00:00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not sure whether I could achieve it using Pivot.</p>\n\n<p>Please go to this link for clear understanding : <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/82eSo\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"SQL Server view images\">SQL Server View Snapshots</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2008","stored-procedures"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12984830,"title":"Stored procedure to delete from 3 tables","body":"<p>I'm creating an album and image gallery as a feature for a directory.

It was mostly with regard to reducing code repetition for transaction management, error handling, and security. But I have researched it since and cannot find it anywhere. Perhaps I don't know what it is called so I will explain.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I have a simple table (forget its relationships, just a single table). I have at least 5 possible operations I can do on it namely CRUD, with the R being read the details of one row, or read a list of rows for a given criteria. Again, let's not get into too much detail with complicated stored procedures and let's pretend, for this example, we want nothing but the following 5 operations to be performed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create (simple insert)</li>\n<li>Read (one for reading a single row)</li>\n<li>Read multiple (reading a list of rows, simple <code>select * from sometable where some condition</code>, nothing complicated), </li>\n<li>Update (simple update)</li>\n<li>Delete (again, simple delete). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this example, a simple table with 2 or 3 columns, and the most simple procedures you can come up with to do those operations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>My lecturer, when talking to us about transactions, advised us to take these simple procedures, and keep them separate as is normal. But then to write a master procedure which executes each of these. This means we have a master procedure into which we pass a character lets say 'C' for create and so on, and a series of conditions which decide which job to run. Of course, we should pass in the details needed from the master to the child proc which means we need to get them from the user as parameters. This master procedure is already beginning to sound complicated.</p>\n\n<p>His reasoning, do the transaction handling, validation, error handling, and security handling in the master procedure. Then call that master procedure with the required parameters, which does all the checking, and passes the parameters to the child procedure. Below is an example.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nnSly.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Simple table, don't go worrying too much about relationships, keys, indexes, constraints, triggers and so on.</p>\n\n<p>For the below two pieces of code, the only real relevant bit is the parts between the try...catch. The rest is boiler plate for the master.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the code for a create procedure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ALTER proc [Actions].[AreaCreate]\n--External Variables - Input\n@AreaName varchar(50),  @AreaAvailablity bit,   @Description varchar(max),\n\n--External Variables - Output\n@NoOfRecords int output\n\nas\n--Internal Variables\ndeclare @ErrorMessage varchar(max)\n\nBegin try\n    insert  [Tennis3rdYrMVC].[dbo].Areas\n            ([AreaName],    [AreaAvailablity],  [Description])\n    values  (@AreaName,     @AreaAvailablity,   @Description)\n\n    --Show # of records affected so you can detect nulls or empty lists\n    --and handle them as you choose in the code\n    set     @NoOfRecords = @@ROWCOUNT\nEnd try\nBegin Catch\n    set @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE()\n    raiserror(@ErrorMessage,16,1)\n    return ERROR_NUMBER()\nEnd Catch\n\n--All Ok\nreturn 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Below is another piece of code for a delete procedure</p>\n\n<pre><code>ALTER proc [Actions].[AreaDelete]\n--External Variables - Input\n@Id int,\n\n--External Variables - Output\n@NoOfRecords int output\n\nas\n--Internal Variables\ndeclare @ErrorMessage varchar(max)\n\nbegin try\n    delete from [Tennis3rdYrMVC].[dbo].Areas\n    where Id = @Id\n\n    --Show # of records affected so you can detect nulls or empty lists\n    --and handle them as you choose in the code\n    set @NoOfRecords=@@ROWCOUNT\nend try\nbegin catch\n    set @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE()\n    raiserror(@ErrorMessage,16,1)\n    return ERROR_NUMBER()\nend catch\n\n--All Ok\nreturn 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, the suggested, and complicated master proc.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ALTER proc [Admin].[AreaMaster]\n--External Variables - Input\n@JobType int, -- 1=Create, 2=Read 1, 3=Read Many, 4=Update, 5=Delete\n--Master sprock uses null defaults because not every job requires every field to be present.\n--i.e. We dont need to know the area name of an area we want to delete.\n@Id int                 = null,     @AreaName varchar(50)       = null,\n@AreaAvailablity bit    = null,     @Description varchar(max)   = null,\n\n--External Variables - Output\n@NoOfRecords int = null output --Used to count the number of records affected where needed.\nas\nBEGIN\n    --Internal Variables\n    declare @ErrorMessage varchar(max)\n    declare @return_value int\n\n    -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to reduce network traffic and speed things up a little.\n    SET NOCOUNT ON;\n\n    /*\n    --VALIDATION\n\n    --Logic for ensuring all required values are entered should be done in processing below in\n    --the master sprock, NOT in the children (i.e. why check for valid id in 5 sprocks when you\n    --can do it here in one).\n\n\n    We will do all the processing needed to ensure valid and required values are entered where\n    needed.\n\n    --SECURITY\n    This is also where we put the security code required to stop SQL Injection and other\n    attacks, NOT in the child sprocks.

Now imagine another level which if you have several tables to operate on, will decide which sub master to call, and this MasterMaster for want of a better name must have external parameters for every field in every table. However, the validation, security, and transaction code would be moved up to that level instead.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, is that the way a professional would do it. And finally, I am using MVC with entity framework. Suppose I have a database like this (I have), and access is only allowed through this master stored procedure (it is). How do I call such a stored procedure from within EF and MVC. Even better, how would I bypass EF all together and get the data into my controller in a way my view will understand. I know how to do this with ASP.Net code behind. But not in MVC.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions. Please, feel free to tell me that this is completely crazy as it seems like a hell of a lot of work (what if you have 50 tables (I do). Imagine, 5 simple operations, across 50 tables = 250 child stored procedures + 50 Sub-Sub-Masters, + 5 Sub-Masters + 1 Master. I have my work cut out. Is there a tool that can do this or at least generate a template for me?</p>\n\n<p>So to summarise, My questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this overly complicated or is this the professional way to do this?</li>\n<li>What is the term used to describe this Master / child procedural relationship.</li>\n<li>Is there a tool that can automate this process.</li>\n<li>Is there a tool that can help me generate some kind of boilerplate template.</li>\n<li>How can I use this procedure with EF and MVC</li>\n<li>How can I bypass EF altogether and just find a way to call the procedure directly.</li>\n<li>Is there anything like the equivalent of classes, or even methods in T-SQL which can structure this much like a standard piece of code. Meaning that each child procedure is a method, each table has its properties, and the constructor will be the the initial (or altered) representation of the object.</li>\n<li>If 7 does exist, which would be more standard, the way I described (i.e.) splitting everything up, or the idea in 7.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With regard to this point 4 I am talking about something simple, like the one already in SQL Server where you right click a procedure and choose execute and it generates some simple code for testing your procedure, or like the one for making functions.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this and for any help you can offer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linq","sql-server-2008","auto-increment"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12980555,"title":"Auto increment in SQL Server while using linq","body":"<p>I want to update three fields/columns in my database table.

I changed from Windows Authentication Mode by right clicking on the server JACOB=PC\\SQLEXPRESS->Properties->Secuity and changing from Windows Authentication Mode to SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode.  </p>\n\n<p>I then created a new login by right clicking on the Login folder in the window explorer under JACOB-PC/SQLEXPRESS->Secuity Folder->Logins Folder and added a new login.  I gave it the name jhaip2, switched to SQL Server authentication and the set the password to jacob.  Enforce password policy and enforce password expiration are unchecked.  The default database is set to TestDB1.  Then under TestDB1->Secuity->Users->jhaip2->Database role membership I set jhaip2 to db_owner (I couldn't log in to the database in the management studio without doing this, probably not the right thing to do?).  I then restarted the server.</p>\n\n<p>Now for my java code, it is basically a direct copy of the JDBC Driver 3.0 Sample code except without windows authentication.</p>\n\n<pre><code>package databasetest1;\n\nimport java.sql.*;\n\npublic class connectURL {\n\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n      // Create a variable for the connection string.\n      String connectionUrl = \"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;\" + \"databaseName=TestDB1;\";\n\n      // Declare the JDBC objects.\n      Connection con = null;\n      Statement stmt = null;\n      ResultSet rs = null;\n\n      try {\n         // Establish the connection.\n         Class.forName(\"com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver\");\n         System.out.println(\"Driver okay\");\n         con = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl,\"jhaip2\",\"jacob\");\n         System.out.println(\"Connection Made\");\n\n      }\n\n      // Handle any errors that may have occurred.\n      catch (Exception e) {\n         e.printStackTrace();\n      }\n      finally {\n         if (rs != null) try { rs.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n         if (stmt != null) try { stmt.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n         if (con != null) try { con.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run, it prints out \"Driver okay\" so I am assuming my driver is set up correctly.  Then it prints the error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Login failed for user 'jhaip2'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It does not matter what username I use, it always fails.  I have a feeling I am setting up the user wrong.  If anyone could give me some help on how to properly set up a user or any guidance in how to simply connect to a SQL Server database in Java, I would appreciate it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","sql-server-2008","tsql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12982277,"title":"condensing a dataset on nulls","body":"<p>My query returns a table that looks like this (please note that I am posting a very simplified version of the output):</p>\n\n<pre><code>+-------+------+------+------+------+\n|       |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |\n+-------+------+------+------+------+\n| 14234 | 3    | null | null | null |\n| 14234 | null | null | 32   | null |\n| 33334 | 4    | null | null | 5    |\n| 33334 | null | 3    | null | null |\n+-------+------+------+------+------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and i would like to reformat it to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+-------+---+------+------+------+\n|       | 1 |  2   |  3   |  4   |\n+-------+---+------+------+------+\n| 14234 | 3 | null | 32   | null |\n| 33334 | 4 | 3    | null | 5    |\n+-------+---+------+------+------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>as you can see the rows have been put together (condensed), i don't know what the right terminology would be. </p>\n\n<p>is there a quick way to do this with sql server?</p>\n\n<p>here's the original query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>;WITH \nPivotQuery as (\n    select client_id,\n       [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]\n       from\n       (   SELECT DISTINCT CLIENT_ID\n       , PATIENT_ID\n       , count(*) over (partition by client_id, patient_id) AS patientcount\n\n       from f_accession_daily) as SourceTable\n       PIVOT\n       (\n       count(patient_id)\n       for patientcount in ([1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7])\n       ) as pivottable),\n\nMinMaxTimes as (\n    SELECT a.client_id AS client_id\n    ,a.patientcount TimesTested\n       , count(a.patientcount)/a.patientcount AS count\n       , max(f.received_date) AS maxRecDate\n       , min(f.received_date) AS minRecDate\n    FROM\n    (\n       SELECT DISTINCT CLIENT_ID\n       , PATIENT_ID\n       , count(*) over (partition by client_id, patient_id) AS patientcount\n\n       from f_accession_daily\n\n    ) AS a\n    JOIN F_ACCESSION_DAILY AS f ON a.CLIENT_ID = f.CLIENT_ID\n       AND a.PATIENT_ID = f.PATIENT_ID\n\n    GROUP BY a.CLIENT_ID, a.patientcount),\n\nmaxDates as (\nSELECT client_id, [1] maxdate1, [2] maxdate2, [3] maxdate3, [4] maxdate4, [5] maxdate5, [6] maxdate6, [7] maxdate7\nFROM MinMaxTimes t\nPIVOT (max(maxRecDate)\nfor TimesTested IN ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7])\n) as p),\n\nminDates as (\nSELECT client_id, [1] mindate1, [2] mindate2, [3] mindate3, [4] mindate4, [5] mindate5, [6] mindate6, [7] mindate7\nFROM MinMaxTimes t\nPIVOT (max(minRecDate)\nfor TimesTested IN ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7])\n) as p)\n\nSELECT i.client_id, \n    p.[1], maxdate1, mindate1, \n    p.[2], maxdate2, mindate2, \n    p.[3], maxdate3, mindate3, \n    p.[4], maxdate4, mindate4, \n    p.[5], maxdate5, mindate5, \n    p.[6], maxdate6, mindate6, \n    p.[7], maxdate7, mindate7   \nFROM PivotQuery p\nLEFT OUTER JOIN maxDates a ON p.client_id = a.client_id\nLEFT OUTER JOIN mindates i ON a.client_id = i.client_id\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2008","tsql"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":67,"score":0,"question_id":12981816,"title":"What does a select statement inside a select statement mean?","body":"<p>What does a Transact SQL statement <code>Select</code> statement inside a <code>from</code> mean? </p>\n\n<p>I mean something like this </p>\n\n<pre><code> .. from ( \n    select .. \n )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, I need to know if the statement is bad for performance.

We tried to use \"Specific Version\"=false, but since this is a \"Strong Name\" assembly it doesn't work as one would think.</p>\n\n<p>The relevant link which I found is this:<br>\n<a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqlanalysisservices/thread/47d0b992-3c10-4851-b2a5-9f72d2c0976e\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqlanalysisservices/thread/47d0b992-3c10-4851-b2a5-9f72d2c0976e</a></p>\n\n<p>Can someone please direct me to a link for solving this issue?</p>\n\n<p>Update: I guess I didn't test it correctly since it doesn't work for other servers in SQLServer2008 R2. I guess you can't use range in the newVersion element. So the question is still opened for everyone! . Bottom line is that I know that I have version 9.0.242.0 but the customers version may be either 9.0.242.0 or 10.0.0.0. Is there a method which I can dynamically choose the correct assembly on the production server</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server-2008"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":2,"question_id":12961562,"title":"SQL Server : using elements in a case statement that might be NULL","body":"<p>Okay, so I have a question about using columns in a case statement that might be null.</p>\n\n<p>Again I have two tables the first looks like this <code>UserActivity</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   userID    Action    Time\n     1         25       12:00\n     1         10       12:01\n     1         12       12:35\n     1          6       13:54\n     2         10        6:47\n     2         42        6:48\n     3          8       11:54\n     etc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the second now looks like this <code>UserSchedule</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   userID      startTime1        stopTime1     startTime2    stoptime2  startTime3    stopTime3\n     1            07:00            09:00         11:00         12:00       14:30         16:30\n     2            11:00            12:30         14:00         15:30       \n     3            14:00            15:00\n    etc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I need to be able to evaluate when in relation to all of those start and stop times an Action took place.

It's using <code>ApplicationPoolIdentity</code> as a security context.</li>\n<li>It is not possible to easily modify web application code (particularly the way it accesses database)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When my web application tries to connect to database it either succeeds or fails, depending on whether user <code>IIS APPPOOL\\PortalAppPool</code> is configured in MSSQL database. That's a part which I understand, but when deploying my app I often forget to create new user/login in db for apppool virtual account. So what I want to do, is to verify from separate, standalone, console app (preferably written in C#, but not necessarily), whether my web application can access database, in following way:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read connection string from <code>Web.config</code></li>\n<li>Read app pool identity settings (managed to do this by Directory Services API)</li>\n<li>Impersonate identity with credentials defined on app pool (using impersonation class I found here: <a href=\"http://platinumdogs.me/2008/10/30/net-c-impersonation-with-network-credentials/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://platinumdogs.me/2008/10/30/net-c-impersonation-with-network-credentials/</a> which uses ideas found in many other places, including MSDN)</li>\n<li>Open <code>SqlConnection</code> with connection string read from <code>Web.config</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It boils down to following snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using (new Impersonator(\"IIS APPPOOL\\\\PortalAppPool\", \"\", \"\"))\n{\n    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(databaseConnectString);\n    conn.Open();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works very well, when my app pool security context is set to any other value than <code>AppPoolIdentity</code> - specific user, local system, etc. When I change credentials passed to <code>Impersonator</code> to my user's name and password, I get desired result (exception when I have no login mapping in database, and everything is OK when I add one). But I just seem to not be able to impersonate <code>IIS APPPOOLS\\PortalAppPool</code> virtual account - just have no idea what parameters should be passed to <code>LogonUser</code> - I would not be surprised if it would not be even possible. Maybe I am focused on impersonation approach too much (I am using it to access registry keys and services of other users and it works good), and maybe there is some better way.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any other, better ideas, or need some more explanation to this problem, please let me know.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server-2008"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12955714,"title":"How to modify an SQL query with sub query to get an extra column","body":"<p>I am trying to modify a user query in order to return an extra column, INV1.WhsCode from the following SQL query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT  T0.CardCode,\n        T2.CardName,\n        T0.CodeBars,\n        T0.ItemCode,\n        T0.ItemName,\n        T3.Price AS [POS Price],\n        T1.AvgPrice,\n        T1.OnHand,\n        T1.MinStock,\n        T1.MaxStock,\n        T0.NumInBuy AS Packsize,\n        T0.LstSalDate,\n        (\n            SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS Expr1\n            FROM dbo.INV1\n            INNER JOIN OINV\n                    ON INV1.DocEntry = OINV.DocEntry\n            WHERE INV1.ItemCode = T0.ItemCode\n                    AND INV1.WhsCode = [%2]\n                    AND Month(OINV.DocDate) = month(GetDate())\n        ) AS [Current Period],\n        (\n            SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS Expr1\n            FROM dbo.INV1\n            INNER JOIN OINV\n                    ON INV1.DocEntry = OINV.DocEntry\n            WHERE INV1.ItemCode = T0.ItemCode\n                    AND INV1.WhsCode = [%2]\n                    AND Month(OINV.DocDate) = month(GetDate()) - 1\n        ) AS [Previous Period],\n        (\n            SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS Expr1\n            FROM dbo.INV1\n            INNER JOIN OINV\n                    ON INV1.DocEntry = OINV.DocEntry\n            WHERE INV1.ItemCode = T0.ItemCode\n                    AND INV1.WhsCode = [%2]\n                    AND Month(OINV.DocDate) = month(GetDate()) - 2\n        ) AS [60-90],\n        (\n            SELECT TOP 1 OPDN.DocDate AS Expr1\n            FROM dbo.PDN1\n            INNER JOIN OPDN\n                    ON PDN1.DocEntry = OPDN.DocEntry\n            WHERE PDN1.ItemCode = T0.ItemCode\n            ORDER BY OPDN.DocDate DESC\n        ) AS LastGRNDate\nFROM    OITM T0\n        INNER JOIN OITW T1\n            ON T0.ItemCode = T1.ItemCode\n        INNER JOIN OCRD T2\n            ON T0.CardCode = T2.CardCode\n        INNER JOIN ITM1 T3\n            ON T0.ItemCode = T3.ItemCode\n        INNER JOIN OWHS T4\n            ON T1.WhsCode = T4.WhsCode\n        INNER JOIN OITB T5\n            ON T0.ItmsGrpCod = T5.ItmsGrpCod\nWHERE   T3.PriceList = '3'\n        AND T4.WhsName = [%0]\n        AND T5.ItmsGrpNam = [%1]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I achieve this?
