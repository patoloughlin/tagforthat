The main key here is that this is for an iOS application. What I want is to quickly communicate from one device to another device updates. So if user 1 performs an action, I want to, in real time, tell user 2 that user 1 has performed this action.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to use Apple Push Notifications for various reasons. So that's out of the question. I looked into services like Pusher and PubNub, but those are far too expensive (and only allow a ridiculously low number of concurrent connections, ~2500). I also looked into Google App Engine's Channel API, but it works through Javascript, and would have to be implemented using shady techniques on iOS. And honestly I'd rather not use that.</p>\n\n<p>So now I'm looking into XMPP in Google App Engine. It seems like it would do what I want, but I'm not sure if I'm understanding the whole picture. Couldn't I accomplish what I wanted using XMPP messages, that is when user 1 performs an action, I can notify user 2 quickly with a JSON message?</p>\n\n<p>The main key here is that I would have to perform user registration for XMPP behind the scenes, using the user's unique ID.

The crucial unit tests in my worldview are extremely lightweight and fast ones, ones that run in an extremely short time, so I can keep running them over and over all the time without breaking my development rhythm (e.g., for a different project, I get 97% or so coverage for a 20K-lines project with several dozens of super-fast tests that take 5-7 seconds, elapsed time, for a typical run, overall -- that's what I consider a decent suite of small, fast unit-tests).  I'll have richer/heavier tests as well of course, all the way to integration tests with selenium or windmill, that's <strong>not</strong> what I'm asking about;-) -- my focus in this question (and in most of my development endeavors;-) is on the small, lightweight unit-tests that lightly and super-rapidly cover my code, not on the deeper ones.</p>\n\n<p>So I think what I need is essentially a set of small, very lightweight simulations of the various key App Engine subsystems -- data store, memcache, request/response objects and calls to webapp handlers, user handling, mail, &amp;c, roughly in this order of priority.  I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for, so it seems to me that I should either rely on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pymox/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mox</a>, as I've done often in the past, which basically means mocking each subsystem used in a given test and setting up all expectations &amp;c (strong, but lots of work each time, and very sensitive to the tested-code's internals, i.e. very \"white-box\"y), or rolling my own simulation of each subsystem (and doing asserts on the simulated subsystems' states as part of the unit tests). The latters seems feasible, given GAE's Python-side strong \"stubs\" architecture... but I can't believe I need to roll my own, i.e., that nobody's already written such simple-minded simulators!-)  E.g., for the datastore, it looks like what I need is more or less the \"datastore on file\" stub that's already part of the SDK, plus a way to mark it readonly and easy-to-use accessors for assertions about the datastore's state; and so forth, subsystem by subsystem -- each seems to need \"just a bit more\" than what's already in the SDK, \"perched on top\" of the existing \"stubs\" architecture.</p>\n\n<p>So, before diving in and spending a day or two of precious development time \"rolling my own\" simulations of GAE subsystems for unit testing purposes, I thought I'd double check with the SO crowd and see what y'all think of this... or, if there's already some existing open source set of such simulators that I can simply reuse (or minimally tweak!-), and which I've just failed to spot in my searching!-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: to clarify, if I do roll my own, I do plan to leverage the SDK-supplied stubs where feasible; but for example there's no stub for a datastore that gets initially read in from a file but then not saved at the end, so I need to subclass and tweak the existing one (which also doesn't offer particularly convenient ways to do asserts on its state -- same for the mail service stub, etc). That's what I mean by \"rolling my own\" -- not \"rewriting from scratch\"!-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: \"why not GAEUnit\" -- GAEUnit is nice for its own use cases, but running dev_appserver and seeing results in my browser (or even via urllib.urlopen) is definitely not what I'm after -- I want to use a fully automated setup, suitable for running within an existing test-running framework which is based on extending unittest, and no HTTP in the way (said framework defines a \"fast\" test as one that among other thing does no sockets and minimal disk I/O -- we simulate or mock these -- so via gaeunit I could do no better than \"medium\" tests) + no convenient way to prepopulate datastore for each test (and no OO structure to help customize things).</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","blobstore","google-cloud-storage"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":490,"score":3,"question_id":7753840,"title":"If you're storing an image Blob in App Engine, should you put it in the Blobstore or Google Cloud Storage?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/storage/docs/getting-started.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Cloud Storage</a> seems more cost effective than the <strong>App Engine Blobstore</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment I am storing user-uploaded image files as <code>Blob</code> type fields in the <strong>Datastore</strong> (App Engine Java API, by the way). </p>\n\n<p>But I'm debating whether to switch to either the <strong>Blobstore</strong> or <strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> to permit image sizes greater than 1MB.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> seems more cost-effective than <strong>Blobstore</strong>.

I have been able to import the Items to an excel spreadsheet. but it imports every thing on the webpage. and i would like to be able to have seperate sprreadsheets for each type of item and have the spread sheet update automaticly. so i went to the google data api. an the problem there is that facebook wont let my google spreadsheet script access anything it redirects me to the login page(or atleast that is what i suspect because when i run the debug it shows the a redirected url). then i read about how javascript does not work coss domain.<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9284768/cross-domain-javascript\">cross domain javascript</a>. and sience google spript is java based i thought that that might be the problem. so I went to scraperwiki<a href=\"https://scraperwiki.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://scraperwiki.com/</a> and created a spript there in php thinking that would solve the problem. Now i should mention that i have tested if i can access this page without being loged into facebook (meaning i logged out of facebook and called the site and i was able to pull the site up in the browser and use a java shell to get the data i wanted. then when i click another link that requirs me to belogged into facebook the login screen would show up i would click the bookmark to the page i want to get the data from and i can see it and get the data from javashell.) </p>\n\n<p>So after that long story my questions are\n1. will oauth solve this road block?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>if i created a FB app would i be able to get the data i wanted and then be able to get it to the google spreadsheet?</p></li>\n<li><p>would something like Watin <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/watin\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/watin</a> be a better way?

Right now I have a AppEngine class (which contains all the server side information) and a class in the shared directory that the client uses (and gets passed between RPC calls).  Now I need methods that convert between the two, and reproduce methods needed on the server and the client.  This has be come a headache and I see bugs being prone when the class get more complicated.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I didn't just make one shared class is that I didn't want to expose some of my server said logic, methods and attributes to the client.  But I was reading that when GWT compiles it drops unused methods, and attributes from the compiled code.  Is this true, and will this protect the code that I don't want to be seen on the client?  Are there any gotchas I should be aware of?  Attributes are less of a worry (I think) since it'll obfuscate the names.  I know I can use the transient keyword so server data doesn't get sent to the client in RPC calls.</p>\n\n<p>What would be best is an annotation I can put on methods that lets the GWT compiler know that it should never compile this method, that way I know it will never make it in to the compiled javascript.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly if I keep the code separated is there a best practice for cases like this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine","data-export"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13195380,"title":"Get all entities from Google App Engine","body":"<p>Can I get all entities from Google App Engine using API for Java?

We thought the issues had to do with quota errors we were running into so we switched our application from a free to a paid app and we still have problems.  </p>\n\n<p>Each time we are attempting to back up to the blobstore and what occurs is that the process never finishes.  We see the backup in our Pending Backups list but it never actually completes.  We only have a total of 43MB of data right now so we don't see it as a data transfer problem.  Looking at our default Task Queues it shows that we have two pending tasks one is a call to  /_ah/mapreduce/controller_callback and another is a call to  /_ah/mapreduce/worker_callback</p>\n\n<p>The worker_callback racks up its retry count and the only error clue we have is on the Previous Run tab it shows the last http response code to be 500.  There is no error message, nothing shows up in our error logs, it just keeps trying over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>We've been able to narrow the backup problems to a specific entity kind for a particular namespace but we can't figure out why that entity kind is failing whereas the others are not.  The major difference is the entity kind has a large number of embedded entities, but if the app engine is able to read / put those entities we can't understand why it seems to be having problems backing it up.  The particular namespace that the error occurs in has the largest data stored for that entity kind compared to the other namespaces we have setup.</p>\n\n<p>We think if we can see what error is occurring in the worker_callback we may be able to figure out why the backup is failing, or what is wrong with our data that's preventing the backup. Is there something we need to setup / enable through settings / configuration files to give us more detailed information on the backup?  Or is there some other avenue we should explore to figure out how to investigate/fix this problem?</p>\n\n<p>I should mention we are using the Java SDK as well as Objectify V3 to work with the data store.

From <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/usingjsps\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page on using JSPs</a>, it looks like GAE is expecting a normal, <code>HttpServlet</code>-based web app, with the typical handlers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {\n        // Handle the HTTP request here and return a response\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After reading the GWT documentation and watching several Google I/O videos, I am confident that I want to use GWT's <code>RequestFactory</code> option instead of the traditional GWT-RPC method for client-server communication.</p>\n\n<p>In researching examples of how to use <code>RequestFactory</code>, I found <a href=\"http://cleancodematters.com/2011/06/04/tutorial-gwt-request-factory-part-i/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this simple example</a> which proposes the following class architecture:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Client-Side:\n    PizzaProxy - client-side proxy for Pizza.class\n    PizzaRequestFactory - RF impl\n    PizzaRequestContext - RF context impl\n\nServer-Side:\n    Pizza - the entity\n    PizzaDao - DAO for entity\n    DaoLocator - ServiceLocator for all DAOs\n    PizzaLocator - Locator for entity\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For one, I'd say I was a little surprised to see the code this normalized, but don't mind this kind of an architecture for each entity if it pays off in performance or just provides the usualy benefit of good old fashioned clean code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most importantly, I'm not seeing the connection between what GAE wants and what this <code>RequestFactory</code> seems to provide (on the server-side).</strong> In other words, I see an example of <code>RequestFactory</code> server-side code sans any kind of <code>HttpServlet</code> whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask: how can I \"wire\" these two (<code>RequestFactory</code> and <code>HttpServlet</code>) concepts up so that the GWT client app can send HTTP/S to the GAE backend, which is servlet-driven? Is there a way to keep the architecture proposed in the \"Pizza App\" above, or is there a different architecture/approach needed when deploying to GAE?</p>\n\n<p>In fact, come to think of it, this problem would apply not only to GAE, but any standard Java web container: Tomcat, JBoss, Jetty...</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I just found the code samples for <a href=\"http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.6/com/google/gwt/http/client/package-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">GWT's Request Framework</a> and it seems like this <em>might</em> be what I'm looking for. However, this doesn't appear to have anything to do with <code>RequestFactory</code>, so I'm a little confused/concerned that if I go with the classes in that link that I'll lose the benefits that come with <code>RequestFactory</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine","upload","blobstore","chunked-encoding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":13127500,"title":"Does AppEngine BlobStore support Chunked Transfer Encoding for uploads (Status 411: Length required)?","body":"<p>I'm having a really hard time finding documentation on a very basic question about AppEngine:</p>\n\n<p>Does the BlobStore support Chunked Transfer Encoding for uploads?</p>\n\n<p>I'm using an HttpURLConnection object in Java with setChunkedStreamingMode to upload a file in a multipart/form-data type request using the following code to set up the connection:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpURLConnection cxn = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(uploadUrl).openConnection();\ncxn.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\ncxn.setChunkedStreamingMode(9999);\ncxn.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart/form-data; boundary=-\");\ncxn.setDoOutput(true);\ncxn.connect();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The dev-server answers my request with Status 411: Length required.

What I need the most is a scalable database solution. Before discovering Google AppEngine, the only three DB solutions I find useful are DynamoDB, MongoDb and BigCouch. </p>\n\n<p>I find out how that I really like python language, and for one coming from ASP.NET development, I've decided to switch and develop my app using python. My first choice was to develop my application using python + bottle + mongoDB.  The problem is that DynamoDB is very expensive, and the lack of easy to use backup/restore options made me pass Amazon's offering.</p>\n\n<p>Google AppEngine datastore is much more affordable. However, I still can't find information regarding some specific question on Google's website</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the questions I need answer to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Does Google Datastore support backup/restore within the administration console?</li>\n<li>If I want to backup/restore 50TB of data, how much time it takes to backup/restore the data? Where it is stored? what are the costs?</li>\n<li>How much time it takes to backup 1TB of data for example?</li>\n<li>Does DataStore support caching in the database layer</li>\n<li>Any cons that I should be aware of?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those some of the question that I need to get answers to. MongoDB is an excellent product and developing web app using Mongo + Python + bottle is fun fun fun. However, I prefer a full DB hosted solution like one offered by Google.

I need Company to be able to express itself as a JSON string, and it does not know about the other classes (Office and Region) that reference it.  This works for the normal properties:</p>\n\n<pre><code>c = Company(name='A Company',address='123 Main St, New York, NY 12345')\nc.put()\n\ndallas = Office(name='Dallas',company=c)\ndallas.put()\n\nny = Office(name='New York',company=c)\nny.put()\n\nnortheast = Region(name='NorthEast',company=c)\nnortheast.put()\n\nsouthwest = Region(name='SouthWest',company=c)\nsouthwest.put()\n\nlogging.info('Company as JSON: %s' % c.to_JSON())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And what I get for output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"name\": \"A Company\", \"address\": \"123 Main St, New York, NY 12345\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So properties() includes the properties of the entity as expected, but I also want to include the back-references from the ReferenceProperty attributes of the associated objects.  Essentially what I'm looking for is just a list of the back-reference (collection_name) names, since I know they represent queries, but I can't find any way to enumerate the back-reference names themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Remember this code isn't actually indicative of the real code, it's greatly simplified.  Now this works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>offices = getattr(company, 'offices')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what I was expecting to see was this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"name\": \"A Company\", \"address\": \"123 Main St, New York, NY 12345\", \n \"offices\": \"&lt;db.Query object at 0x110e992d0&gt;\", \n \"regions\": \"&lt;db.Query object at 0x110e99300&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't actually <em>need</em> the back-references \"offices\" and \"regions\" to be included in the properties() enumerations, but they're checked for uniqueness somehow (I couldn't, for example, also have a StringProperty in Company named 'offices') so there must be a way to enumerate them.

Since I started using GAE a few months ago, I've always shrugged off memcache as not useful and an uncessessary hassle, that it's really not that important. But it seems that memcache is praised as a highly beneficial feature, that Google even says \"High performance scalable web applications often use a distributed in-memory data cache in front of or in place of robust persistent storage for some tasks.\", and so I thought that there must be something worth looking into about this. </p>\n\n<p>I just don't get it. How is it good for performance? First you have to check if something is in memcache, and if not, query. I always thought it would just be quicker to not have to deal with that, and just query anyway, but it seems this may be a naive approach? How much of a difference does this make?</p>\n\n<p>I guess what I never understood is where memcache is useful. I can see how it can be useful in say the Stackoverflow home page, where all users pretty much see the same thing, so it would be useful, in fact silly not to use memcache in a situation like that. But say a social network like Facebook. Every user sees something different. No two people see the same data and content, and things change so fast that memcache would probably constantly need to be updated. What role can memcache play in such a scenario?</p>\n\n<p>Also, in a private website like a social network, how much can memcache really fit if every user has to store different information in memcache? I know GAE doesn't speak of the size of its memcache, so would it be safe to store hundreds of thousands of records?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","google-app-engine","memcached"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":833,"score":2,"question_id":2512571,"title":"Idiots guide to app engine and memcache","body":"<p>I am struggling to find a good tutorial or best practices document for the use of memcache in app engine.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm pretty happy with it on the level presented in the docs.

It would have been nice to know this in advance, and the many other things that I'm having to find out along the way, and which I implement without being sure if I'm supposed to be doing that.</li>\n<li>And some more...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My biggest problem is that Social login is not working, and I feel this boilerplate is a big monster with which I don't know where to start. To make things worse, it is hard to debug social auth from any machine that is not the production one. Thats why I'm desperately looking for some docs.</p>\n\n<p>I have not found anything in SO, and I guess there must be more people in my situation. So, any pointers to documentation that could help to understand gae-boilerplate a little bit better would be very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I switched to gae-boilerplate in a site that I had previously working. Maybe most of my problems come from the way that I have tried to integrate gae-boilerplate and my existing site. As a result I have tried to treat gae-boilerplate as a library, and keep my own templates, handlers, static files and such.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you guys!</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","gwt","eclipse-plugin","google-cloud-sql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":169,"score":0,"question_id":11376142,"title":"Google Cloud SQL configuration - get OAuth 2 token via GoogleCL for SQL or Eclipse","body":"<p>Configuring Google Cloud SQL to work with an app built using GWT Eclipse EE Plugin and am having authentication issues.</p>\n\n<h3>Google Command Line Tool - try running ./google_sql.sh <em>instance</em></h3>\n\n<p>Need guidance setting up GoogleCL for CloudSQL.

Currently, here's what I have (it's really simple, I promise):</p>\n\n<p>You have a Class (Class meaning Classroom not a programming \"class\") model and an Assignment model and also a User model. Now, a Class has an integer list property called memberIds, which is an indexed list of User ids. A class also has a string list of Assignment ids. </p>\n\n<p>Anytime a new Assignment is created, its respective Class entity is also updated and adds the new Assignment id to its list. </p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is get new Assignments for a user. What I do is <strong>query</strong> for all Classes where <code>memberId = currentUserId</code>. Each Class I get back has a list of assignment ids. I use those ids to get their respective Assignments by key. After months with this data model, I just realized that I might not get strong consistency with this (for the Class query part). </p>\n\n<p>If user A posts an assignment (which consequently updates ClassA), user B who checks in for new assignments a fraction of a second later might not yet see the updated changes to ClassA (right?).</p>\n\n<p>This is undesired. One solution would be to user ancestor queries, but that is not possible in my case, and entity groups are limited to 1 write per second, and I'm not sure if that's enough for my case.</p>\n\n<p>So here's what I figured: anytime a new assignment is posted, we do this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get the respective Class entity</li>\n<li>add the assignment id to the Class</li>\n<li>get the ids of all this Class's members</li>\n<li>fetch all users who are members, by keys</li>\n<li>a User entity has a list of Classes that the user is a member of. (A LocalStructuredProperty, sort of like a dictionary:{\"classId\" : \"242\", \"hasNewAssignment\" : \"Yes\"} ). We flag that class as <code>hasNewAssignment =\nYES</code></li>\n<li>Now when a user wants to get new assignments, instead of <strong>querying</strong> for groups that have a new assignment and which I am a member of, I\ncheck the User objects list of Classes and check which classes have\nnew assignments.</li>\n<li>I retrieve those classes by key (strongly consistent so far, right?)</li>\n<li>I check the assignments list of the classes and I retrieve all assignments by key.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So throughout this process, I've never queried. All results should be strongly consistent, right? Is this a good solution? Am I overcomplicating things? Are my read/write costs skyrocketing with this?

Below is my code:</p>\n\n<p>This is the code to get all childentities and check if its property \"orgID\" matches or not.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Entity getSingleProfileOrg(Key profileKey, String orgID) {\n\n    Iterable&lt;Entity&gt; childProfileOrgs = Util.listChildren(\"profileOrg\",profileKey);\n\n    for (Entity e : childProfileOrgs) {\n        if (e.getProperty(\"orgID\").toString() == orgID) {\n            return e;\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the code to query datastore.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Iterable&lt;Entity&gt; listChildren(String kind, Key ancestor) {\n  logger.log(Level.INFO, \"Search entities based on parent\");\n  Query query = new Query(kind);\n  query.setAncestor(ancestor);\n  query.addFilter(Entity.KEY_RESERVED_PROPERTY, FilterOperator.GREATER_THAN, ancestor);\n  PreparedQuery pq = datastore.prepare(query);\n  return pq.asIterable();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please help. this has got me stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Code for getting ChildEntities for org which works perfectly</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Entity getSingleContact(Key orgKey, String phoneContactID) {\n    Iterable&lt;Entity&gt; childContacts = Util.listChildren(\"contact\", orgKey);\n\n\n    for (Entity e : childContacts) {\n        if (e.getProperty(\"contactID\") == phoneContactID) {\n            return e;\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Edit: Code to create or update ProfileOrg</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void createOrUpdateProfileOrg(String profileID,\n        String orgName, String ownerID) {\n    String orgID = ownerID + \"_\" + orgName;\n    Entity Profile = Product.getProfile(profileID);\n    //Key profileKey = KeyFactory.createKey(\"Profile\", profileID);\n    Key profileKey = Profile.getKey();\n    Entity profileOrg = getSingleProfileOrg(profileKey, orgID);\n    if (profileOrg == null) {\n        profileOrg = new Entity(\"profileOrg\", profileKey);\n        profileOrg.setProperty(\"name\", orgName);\n        profileOrg.setProperty(\"orgID\", orgID);\n        profileOrg.setProperty(\"owner\", ownerID);\n        profileOrg.setProperty(\"profileID\", profileID);\n        Util.persistEntity(profileOrg);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the line</p>\n\n<pre><code>Entity Profile = Product.getProfile(profileID);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>should be working fine as it is used to create profiles also and i dont see any problem there.</p>\n\n<p>As i always get a null from getSingleProfileOrg(profileKey, orgID); i end up getting duplicate child entities.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine","jsp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":119,"score":0,"question_id":9960940,"title":"Deployed default guestbook - what does major minor mean and how do I fix it?","body":"<p>So when I deployed the default guestbook application I get a server error.

When I push the code out to appspot and try to get it to run the same job, I'm getting what looks like datastore timeouts.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 1536, in __call__\n    rv = self.handle_exception(request, response, e)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 1530, in __call__\n    rv = self.router.dispatch(request, response)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 1278, in default_dispatcher\n    return route.handler_adapter(request, response)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 1102, in __call__\n    return handler.dispatch()\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 572, in dispatch\n    return self.handle_exception(e, self.app.debug)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/third_party/webapp2-2.5.1/webapp2.py\", line 570, in dispatch\n    return method(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/base/data/home/apps/s~myzencoder/dbops.362541511260492787/backend.py\", line 626, in get\n    for asset in assets:\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/ext/db/__init__.py\", line 2314, in next\n    return self.__model_class.from_entity(self.__iterator.next())\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/datastore/datastore_query.py\", line 2816, in next\n    next_batch = self.__batcher.next()\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/datastore/datastore_query.py\", line 2678, in next\n    return self.next_batch(self.AT_LEAST_ONE)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/datastore/datastore_query.py\", line 2715, in next_batch\n    batch = self.__next_batch.get_result()\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/api/apiproxy_stub_map.py\", line 604, in get_result\n    return self.__get_result_hook(self)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/datastore/datastore_query.py\", line 2452, in __query_result_hook\n    self._batch_shared.conn.check_rpc_success(rpc)\n  File \"/base/python27_runtime/python27_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/datastore/datastore_rpc.py\", line 1224, in check_rpc_success\n    raise _ToDatastoreError(err)\nTimeout: The datastore operation timed out, or the data was temporarily unavailable.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyone got any suggestions on how to make this work?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":1,"question_id":12956635,"title":"GAE / Java excessive new process restarts starting yesterday","body":"<p>Apologies if this question does not quite meet stackoverflow standards.\nBut as user of paid instances in GAE, we are being sent here for support.\nSo I am asking an is-it-down-or-is-it-just-me question here.</p>\n\n<p>Starting yesterday, I see excessive process restarts (\"This request caused a new process to be started for your application, and thus caused your application code to be loaded for the first time.\") No changes to settings. </p>\n\n<p>Based on a log review, this started between 2012-10-17 20:09:49 and 20:11:03.

Please check your network connection and try again.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>link to my application is da7x-app.appspot.com</p>\n\n<p>I don't think the problem is in code, because on local server application works correctly. Maybe the solution is quite obvious, but I'm newbie and cannot figure it out. I tried to search for problems like mine and their solutions, but haven't found anything, so any help is appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","google-app-engine","error-handling","thread-safety","element"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":2,"question_id":12563587,"title":"App Engine <threadsafe> element missing error","body":"<p>So I have this error that i've seen many people have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>appengine-web.xml does not contain a &lt;threadsafe&gt; element.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the solution always provided is to just add </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;threadsafe&gt;true&lt;/threadsafe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to the appengine-web.xml file.

I made a simple HasCursor interface, and was going to pass back a List with Cursor in it to the client side - the only problem is RequestFactory can only handle passing certain types from server to client - this Custom type isn't one of them.

So, what I'm wondering is, how do you actually tell the DataGrid that there is more data available on the server.  I'm a little confused as it seems there isn't a whole lot of documentation / examples available for this.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>for anybody else that runs into this problem i found out the answer to one part of it - i forgot all about ValueProxies that allow you to map standard java beans to return to the client side from the server with RequestFactory.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you can't use Generics with ValueProxies so I had to create a ListCursor wrapper for each individual type.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the proxy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@ProxyFor(value = VenueListCursorWrapper.class)\npublic interface VenueListCursorWrapperProxy extends ValueProxy {\n\n  List&lt;VenueProxy&gt; getVenues();\n\n  String getCursor();\n\n  boolean isMoreAvailable();\n\n  void setVenues(List&lt;VenueProxy&gt; venues);\n\n  void setCursor(String cursor);\n\n  void setMoreAvailable(boolean moreAvailable);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and here's the updated method on the server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public VenueListCursorWrapper findPage(Subject subject, Objectify ofy, int pageSize, String cursor) {\n  final Business business = (Business) subject.getSession().getAttribute(BUSINESS_ATTRIBUTE);\n  final Query&lt;Venue&gt; query = ofy.query(Venue.class).filter(BUSINESS_ATTRIBUTE, business);\n  if (cursor != null) {\n    query.startCursor(Cursor.fromWebSafeString(cursor));\n  }\n  final QueryResultIterator&lt;Key&lt;Venue&gt;&gt; iterator = query.fetchKeys().iterator();\n  final List&lt;Key&lt;Venue&gt;&gt; data = new ArrayList&lt;Key&lt;Venue&gt;&gt;(pageSize);\n  boolean more = false;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; pageSize &amp;&amp; (more = iterator.hasNext()); i++) {\n    data.add(iterator.next());\n  }\n  return new VenueListCursorWrapper(get(ofy, data), iterator.getCursor().toWebSafeString(), more);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So - that's that part of it - the one thing I still haven't quite figured out how to do is get the pager set up correctly - I would like to show the total count of items in the pager to allow you to page through it but I'm not sure exactly how to do this yet - if I find a solution I will post it</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","gae-datastore"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12808866,"title":"Storing the Cursor for App Engine Pagination","body":"<p>I'm trying to implement pagination using App Engine's RPC and GWT (it's an app engine connected project). </p>\n\n<p>How can I pass both the query results and the web-safe cursor object to the GWT client from the RPC? </p>\n\n<p>I've seen examples using a servlet but I want to know how to do it without a servelt.</p>\n\n<p>I've considered caching the cursor on the server using memcache but I'm not sure if that's appropriate or what should be used as the key (session identifier I would assume, but I'm not sure how those are handled on App Engine).</p>\n\n<p>Links to example projects would be fantastic, I've been unable to find any.</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","objectify"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12825930,"title":"Error saving entity with Objectify","body":"<p>This is the error when I try to persist an Entity: </p>\n\n<pre><code>com.googlecode.objectify.SaveException: Error saving com.mycomp.simplify.KeyValueVersion@60991f: You cannot create a Key for an object with a null @Id.

In GAE, we can delete the old alias and set the alias up on the new application, but we don't know how long this is going to take to complete (other than the 10 seconds it takes for someone to click the buttons and post to the control panel).

persisting the new flight object, it store it in PMF as a static variable.</p>\n\n<p>So when the list of flights is fetched in a query, it stores the result it the list, and the list is compared with the last added object, if the last added object is not in the list, i manually add the last added object to the list.</p>\n\n<p>However using this method, i get the following exception whenever the newly added object is missing from the list and i manually add it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Oct 6, 2012 2:19:38 PM com.google.apphosting.utils.jetty.JettyLogger warn\nWARNING:

Your help is much appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>I see someone marked this question as \"This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful\". Could this person who voted this step forward and let me know why he/ she believes so? I tested GAE with the sample application. This in turn rules out that the JDK is the problem, which is typically the solution when you get this error. There are hundreds of posts concerning the error message \"com.google.appengine.tools.admin.JspCompilationException: Failed to compile jsp files\" but almost all of them get resolved pointing to the correct JDK. This in turn means that this particular problem here appears to be specific to Liferay, which I know is not officially supported to deployable on GAE. However this is because no one tried it yet. The problem I have here is that GAE only produces a very generic error message. What I hoping for here is that someone could provide an indication as to what possibly GAE might not like in order to throw this error.

My data model looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Users can create entities. Each entity has the following properties:\n#1). the auto generated key. #2). The creator. #3). A number.</li>\n<li>In the app, I'm doing the following queries:\na). Query entities by creator (#2). b). Query entities by the number property (#3). c). Query the entity by id(#1).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm using the low level datastore API. Now, here are several problematic approaches I have tried:</p>\n\n<p>[Approach 1]: With the Datastore, if I make the entities parentless (no ancester), then things are good, especially the query 'c' can be easily achieved by Datastore.get(k). </p>\n\n<p>Problem of Approach1: Since the datastore is \"eventually consistent\", for query 'a' the result is ALWAYS not update to date. If a user creates an entity, then lists all entities he creates, the newly created one is always missing. It only appears by refresh in a few seconds later...Tried using memcache, does not help the case (or I'm not finding a good way?).</p>\n\n<p>To overcome the problem above, I changed the data structure. Here's [Approach 2]: when creating each entity, create a key based on the creator, and put the new entity as child of the key. So all entities created by a user are entities with an ancester. Thus query 'a' works in a timely manner, and query 'b' also seems to work. </p>\n\n<p>The new problem of Approach2: For query 'c', it always returns nothing. Here's my query 'c'. Both of them can not find the entity, always:</p>\n\n<p>method 1:<br>\n    Entity en = datastore.get(k)</p>\n\n<p>method2: </p>\n\n<pre><code>DatastoreService ds = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService();\nQuery q = new Query(kind)\n    .setFilter(FilterOperator.EQUAL.of(Entity.KEY_RESERVED_PROPERTY, k));\nEntity en = ds.prepare(q).asSingleEntity();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another try: Approach3:\nGroup all entities under one ancestor. This overcomes the problem in Approach1, and can be queried with an ancestor filter so it's ok to retrieve the result. </p>\n\n<p>Problem of Approach3: Such structure groups all entities as one entity group. Per Google datastore specification, write operation can happen 5 times at the most per second. This is a limit I'd not want to hit...</p>\n\n<p>I think this kind of data model is really common. Is there a proper way to structure the data? Any help is appreciated.

On development once you get the session cookies you can access the internal pages just fine.  I thought the problem was related to saving the cookies, but they look correct as the requests are nearly identical.  </p>\n\n<p>This is how I call it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fetchresp = urlfetch.fetch(url=req.get_full_url(),\n    payload=req.get_data(),\n    method=method,\n    headers=all_headers,\n    allow_truncated=False,\n    follow_redirects=False,\n    deadline=10\n    )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are some guesses as to the problem:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The distributed nature of google's url fetch implementation is messing things up.</li>\n<li>On production, headers are sent in a different order than in development, perhaps confusing the server.</li>\n<li>Some of google's servers are blacklisted by the target server.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are some hypothesis that I've ruled out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google caching is too aggressive. But I still get the problem after turning off cache by  using the header Cache-Control: no-store.</li>\n<li>Google's urlfetch is too fast for the target server. But I still get the problem after inserting delays between calls.</li>\n<li>Google appends some data to the User-Agent header. But I have added that header to development and I don't get the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What other differences are there between the production URL fetch and the development URL fetch? Do you have any ideas for debugging this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>(First update was incorporated above)\nI don't know if it was something I did (maybe adding delays or disabling caches mentioned above) but now the production environment works about 50% of the time. This definitely looks like a race condition. Unfortunately, I have no idea if the problem is in my code, google's code, or the target server's code.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","google-app-engine"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":448,"score":1,"question_id":5867803,"title":"Getting Permission Denied on using app engine","body":"<p>Using eclispe Helios with Google app plugin.<br>\nI am learning to use google app engine and was trying to make guestbook as provided in demo.<br>\nwhen ran it as Web Application i got the following error:</p>\n\n<pre>\nMay 3, 2011 3:16:59 PM com.google.appengine.tools.info.RemoteVersionFactory getVersion\nINFO: Unable to access https://appengine.google.com/api/updatecheck?runtime=java&release=1.4.0&timestamp=1291156877&api_versions=['1.0']\njava.net.SocketException: Permission denied: connect\n    at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method)**  \n</pre>\n\n<p>Please provide me with a solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","gae-datastore"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":1,"question_id":12704918,"title":"Faceted search impact on GAE datastore reads","body":"<p>Let's say I have 1000 entities.

I am trying to write unit tests for that code, but I am quite stumped with how to write a stub client to receive a response message from the servlet, instead of me always having to rely on using an actual web page as my test client. My servlet is quite simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ChannelService channelService = ChannelServiceFactory.getChannelService();\nchannelService.sendMessage(new ChannelMessage(someKey, \"ECHO: \" + someMsg));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Usually, I read this in my test client, which is a web page. But, I want to write unit tests that I can test using a framework like jUnit or TestNG. After reading Google's <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting\" rel=\"nofollow\">page about unit testing their Java services</a>, I tried stuff such as using a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting/javadoc/com/google/appengine/tools/development/testing/LocalServiceTestHelper\" rel=\"nofollow\">LocalServiceTestHelper</a> object in my test class and configure it with a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting/javadoc/com/google/appengine/tools/development/testing/LocalChannelServiceTestConfig\" rel=\"nofollow\">LocalChannelServiceTestConfig</a> object. The result of this is that my test class can create an instance of <code>LocalChannelService</code>, a class which seems to implement the same methods as <code>ChannelService</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neither classes have any robust relationship to each other (don't implement a similar interface, are not in the same class hierarchy...). Makes it impossible for me to inject a LocalChannelService object into my servlet as a mock object.</li>\n<li>No documentation whatsoever on LocalChannelService API (Thanks a lot, Google).</li>\n<li>Also no documentation on their Local Unit Testing page for how to test the Channel API (again, thanks a lot Google)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So then I came across this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11172174/how-can-i-unit-test-the-appengine-channel-service\">post</a> about how to test <code>ChannelService</code> in Java code. Unfortunately, the only relevant answer given was for <em>Python</em>. Well, lo and behold, Google indeed does provide Python GAE server developers with tools for writing stub clients for Google services, as outline in their <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/localunittesting?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python Local Unit Testing guide</a>. Unbelievable how they neglected to do the same for Java!</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Now that I've gotten all that off my chest (apologies if I sounded a bit too flustered), I would really like to know, what is the best way for testing Java code relying on Google App Engine's Channel API? I really wish to rely on testing tools instead of web pages. do I have to somehow call Google's <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/channel/javascript\" rel=\"nofollow\">Javascript Client for Channel API</a> from Java?

I'm important and require a real-time response!!!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> - \"answer me <em>when you can</em>; I need to know the answer at some point but it's really not all that ugent.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Command</strong> - \"I don't need an answer. This isn't really a request, it's just a command to do something or process something on the server-side.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My <em>game plan</em> is to implement my GWT code so that I can specify, for each specific server-side request (<strong>note: I've decided to go with <code>RequestFactory</code> over traditional GWT-RPC</strong> for reasons outside the scope of this question), which type of request it is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>SynchronousRequest</code> - Synchronous (from above); sends a command and eagerly awaits a response that it then uses to update the client's state somehow</li>\n<li><code>AsynchronousRequest</code> - Asynchronous (from above); makes an initial request and somehow - either through polling or the GAE Channel API, is notified when the response is finally received</li>\n<li><code>CommandRequest</code> - Command (from above); makes a server-side request and does not wait for a response (even if the server fails to, or refuses to, oblige the command)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I guess my intention with <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is not to produce a totally blocking request, however it may block the user's ability to interact with a specific <code>Widget</code> or portion of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>The added kicker here is this: GAE strongly enforces a timeout on all of its frontend instances (60 seconds). Backend instances have much more relaxed constraints for timeouts, threading, etc. So it is obvious to me that <code>AsynchronousRequests</code> and <code>CommandRequests</code> should be routed to backend instances so that GAE timeouts do not become an issue with them.</p>\n\n<p>However, if GAE is behaving badly, or if we're hitting peak traffic, or if my code just plain sucks, I have to account for the scenario where a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is made (which would have to go through a timeout-regulated frontend instance) and will timeout unless my GAE server code does something fancy. I know there is a method in the GAE API that I can call to see how many milliseconds a request has before its about to timeout; but although the name of it escapes me right now, it's what this \"fancy\" code would be based off of. Let's call it <code>public static long GAE.timeLeftOnRequestInMillis()</code> for the sake of this question.</p>\n\n<p>In this scenario, I'd like to detect that a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> is about to timeout, and somehow dynamically convert it into an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> so that it doesn't time out. Perhaps this means sending an <code>AboutToTimeoutResponse</code> back to the client, and force the client to decide about whether to resend as an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> or just fail. Or perhaps we can just transform the <code>SynchronousRequest</code> into an <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> and push it to a queue where a backend instance will consume it, process it and return a response. I don't have any preferences when it comes to implementation, so long as the request doesn't fail or timeout because the server couldn't handle it fast enough (because of GAE-imposed regulations).</p>\n\n<p>So then, here is what I'm actually asking here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can I wrap a <code>RequestFactory</code> call inside <code>SynchronousRequest</code>, <code>AsynchronousRequest</code> and <code>CommandRequest</code> in such a way that the <code>RequestFactory</code> call behaves the way each of them is intended? In other words, so that the call either partially-blocks (synchronous), can be notified/updated at some point down the road (asynchronous), or can just fire-and-forget (command)?</li>\n<li>How can I implement my requirement to let a <code>SynchronousRequest</code> bypass GAE's 60-second timeout and still get processed without failing?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please note: timeout issues are easily circumvented by re-routing things to backend instances, but backends don't/can't scale. I need scalability here as well (that's primarily why I'm on GAE in the first place!) - so I need a solution that deals with scalable frontend instances and their timeouts.

After changing the rule to not match them anymore, the files could be accessed by the application.</p>\n\n<p>I'm creating a Google AppEngine application. I'm using the Go language but I'm not sure that's relevant. I want to use a template with a separate template file. So the application must read the template file. Locally this works but after uploading the app to GAE, I get \"no such file or directory\" when calling template.ParseFiles().</p>\n\n<p>So I'm thinking that somehow I must indicate that the template files are application files so that they get uploaded in the right way. I thought maybe my template files were uploaded as static files because of this in my app.yaml</p>\n\n<pre><code>- url: /(.*\\.html)\n  static_files: \\1\n  upload: .*\\.html\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I moved them to their own directory.

I tried adding an upload directive for my script rule in app.yaml like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- url: /.*\n  script: _go_app\n  upload: templates/.*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that didn't seem to be allowed.

And on my Google App Engine server, I inspected the GET request made to the PROTECTED_URL_GET_USER_EMAIL, and it contained a proper authentication HTTP Header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>'Authorization': 'OAuth oauth_consumer_key=\"shiprack-test1.appspot.com\", oauth_nonce=\"...\", oauth_signature=\"...\", oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA1\", oauth_timestamp=\"...\", oauth_token=\"...\"'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the oauth python package on GAE (google.appengine.api.oauth), my server is able to authenticate the user and determine the user's email address (oauth.get_current_user()).</p>\n\n<p>However, the problem is when I convert the PROTECTED_URL_GET_USER_EMAIL to an HTTP Post request.

I also added ATDD in the question title, because I am trying to test the output of my web api which is bigger than just a unit test.</p>\n\n<p>I am using:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google App Engine 1.7.1</li>\n<li>GAE High Replication Datastore </li>\n<li>Python 2.7.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I setup my tests using the boilerplate code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.testbed = testbed.Testbed()\nself.testbed.activate()\nself.policy = datastore_stub_util.PseudoRandomHRConsistencyPolicy(probability=0)\nself.testbed.init_datastore_v3_stub()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I call a mock object setup to setup my entities and persist them to the testbed datastore. I use a counter to add 5 artists with artist_id 1 - 5:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def add_mock_artist_with(self, artist_id, link_id, name):\n    new_artist = dto.Artist(key_name=str(artist_id),\n        name=name,\n        link_id= str(link_id))\n    new_artist.put()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My test is that my web api returns:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"artists\": [\n            {\n            \"artist\": {\n                \"name\": \"Artist 1\",\n                \"links\": {\n                    \"self\": {\n                        \"href\": \"https://my_server.com/artist/1/\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n.\n.\n.      \n            {\n            \"artist\": {\n                \"name\": \"Artist 5\",\n                \"links\": {\n                    \"self\": {\n                        \"href\": \"https://my_server.com/artist/5/\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://my_server.com/artists/\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Initially I thought that if I were to startup a new test bed every time I run the tests, I could count on my artists being entered sequentially into the data store and therefore would get ids 1 - 5. My tests passed initially, but over time started to fail because of ids not matching (I would get a link like:  \"href\": \"https://my_server.com/artist/78/\"). I felt a little guilty relying on ids being generated sequentially, so I resolved to fix it. I stumbled upon the concept of a key being either a name or a generated id. I updated my templates for the returned JSON to use:   </p>\n\n<pre><code>artist.key().id_or_name()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the case of a mock object, I supplied the key name on construction with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>key_name=str(artist_id) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For non-mock construction, I did not include that line of code and let GAE assign the id. </p>\n\n<p>Since my template used key().id_or_name() to output the property, all went well and the tests passed. </p>\n\n<p>However, now when I test the return of an individual artist which would be available by following <a href=\"http://my_server.com/artist/5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://my_server.com/artist/5/</a>, my test fails. To grab the artist out of the datastore, I use the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def retrieve_artist_by(id):\n    artist = dto.Artist.get_by_id()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In production, this will work fine because it will all be id based. However, in my test, it is not finding anything because I have used the key_name=str(artist_id) in my mock construction, and the name is not the same as the id.</p>\n\n<p>I was hoping for something similar to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>artist = dto.Artist.get_by_id_or_name()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","google-app-engine","datetime"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":82,"score":0,"question_id":12545689,"title":"getting datetime from python string when tzinfo is present","body":"<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5010945/gae-howto-get-date-from-form-request\">I have found answers to question like this one helpful but not complete for my problem.</a>\nI have a form where the user automatically produces a date.

Now I have another problem, the method is just returning None.  I don't know if that means that the <code>super</code> implementation of <code>all()</code> returns None (Maybe it doesn't know what entity is calling it?) or just there is some other bug with my code.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","google-app-engine","gwt","memcached"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":81,"score":1,"question_id":11387503,"title":"Multithreading when serving cached data from app engine","body":"<p>I have a very simple question and could not find an answer, which makes me think that I am most likely missing some basic facts.</p>\n\n<p>I am using memcache to cache and serve large static data, which should generally enable us serving thousands of users from a single instance; however, it seems like that since app engine is single threaded, every request is queued and served in sequence and then ultimately starts multiple instances when serving a lot of users…</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the latency and especially when starting new instances, this causes even a much bigger pricing problem.

When I run the dataload, all 4 instances receive traffic and my enforced rate stays at 30/s rather than throttling to 15s and my through put goes up (QPS around 7.5 per instance and latency of 310ms)  I really want the dataloads to run as fast as possible so I am willing to have a large number of instances turned on to process as many records in parallel as possible and I would like the instances shut off when they complete.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone seen similar issues - can anyone at Google comment?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","algorithm","google-app-engine"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":86,"score":0,"question_id":12468702,"title":"Basic friend timeline algorithm?","body":"<p>I'm sure a lot of services online today must perform a task similar to what I'm doing.

I thought this was perhaps some effect of the Chrome plugin running under devmode, so I actually compiled the app and ran it as a compiled GAE app (dev_appserver.sh); exact same problem.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another odd effect is that under some circumstances (perhaps after having just done the above) I go to the main page of my app and the RPC service I wrote to get the logout URL for the user replies that the user is not logged in.</p>\n\n<p>Given the app.yaml configuration (which seems to correctly generate the web.xml) to not even let the user see the page unless they are logged in, how is it possible for that to even happen?  Even if the user is being correctly logged out (by the page when then says 404), how can I ever go to my app main page and yet not be logged in?</p>\n\n<p>Is this an Ajax effect where the user is logged out, but the page says around (having already been rendered when the user was logged in) and then the RPC hits the server and finds out that the user is now logged out?  If this is the case, then it seems rather pointless to restrict access in the app.yaml / web.xml as I also have to check it every time I get an RPC call anyway, right?  (I suppose the app.yaml configuration might save a few server round-trips the first time the user visits the page?)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I'm running an up-to-date version of OS X 10.6.8 (x86).\nMy browser is Chrome: 16.0.912.63 (Official Build 113337)</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ java -version\njava version \"1.6.0_29\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11-402-10M3527)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.4-b02-402, mixed mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm using gwt-2.4.0.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","web-services","google-app-engine"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":408,"score":0,"question_id":9614542,"title":"Web Service - org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException:","body":"<p>I'm trying to call my Web Service which i created in Google Apple Engine from my Android.

My code :</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $(\"#ff\").selectmenu({ select: function () {\n        var img = $(\"&lt;img /&gt;\").attr(\"src\", \"/images/load.gif\");\n        $(\".preview\").append(img);\n        $('body').append(\"&lt;link rel='stylesheet' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=\" + escape($(this).val()) + \"' type='text/css' media='all' /&gt;\");\n        $(\".preview\").css({ fontFamily: $(this).val() });\n        $(img).remove();\n    }\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the loading image is not showing because may be the link tag is requesting the font asynchronously. How can i show the loading image until the font is fully loaded ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","google-chrome-extension"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":1,"question_id":12403550,"title":"Embedding client ID in Chrome Extension for Server on Google App Engine","body":"<p>I am trying to find out as to what is the most appropriate way through which I can embed a client ID with my Google Chrome Extension?

It was straightforward to set up, except I was receiving a very poorly described <em>Error #1000</em> when trying with a specific domain. That is, if I tried <em>test.example.com</em>, it worked, but with <em>blog.example.com</em>, it failed.</p>\n\n<p>I try and set up both subdomains as CNAME records to Google's servers.

Everything fine here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I said, for some reason, I can't map specifically <em>blog.example.com</em>. But the weirdest thing is that, when requested, Google returns a 301 Redirect to <em>www.blog.example.com</em> (which, incidentally, cannot be mapped to the App too).</p>\n\n<p>Nowhere in any of the installed apps of this domain appears this subdomain, nor is set up as a redirect in any way. I've disabled suspicious applications like Sites and Blogger and went for hours around the dashboard trying to find something.

The only conclusion I reach is that somewhere in some Google server an outdated record is forcing a redirect on that subdomain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have any experience in situations like this and, is there any way of listing every single subdomain mapping for a given Google Apps domain?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","asp.net","google-app-engine","urlfetch"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":1,"question_id":12316329,"title":"got Validation of viewstate MAC failed when sending post request from google app engine via url fetch service","body":"<p>I have a task to fetch html from a website, before I go to that page I need to log in.</p>\n\n<p>I use a low-level api url fetch service.

I'm familiar with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting\">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/localunittesting</a> -- these tools are great for small unit tests.  I'm now interested in developing integration tests that test actual web requests.  For example, I'd like to test that web.xml is mapping servlets and filters to the expected URLs and test that my JSPs generate what I expect.</p>\n\n<p>My aim was to bring up a local development server inside the JVM, which I could fire requests against.  I'm open to other integration strategies, though; as I say above, I just want to effectively test JSP generation and other request-level features.</p>\n\n<p>I've managed to use DevAppServerFactory to start a development server in the same JVM.  However, it appears that the DevAppServer this generates uses a separate classloader from the main JVM.  This makes testing a lot more challenging--I can't use any of the local unittesting Local*TestConfig classes to control behavior of this server.  Similarly, I can't \"roll my own\" hooks for modifying behavior via e.g. statics, since the statics I can mutate in the test harness aren't the same statics the DevAppServer is looking at.  This makes it challenging to skip features not central to the current test (e.g. requiring login), to inject failures, to inject mocks, etc.  This really limits how completely and efficiently I can test my code.</p>\n\n<p>I've found a real dearth of documentation on the web for integration testing with App Engine.  I'm sure someone has done this before...are there any tips or resources out there you can share?</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","xmpp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":537,"score":0,"question_id":2274436,"title":"Check if a user is typing using App Engine XMPP","body":"<p>The XMPP service in GAE is great and all, but I'm really interested in when a user opens up a window to send a message, or when he/she starts typing.

There is also a Utils.py file that has some classless functions for checking user authorization, etc.  I put these in a separate .py simply because I was otherwise getting errors when trying to define the custom jinja2 filter for the other functions in that .py file.</p>\n\n<p>At the top of every .py file there are a number of import statements and then before the first class statement there are the following few lines of code to enable jinja2 and the custom filter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TEMPLATE_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'templates')\njinja_environment = \\\n    jinja2.Environment(loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader(TEMPLATE_DIR))\njinja_environment.filters['AccessOK'] = AccessOK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The base handler is always the same with the following statements (I think these are only for jinja2 and sessions):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BaseHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):\n\n    @webapp2.cached_property\n    def jinja2(self):\n        return jinja2.get_jinja2(app=self.app)\n\n    def render_template(self, filename, template_values, **template_args ):\n        template = jinja_environment.get_template(filename)\n        self.response.out.write(template.render(template_values))\n\n    def dispatch(self):\n        # Get a session store for this request.\n        self.session_store = sessions.get_store(request=self.request)\n        try:\n            # Dispatch the request.\n            webapp2.RequestHandler.dispatch(self)\n        finally:\n            # Save all sessions.\n            self.session_store.save_sessions(self.response)\n\n    @webapp2.cached_property\n    def session(self):\n        # Returns a session using the default cookie key.\n        return self.session_store.get_session()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>QUESTIONS:\n1. If I want code to be executed on every user request, would I put this in main.py (after the current config statement) or would it be best put somewhere else?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do I have to do anything in app.yaml for such functionality?</p></li>\n<li><p>Do the BaseHandler statements execute every time any function is executed that is in a class that references the BaseHandler?  Are there any exceptions?</p></li>\n<li><p>Do I really need the functionality to start the sessions in the BaseHandler of each and every .py file?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does code at the top of the main.py (before the \"app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([\" line) execute for every request going through main.py?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does code placed before the BaseHandler class in the regular.py files execute every time anything in the .py file executes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does it make sense to have a separate .py file for each data kind as I am doing?  Is there a different best practice for determining what .py files to have?</p></li>\n<li><p>I have seen references to <code>__init__</code>.  Does this mean the code in that function executes only once per app-engine startup for that .py file the first time anything in that .py file executes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Right now I have a lot of cases where I populate lists that are used in select input fields.  In some cases I am using the same list in a lot of different places.  Currently I am populating these lists just before I render the templates for each template the list is used in.  Where could I populate the lists once and have them available for each template (I don't know which template might be called first)?</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding the session management, I assume the functionality logic would look something like:</p>\n\n<p>if sessionID:\n    update SessionSuppl record\nelse:\n    create SessionSuppl record</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do I have to hand code this or is there already some kind of functionality in a module in GAE/Python or is there a better way of handling this entire functionality?</p>\n\n<p>I guess one could boil my problem down to lack of understanding of scope of code in various files or areas within files and also knowing when code in different parts of the application execute (whether execute once and when or whether execute repeatedly and when).</p>\n\n<p>I guess by now I have confirmed how much of a newbie I am.  I am very thankful for any answers anyone might be able to give me to these questions or be able to point me to documentation or tutorials that might be helpful.  Please do not point me to the standard webapp2 or app-engine documentation.  Hello world examples do not get into the depth I am referring to and I do not find abstract explanations and code snippets without a COMPREHENSIVE code example are also not helping.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware that this is just a part of the base of my application.  I am also managing my own roles and permissions (I manage permissions down to the point where individual fields in a form or display may or may not be editable or even visible depending on the roles assigned to the current user).  Suggestions for any standard modules that might handle this to this level of detail would also be appreciated.  (I have avoided Django because I do not want to go sql route and I hear about issues with the ndb version - plus it may be overkill for what I am trying to do.)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for any help.  If it ends up that there is not a good single source of documentation of these issues for someone like me, I will write up my experience to try to help others have a shorter learning curve than I am having.</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","google-cloud-storage"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":0,"question_id":12129174,"title":"how can I set google cloud storage ACL to give READ permission only to GAE apps?","body":"<p>The bucket is project-private.

most likely a more general Python query.  </p>\n\n<p>I was attempting to inherit and extend one of the db.Property classes in GAE by adding a method that will return an integer representation of a special String value for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class DbHHMM(db.StringProperty):\n\n   def to_mins(self):\n      '''Convert the string to minutes''' \n      arr = re.split(\":\",self)\n      ret = 0.0\n      if (len(arr)==2):\n         ret = (int(arr[0])*60)+(int(arr[1]))\n      return ret;   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my model I have a method that sums up a series of these values eg:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class WorkSchedule(db.Model):\n    '''todo - core hours for the days\n    TODO is there any way to attach a widgeted form to these via newform =  WorkScheduleForm() '''\n\n    time1 = DbHHMM() \n    time2 = DbHHMM()\n    total = db.IntegerProperty\n\n    def sum_times:\n      self.total = time1.to_mins + time2.to_mins\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However when sum_times is called I seem to get the error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'to_mins'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it possible to add extra methods to the GAE Property classes what are the Python techniques that have been used to prevent this? Am I doing something totally wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","internationalization","webapp2","babel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":103,"score":0,"question_id":12097897,"title":"Error

The process take a lot of data to process, and  all-at-once generation takes more time and memory that I can give. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried a few different methods to hack my way though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">xhtml2pdf</a> with HTML generation and conversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rportlab</a> to generate some pages and</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyPdf</a> for merging</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With varying result I got it working, but it is slow and takes more memory than it should (sometimes hitting instance soft memory limit). Currently I generate some sections in different tasks storing each in blobstore and merge those with pyPdf, but it chokes on larger documents.</p>\n\n<p>The document I'm generating is not that complicated, mostly tables and text, no internal references, no TOC, no anything that should be aware of the rest of the document. I can live with platypus for layouting and I do not need no fancy document look or HTML2PDF conversion.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to generate the document as fast as datastore will allow it.

But I cant seem to find on how to, pause generation, store partial PDF to stream, and them resume generation with that stream to generate next page in a different task.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How on GAE generate a larger than a few pages PDF document, splitting the generation between task requests, then store the resulting document in the blobstore?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If generation splitting is not possible with reportlab, then how to minimize the footprint of merging different PDF documents so it would fit the limits set by GAE task request?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nAlternatives to Conversion API much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2nd UPDATE</strong>\nConversion API is being decommissioned, so that's not an option now.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["google-app-engine","python-2.7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":97,"score":0,"question_id":12038214,"title":"Get url of Image in GAE (Python 2.7)","body":"<p>I am trying to get URL of Image(blob field of GAE):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Product(db.Model):\n  name = db.StringProperty()\n  price = db.FloatProperty()\n  added = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)\n  image = db.BlobProperty(default=None)\n\n\nurl = images.get_serving_url(movie.image)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Handler of serve image:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def result(request):\n  product = Product()\n  product.name = \"halva\"\n  url = 'http://echealthinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/minnesota.jpg'\n  product.image = db.Blob(urlfetch.Fetch(url).content)\n  product.put()\n\n  template = loader.get_template(\"result.html\")\n  context = RequestContext(request, \n                         {\n        \"result\" : u\"Add\"})\n\n  return HttpResponse(template.render(context))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But i get except: </p>\n\n<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When try to ignore this exception(that was bug in Python 2.7) I get exception in other place.</p>\n\n<p>And after that i try to encode Image to 'latin-1'('utf-8' don't work):</p>\n\n<pre><code> enc_img = movie.image.decode(\"latin-1\")\n url = images.get_serving_url(enc_img)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result: url has a view like binary file:</p>\n\n<pre><code> \"ÝêÓ9&gt;èýÑNëCf Äàr0xã³3Ï^µ7±\\íQÀ¡&gt;.....ÕÝ£°Ëÿ\"I¢¶L`ù¥ºûMþÒ¸ÿ+ÿL¢ï£ÿÙ' alt=\"\" /&gt;\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How I get url to show dynamic image in template?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine","http","ssl","https"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":101,"score":0,"question_id":12048798,"title":"Change http to https","body":"<p>I am learning to use the Google Apps Engine.
