Their code base is not attached with the rails app that other developers are working on, but kept separate. We have automated several test cases so far, and now what problem we have is, some (watir/cucumber specs)test cases require some data to be preexist into db, so it(testcase) should focus only on the problem stmt, and not creating any data-require itself.</p>\n\n<p>Example, say if it has to check whether rating is working for a post, it requires a post object should preexist and it just checks rating. And not creating 1st post object and then checking its rating.</p>\n\n<p>What are the best approaches here? Like we have fixtures and factory-girl for rails unit testing, what is there for cucumber specs? Or Shall we make use of features only here? These testers may not have idea of all models that exist, do they be aware of them so to make use of fixtures by calling Rails-Model interface.</p>\n\n<p>My idea was, when we write feature file, it should not point or talk about any Model which looks meta stuff. Watir/specs test cases should only be aware of \"Web-application\"/browser only as the interface to talk/deal with the application. They should not know any other interface(fixture/Models). Hence they should create their own data on their own, by making use of the single interface they know.</p>\n\n<p>Again, what I want to know that, is there any ruby lib/code, given table names, column names, and values(all most like fixtures yml), along with db parameters. It will simply insert them into db, without context of rails environment. And so testers those are having their environment isolated from rails web developers would able to work on their own. Rails fixtures, or factory girls seem to be well coupled with rails. Or am I incorrect?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","printing","syntax-highlighting"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":720,"score":1,"question_id":2112222,"title":"How can I print syntax-highlighted Ruby code?","body":"<p>I use TextMate for my Ruby editing, but when printing files, the code isn't syntax highlighted.

Our stack consists of Rails and Authlogic.

First : </p>\n\n<pre><code>  require 'trollop'\n  opts = Trollop::options do\n  banner &lt;&lt;-EOS\nWelcome to points generator!\n\nUsage:\n       test [options] &lt;filenames&gt;+\nwhere [options] are:\nEOS\n    opt :x_min,             \"Minimal value of X\", :type =&gt; :int  \n    opt :x_max,             \"Maximal value of X\", :type =&gt; :int \n    opt :y_min,             \"Minimalna wartosc Y\", :type =&gt; :int \n    opt :y_max,             \"Maksymalna wartosc Y\", :type =&gt; :int \n    opt :interval,          \"Interval between points\", :type =&gt; :int, :default =&gt; 1 \n    opt :products_file,     \"Name of products_file\", :type =&gt; :string, :default =&gt;  \n                            \"Products\"     \n  end\n\n  p opts # a hash: { :monkey=&gt;false, :name=&gt;nil, :num_limbs=&gt;4, :help=&gt;false }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First file is straight from Trollop git-hub site with small chages due to my program specification. Second file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>products = []\n(x_min/interval..x_max/interval).each do |x|\n  (y_min/interval..y_max/interval).each do|y|\n  products &lt;&lt; [x*interval,y*interval]\n  end\nend\n\na = products.map.with_index{|w, i| \"#{i+1} #{w[0].to_s} #{w[1].to_s} \\n\"}\n\naFile = File.new( products_file, \"w+\")\nif aFile\n    a.each{|x| aFile.write(x)}\n    else\n    puts \"Something wrong!\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The question is: How to put this thing together?

The problem is when the initialization with the block is more complex. Then it is done in <code>before</code> and reused by a number of different tests in the context, among them the one testing if the block was evaluated. See the example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-rb prettyprint-override\"><code>context \"the node definition using block of code\" do\n  before do\n     @n=node do\n        # this block should be called\n     end\n     # some more complex setup concerning @n\n  end\n\n  it \"should call the block\" do\n     # how to test it?\n  end\n\n  # here a bunch of other tests using @n\n\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the solution with side effect changing value of a local variable does not work. Raising an exception from the block is useless since the whole statement must be properly evaluated to be used by the other tests.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I could do the tests separately, but it seems to stink, since I must copy-paste the initialization part and since the was-the-block-called test inherently belongs to this very context.</p>\n\n<p>How to test if the block was evaluated in such a case?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Explanation for question asked by @zetetic below.</p>\n\n<p>The context is that I'm implementing a kind of DSL, with <em>nodes</em> defined by their parameters and blocks of code (that can define something else in the scope of node). Since the things defined by the node's block can be pretty generic, at least for the first attempt I just need to be sure the block is evaluated and that what a user provides there will be considered. For now does not matter what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Probably I should refactor my tests now and using mocks make them test behaviors rather then implementation. However it will be a little bit tricky, for the sake of some mixins and dynamic handling of messages sent to objects. For now the cincept of such tests is a little bit fuzzy in my head ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway your answers and comments helped me to better understand how RSpec works and explained why what I'm trying to do looks as if it did not fit to the RSpec.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","mongodb","nested-forms","nested-form-for"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":5,"question_id":13182651,"title":"Nested fields with mongodb","body":"<p>I'm trying to create nested fields using mongodb.

At the moment, it uses a hybrid of constraint propagation and search, at each step checking a box, and calling the solution method recursively for each valid option.  Most puzzles solve within seconds, even milliseconds, but I specifically had in mind to challenge the solver with the worst-case sort of puzzle for brute force, one I had found on Wikipedia.  Growing impatient at 45 mins of solve time, I timed the number of seconds per step each puzzle took and extrapolated that this puzzle would take 10 hours.\nTo make the time more reasonable I have some further optimizations in mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I used some hashes for sloppy purposes and I'll clean my code up</li>\n<li>I'd like to try parrallelization even though my laptop only has 2 cores</li>\n<li>I'll use some actual logical strategies for the puzzle, such as naked pairs, X-wing, etc</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I'd like to generalize the solver's abilities to irregular sudokus, so I figured I'd move from a plain old 2D array to using nodes which link up with other nodes of their region.  This got me to thinking about the nature of the data structure I'll be designing as a whole.  I have a few options, and I'm in a data structures class right now, so bear with me if I don't fully wrap my head around the vagaries thereof, but mainly they are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a 2d grid of nodes linked to each other by region, and columns and rows are still handled by the same array iteration code</li>\n<li>one 2d linked list characterized by a single head pointer, and each row and column is lumped together with the region data</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The gist of the node class is that it has the following data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>value</li>\n<li>is mutable (i.e., is not a known initial value)</li>\n<li>unfilled neighbors</li>\n<li>filled neighbors (to memoize the available values somewhat instead of searching everywhere each time)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and the following methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>get remaining values</li>\n<li>fill box</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data structure option 1 allows for the duplication of the entire grid and passing a new copy of it amongst functions instead of altering state.  In the case of state alterations, I need to account for backtracking, which would mean an additional #empty_box method.</p>\n\n<p>Data structure option 2 necessitates a longer handshaking period setting up the node linkages to account for adding links to each element of a row, column or region to each of its neighbors once and once only.  However, cloning the puzzle is O(n^2) at <em>each step</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like the actual solution code would be simpler if all the boxes which need to be checked were in one list, though.  Strategies for sudoku are generally agnostic to their physical layout as much as their logical layout.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any sort of difference in performance to expect between the two options?  Am I on the right track, or perhaps overcomplicating the design?  I intuit the nodes are a good idea on all counts regarding the various optimizations and feature extensions I wish to implement, but I have doubts.  Critiques are welcome as well as answers to the specific question of which may be assumed to be faster.  Memory usage isn't really a concern.</p>\n\n<p>The code is rather involved for question answering purposes, but may be <a href=\"http://github.com/alexnye/sudoku_solver\" rel=\"nofollow\">perused at leisure</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":2,"question_id":13280086,"title":"Open another terminal to display information","body":"<p>I was wondering if there were a simple way to open a second terminal to display data.

It must be a pretty damn good implementation of the language, then!</li>\n<li><strong>Does EventMachine work with Ruinius?</strong> As far as I know, EventMachine partially relies on Fibers (correct me if I'm wrong) which weren't implemented until 1.9. I know Rubinius will eventually support 1.9, too; I don't mind waiting a little.</li>\n<li><strong>Do C extensions work in Rubinius?</strong> I have written a C extension which \"serializes\" binary messages received from a TCP stream into Ruby Objects and vice-versa (I suppose the details are not important, but if it helps answer this question I will update the post). This can be a <em>lot</em> of messages! I managed to write the same code in Ruby (although, it made little sense after a month), but it proved to be a real bottle-neck in the application. So, I had to use C as a \"solution\" to my problem.\n<strong>EDIT</strong>: I just remembered, I use C for another task, it is a hit-test method for Arrays. Basically it just checks if a \"point\" is inside an a polygon, it was impossibly slow in CRuby.</li>\n<li><strong>If the previous answer was a \"No,\" is there then an alternative for C extensions in Rubinus?</strong> I gather the VM is written in C++, so that then.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A few \"bonus\" questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Will C-Ruby (2.0+, YARV) ever get rid of GIL?

It is currently structured so that the code only needs to be described once, and is displayed in both its raw and interpreted versions, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;% code = &lt;&lt;PLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n&lt;div&gt;\n  #{ image_tag 'image.png' }\n&lt;/div&gt;  \nPLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n%&gt;\n\n&lt;%= raw code %&gt;\n&lt;%= content_tag :pre, code, class: \"prettyprint linenums\" %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is great, and fairly easy to maintain. The problem comes in with the rails helpers, like <code>image_tag</code> in the above example. The view example correctly displays an image in a div, and the code example displays the relevant HTML. In this case, the relevant HTML includes an anchor tag - the results of the <code>image_tag</code> method, not the call itself.</p>\n\n<p>I would prefer the code examples to display the helper methods, rather that their results. I am able to make this work by specifying the example code in a file, and either rendering or reading the file. I would prefer to make this work by specifying the code in a variable, as above, but I can't seem to get an ERB delimiter to work inside of a string inside of an erb block. Even the simplest case of <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> doesn't work at all. I've tried playing with the syntax (<code>&lt;%% %%&gt;</code> and <code>% %</code> for example), using details from the <a href=\"http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, without much success.</p>\n\n<p>The only information I could find on the matter is <a href=\"http://markmail.org/message/gpz5bpqvbclogo7a\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, using <code>&lt;%= \"&lt;\" + \"%=\" %&gt; link_to &lt;%= image.css_tag.humanize %&gt; &lt;%= \"%\" + \"&gt;\" %&gt; %&gt;</code>, which does not work in this use case (if at all).</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a way to specify a string that contains a ERB end-delimiter (<code>%&gt;</code>) in an ERB string, or am I stuck using the slightly clunkier file-read method? Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I would like to end up with is a working version of this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%# Idealized code - does not work %&gt;\n&lt;% code = &lt;&lt;PLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;% image_tag 'image.png' %&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;  \nPLACE_THE_EXAMPLE_CODE_BETWEEN_THESE_TWO_LINES_EXACTLY_AS_YOU_WANT_IT_TO_APPEAR\n%&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that <code>&lt;%= raw code %&gt;</code> would (continue to) output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"/images/image.png\" alt=\"Image\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And <code>&lt;%= content_tag :pre, code, class: \"prettyprint linenums\" %&gt;</code> would output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;% image_tag 'image.png' %&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;  \n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of what it currently does when using a variable, which is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/image.png\" alt=\"Image\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want users to be able to copy the code example and paste it into a new view, without having to translate HTML back into the helpers that produce them. I think what I basically need is an alternative ERB delimiter, in the same way that <code>'</code> and <code>\"</code> (or even <code>%q{}</code>) vary for strings. It seems that even though the final ERB delimiter is occurring inside of a string, it is being actually processed as the end of the block. The simplest case of <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> demonstrates somewhat what I want to accomplish. In a generator, you might use <code>&lt;% foo = '&lt;%%= bar %&gt;' %&gt;</code> (or something similar), to tell it not to process as ERB right then and there. This all works fine when reading from a file, or even in a pure rb file (like a helper), but it makes the most sense to put it in the view, in this case, as it is intended to be easily manipulated by our designers.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13264208,"title":"group by in active records","body":"<p>I have one instance variable with two records. </p>\n\n<pre><code>           id   item_with_detail_id  quantity\n\n           100       205                3\n\n\n           101       205                5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, i want the result as follows using Active record group_by .</p>\n\n<pre><code>           100       205                8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i tried with </p>\n\n<pre><code>@bill_details=@bill_details.group_by{|bd| bd.item_with_detail_id}.values.map(&amp;:first)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but its not working.

Many of these blocks contain system commands, and I'm trying to debug a very specific case of executing a piece of AppleScript within a bash script that I'm calling. The script in question is for controlling Spotify by the command line, and <a href=\"http://harishnarayanan.org/projects/shpotify/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this is the code</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm getting is that an abort trap error is occurring every time the script is run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>spotify: line 57: 94108 Abort trap    osascript -e 'tell application \"Spotify\" to pause'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This must be related to the environment of the Ruby script where the call is made, but I'm having trouble seeing why. Here's the block of code calling it:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Ruby code\nreaction :hello do |event|\n  system \"spotify pause\"\n  system \"say 'Hello world'\"\n  system \"spotify play\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This block is run periodically via a <code>yield</code> statement, when a particular event is triggered through a socket connection. The script is also daemonized, using the ruby gem \"daemons\", to allow it to run in the background (but still as the current user, according to <code>ps</code> and the ruby environment variable). Not only this, but each socket connection starts a new thread, so the code is run in a separate thread from the main one.</p>\n\n<p>In my debugging I've tried running the line <code>system \"spotify pause\"</code> after the daemon starts up the script, without a problem. It also runs fine in the following script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread.new do\n  system(\"spotify pause\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it isn't starting a new thread or daemonizing in itself that causes the problem, but it seems to be a combination of these things and maybe the fact that the block is being yielded  that means that an abort trap is being raised by the AppleScript in the bash script.</p>\n\n<p>If you can drag yourself up the many, many layers of complication back into reality, I would appreciate any suggestions you have for solving or even debugging this weird case!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","erb","friendly-id"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13229354,"title":"Rails and Friendly ID gem path helper issue","body":"<p>I've posted this as an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/333\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github page for Friendly ID</a>, but haven't yet had any response.

I am currently using ISO 8601 timestamps with a UTC time zone to represent times. However, I don't like the idea of these timestamps being attached to any timezone because the times should be the same no matter what timezone you are in. 5PM UTC should be 5PM CST, etc... </p>\n\n<p>I know that you can leave the Z off of an ISO timestamp, and it will be interpreted as whatever local time you are in. Is this ok practice? And if so, how do I do this in Ruby? I read the doc for the Time class and didn't see anything about this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Let me re-word this just a little bit, or atleast clarify something. The reason why I'm seeking timestamps that aren't attached to a timezone is exactly because I know that my client servers and API server will hardly ever match up. If a client is submitting an event with a time, that time needs to be ambiguously equal to the ambiguous locale specific to the event that the user is working on. </p>\n\n<p>That's a mouthful...assume that I'm working on an event scheduler. Each event belongs to a storefront or location of a company. When times are being shown for a location, it is assumed that the times shown are in the timezone of the location, and for clarity's sake should never be shown at a time formatted to a user's local timezone. If I'm looking at the scheduler on the East Coast, but looking at events for locations on the West Coast, the times I should see should be local to the locations on the West Coast, not adjusted for my timezone. </p>\n\n<p>I know a solution could be to simply store times with timezone information for the location its associated to. But the use case that a user would want to convert a time to their timezone is VERY rare, and I'd rather make implementing my API easier...this was actually my original implementation but implementing the API in many different environments and across multiple programming languages, it became clear that it is a hurdle to show times local to that timestamp's timezone for a lot of languages. If a user wanted to convert times to their local timezone I could easily store global timezone information for the location object itself. </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","command-line-arguments","optparse"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13224386,"title":"Option With 2 Arguments in OptParse","body":"<p>I'm trying to do something that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>opt_parser = OptionParser.new do |opt|\n    opt.banner = \"Test\"\n    opt.separator \"\"\n    opt.on(\"-t\", \"--test arg1 arg2\", \"Test\") do |arg1, arg2|\n        puts arg1\n        puts arg2\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that it returns the <code>arg1</code>, but <code>arg2</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

Warning: the following is not a question, rather explanation of what I came up with. My question is — do you have a better way to do this? Is there some common technique for this that I'm not familiar with? Seems like this is a trivial problem.</p>\n\n<p>So you have Task model. You can create tasks, complete them, destroy them. Then you have recurring tasks. It's just like regular task, but it has a recurrence rule attached to it. However, tasks can recur indefinitely — you can go a year ahead in the schedule, and you should see the task show up.</p>\n\n<p>So when a user creates a recurring task, you don't want to build thousands of tasks for hundred years into the future, and save them to database, right? So I started thinking — how do you create them?</p>\n\n<p>One way would be to create them as you view your schedule. So, when the user is moving a month ahead, any recurring tasks will be created. Of course that means that you can't simply work with database records of tasks any longer. Every SELECT operation on tasks you ever do has to be in the context of a particular date range, in order to trigger recurring tasks in that date range to persist. This is a maintenance and performance burden, but doable.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, but how about the original task? Every recurrent task gets associated with the recurrence rule that created it, and every recurrence rule needs to know the original task that started the recurrence. The latter is important, because you need to clone the original task into new dates as the user browses their schedule. I guess doable too.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens if the original task is updated? It means that now as we browse the schedule, we will be creating recurring tasks cloned off of the modified task. That's undesirable. All the implicitly persisted recurring tasks should show up the way the original task looked like when recurrence was added. So we need to store a copy of the original task separately, and clone from that, in order for recurrence to work.</p>\n\n<p>However, when the user navigates the tasks in the schedule, how do we know if at a particular point a new recurrence task needs to be created? We ask recurrence rule: \"hey, should I persist a task for this day?\" and it says yes or no. If there is already a task for this recurrence for this day, we don't create one. All nice, except a user shall also be able to simply delete one of the recurring tasks that has been automatically persisted. In that case following our logic, the system will re-create the task that has been deleted. Not good. So it means we need to keep storing the task, but mark it as deleted task for this recurrence. Meh.</p>\n\n<p>As I said in the beginning, I want to know if somebody else tackled this problem and can provide architectural advice here. Does it have to be this messy? Is there anything more elegant I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since this question is hard to answer perfectly, I will approve the most helpful insight into design/architecture, which has the best helpfulness/trade-offs ratio for this type of problem. It does not have to encompass all the details.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","heroku"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":0,"question_id":8263987,"title":"Different Webpage on Heroku and Local Host","body":"<p>So I have my local machine and it is configured to tell me which branch I'm working with on the terminal.

The solution to this mostly is to:</p>\n\n<p>a. Use another two modules for class X and Y and insert them to the classes with the \"include\" directive, then let S include the module the new modules instead of inheriting X and Y.</p>\n\n<p>b. Just transform X and Y to a module instead and insert them to class S.</p>\n\n<p>The drawback here is that if class X and Y is already stable or at least needs to be unmodified, like</p>\n\n<p>a. In two projects with different function where both needs to be the same like for the sake of tracking the version well.</p>\n\n<p>b. Class X and Y is part of a library.</p>\n\n<p>you are forced to:</p>\n\n<p>a. Just modify the classes anyway.</p>\n\n<p>b. Create a new version of the library.</p>\n\n<p>c. Just literally add the functions inside the subclass and create a similar implementation based on the classes. You'll have to examine or study the whole classes for that.</p>\n\n<p>If classes could have been easily inherited (in a multiple manner) just like modules modifications and adjustments would have been unneeded and consistency among projects and modules (packages) or libraries would have been maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Creating abstract classes to be reused over many times is not easy since you'll never know what newer subclasses would need hence you'll have to revise them from time to time. Difficulty arises if classes are used by multiple projects. It's never easy to decide when to just write a class, just write a module, or always write a class the have contents written in a pair module e.g. A &lt;-> AMod, or A &lt;-> A::SelfMod.</p>\n\n<p>I made this post just to know just in case if there are better solutions (not just obvious and common workarounds) to this and not to complain. Perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the title and first descriptions but that actually depends on the tone you choose when you read it.</p>\n\n<p>I also made this post to see if my observation is correct, and so far it seems that I could verify that it's really just how it is.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","mongodb","encoding","utf-8","gmail"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13203586,"title":"Encoding::UndefinedConversionError from email body","body":"<p>using <code>mail</code> for ruby I am getting this message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mail.rb:22:in `encode': \"\\xC7\" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8 (Encoding::UndefinedConversionError)\n    from mail.rb:22:in `&lt;main&gt;'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I remove encode I get a message ruby</p>\n\n<pre><code>/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/bson-1.7.0/lib/bson/bson_ruby.rb:63:in `rescue in to_utf8_binary': String not valid utf-8: \"&lt;div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"gmail_quote\\\"&gt;l&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"gmail_quote\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"gmail_quote\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"&gt;&lt;div dir=\\\"rtl\\\"&gt;\\xC7\\xE1\\xE4\\xD5 \\xC8\\xC7\\xE1\\xE1\\xDB\\xC9 \\xC7\\xE1\\xDA\\xD1\\xC8\\xED\\xC9&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" (BSON::InvalidStringEncoding)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'mail'\nrequire 'mongo'\n\nconnection = Mongo::Connection.new\ndb = connection.db(\"DB\")\ndb = Mongo::Connection.new.db(\"DB\")\nnewsCollection = db[\"news\"]\n\nMail.defaults do\n  retriever_method :pop3, :address    =&gt; \"pop.gmail.com\",\n                          :port       =&gt; 995,\n                          :user_name  =&gt; 'my_username',\n                          :password   =&gt; '*****',\n                          :enable_ssl =&gt; true\nend\nemails = Mail.last\n#Checks if email is multipart and decods accordingly.

While creating a Sinatra site by requiring <code>'sinatra'</code> and setting up the routes directly under is pretty easy and rather well documented, creating an application by requiring <code>'sinatra/base'</code> and writing a class that inherits from <code>'Sinatra::Base</code>', while still relatively easy, is very poorly documented (maybe because it's a pretty recent feature of Sinatra).</p>\n\n<p>And that's exactly what I am doing. I am not having too much trouble on the Sinatra part, however I am having a bit of trouble on the rackup/thin/server part. Apparently there are two ways to deploy the application: using Sinatra itself (using the <code>run!</code> method) and using a rackup file (typically <code>config.ru</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Using Sinatra's <code>run!</code> method is extremely intuitive and works like a charm, but apparently it doesn't work if I want to deploy my app on heroku. As a matter of fact, almost all the Sinatra apps that I have encountered on GitHub use a <code>config.ru</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>Using a rackup file might be equally intuitive, but I can't manage to understand how to pass options from the Sinatra app to the server (ir: the port). I tried to merge options to rackup's default options array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyApp::App.default_options.merge!(\n  :run  =&gt; false,\n  :env  =&gt; :production,\n  :port =&gt; 4567\n)\n\nrun MyApp::App\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>by adding options directly to the app:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyApp::App.set :port, 4567\nMyApp::App.set :run, false\nMyApp::App.set :env, :production\n\nrun MyApp::App\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>by setting options from within the application class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>module MyApp\n  class App &lt; Sinatra::Base\n    set :port, 4567\n    set :run, false\n    set :env, :production\n\n    # ...\n\n  # config.ru\n  require 'app'\n\n  run MyApp::App\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All the methods above failed, either by showing error messages or by just not taking any of the options into consideration. So is there any way to pass options to rackup/thin/the sever via a Sinatra app when using a rackup file?

I have been able to import the Items to an excel spreadsheet. but it imports every thing on the webpage. and i would like to be able to have seperate sprreadsheets for each type of item and have the spread sheet update automaticly. so i went to the google data api. an the problem there is that facebook wont let my google spreadsheet script access anything it redirects me to the login page(or atleast that is what i suspect because when i run the debug it shows the a redirected url). then i read about how javascript does not work coss domain.<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9284768/cross-domain-javascript\">cross domain javascript</a>. and sience google spript is java based i thought that that might be the problem. so I went to scraperwiki<a href=\"https://scraperwiki.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://scraperwiki.com/</a> and created a spript there in php thinking that would solve the problem. Now i should mention that i have tested if i can access this page without being loged into facebook (meaning i logged out of facebook and called the site and i was able to pull the site up in the browser and use a java shell to get the data i wanted. then when i click another link that requirs me to belogged into facebook the login screen would show up i would click the bookmark to the page i want to get the data from and i can see it and get the data from javashell.) </p>\n\n<p>So after that long story my questions are\n1. will oauth solve this road block?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>if i created a FB app would i be able to get the data i wanted and then be able to get it to the google spreadsheet?</p></li>\n<li><p>would something like Watin <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/watin\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/watin</a> be a better way?

Let's say Person (everyone says, \"Person\").  There are many different attributes of Persons that I might know, but in my application I am not guaranteed to know any of them.  Person attributes include Name, Height, Weight, ShoeSize, etc.  I may have dozens of attributes that I want to store.  The straightforward solution is to create a Person model that has all attributes defined with all of them being possible null valued.  With the list of attributes being so variable, and so numerous, I am wondering whether there might be a better way.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed solution:\n  A serialized hash class.  The class is implemented with</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A sequence to keep track of most recent recordID</li>\n<li>a table of acceptable attributes (to ensure some standardization of attributes)</li>\n<li>a table containing recordID, attributeID, value.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The primary key is recordID+attributeID, and there is an index on attributeID.

I haven't given that a lot of thought yet.

So, this is a classical many-to-many relationship.</p>\n\n<p>I came up with the following migrations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    class CreateExercises &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def self.up\n        create_table :exercises do |t|\n          t.integer :user_id\n          t.string :name\n          t.text :beschreibung\n          t.integer :resulttype_id\n          t.boolean :active, :default =&gt; true\n          t.timestamps\n        end\n      end\n      def self.down\n        drop_table :exercises\n      end\n    end\n\n    class CreateResulttypes &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def self.up\n        create_table :resulttypes do |t|\n          t.string :name\n          t.string :einheit\n          t.text :beschreibung\n\n          t.timestamps\n        end\n      end\n\n      def self.down\n        drop_table :resulttypes\n      end\n    end\n\n    class CreateExercisesResulttypesJoin &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def self.up\n        create_table :exercises_resulttypes, :id =&gt; false do |t|\n          t.integer \"exercise_id\"\n          t.integer \"resulttype_id\"\n        end\n        add_index :exercises_resulttypes, [\"exercise_id\", \"resulttype_id\"]\n      end\n\n      def self.down\n        drop_table :exercises_resulttypes\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which works nicely with this formtastic code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;%= semantic_form_for(@exercise) do |f| %&gt;        \n      &lt;%= f.inputs do %&gt;\n        &lt;%= f.input :name %&gt;\n        &lt;%= f.input :beschreibung %&gt;\n        &lt;%= f.input :resulttype %&gt;\n        &lt;%= f.input :active %&gt;\n      &lt;% end %&gt;\n      &lt;%= f.buttons %&gt;\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is here, that with this code I can not sort the resulttypes and each exercise can have each resulttype once only.\nSo I changed the formtastic :resulttype form code to this (except the jquery code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;div id=\"conn_ctrl\" class=\"float_left center\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"float_left center\"&gt;\n                &lt;%= f.select :resulttypes, @resall.collect{|d| [d.name,d.id]}.sort, {}, { :multiple =&gt; true, :class =&gt; \"conn_select\" } %&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"float_left center\"&gt;\n                &lt;%= f.select :resulttypes, '', {}, { :multiple =&gt; true, :id =&gt; \"exercise_resulttypes_save\", :class =&gt; \"conn_select\" } %&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div style=\"clear: both\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;%= tag(\"input\", { :type =&gt; \"button\", :id =&gt; \"remove\", :class =&gt; \"dualbuttons\", :name =&gt; \"\", :value =&gt; \"&lt;&lt;\" }, false) %&gt;\n            &lt;%= tag(\"input\", { :type =&gt; \"button\", :id =&gt; \"add\", :class =&gt; \"dualbuttons\", :name =&gt; \"\", :value =&gt; \"&gt;&gt;\" }, false) %&gt;\n            &lt;%= tag(\"input\", { :type =&gt; \"button\", :id =&gt; \"up\", :class =&gt; \"dualbuttons\", :name =&gt; \"\", :value =&gt; \"Up\" }, false) %&gt;\n            &lt;%= tag(\"input\", { :type =&gt; \"button\", :id =&gt; \"down\", :class =&gt; \"dualbuttons\", :name =&gt; \"\", :value =&gt; \"Down\" }, false) %&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div style=\"clear: both\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I have a \"Dual Listbox\" and I can add exercises to this specific workout multiple times and order it how I like it.\nBUT, when I submit the form, I get this error and I have no idea what that means:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resulttype(#-614051528) expected, got String(#-608366078)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The submitted parameters are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    {\"commit\"=&gt;\"Create Exercise\",\n     \"authenticity_token\"=&gt;\"v1l9zfxdxIJbdjZx6SsZ5tGuKMrlioBg+C9orSmVarA=\",\n     \"utf8\"=&gt;\"✓\",\n     \"exercise\"=&gt;{\"name\"=&gt;\"dddd\",\n     \"beschreibung\"=&gt;\"ddddd\",\n     \"resulttypes\"=&gt;[\"5\",\n     \"3\",\n     \"1\"],\n     \"active\"=&gt;\"1\"}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This currently drives me crazy a little bit.

This uses the 'chef_gem' provider to install the 'mysql' rubygem.  As this is a native extension it needs to be compiled and, to do this, the development files for MySQL need to be installed.</p>\n\n<p>If I use the normal MySQL binaries everything works well as MySQL is already in the Centos repositories.  However, so that I can install the Percona packages, I need to ensure that the repo is in '/etc/yum.repos.d'.  The problem I am having is that I cannot get chef to do that work before attempting to install the mysql gem.</p>\n\n<p>So, what ends up happening is the system attempts to compile the mysql gem without the development header files for MySQL (Percona) being installed and, even if they are referenced correctly, they are not found as the repository has not been setup.</p>\n\n<p>I created a 'percona-repo' recipe that does this work using the 'yum' provider but it does not run before the 'chef_gem' does.  I know that chef has two phases for running and I am assuming that 'chef_gem' is gathering all gems up in the compile phase, regardless of where they are in the overall run list, and then installing all items requested at the beginning.  The repository recipe would then be run afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to play around with the Ruby recipe to do things like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>include_recipe \"mysql::percona_repo\"\n\nnode['mysql']['client']['packages'].each do |mysql_pack|\n    package mysql_pack do\n        action :nothing\n    end.run_action(:install)\nend\n\nchef_gem \"mysql\" do\n   action :nothing\nend.run_action(:install)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this does not work.  The chef_gem always runs before my \"precona_repo\" recipe, so the the package installs fail which, if it got that far, would mean that the ruby gem installation would also fail.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has any bright ideas on how I can solve this please let me know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the suggestion from Mark, I have now update the 'ruby' recipe so that I call the resources to add the new key and repo to the server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>resources(:yum_key =&gt; \"RPM-GPG-KEY-percona\").run_action(:add)\nresources(:yum_repository =&gt; \"Percona\").run_action(:add)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now I can see these being activated in the chef run.  However when I look at the filesystem the files are not there so the installation of the mysql client packages fails.</p>\n\n<p>I have done some digging around in the yum cookbook and have found that the provider for the yum_key attempts to run 'remote_file' to download the key as you would expect.  However this 'remote_file' is not running.  So then I tried to run this as a resource like the above but it has a variable in the name so I cannot call it effectively, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>remote_file \"/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/#{new_resource.key}\" do\n    ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think I am beginning to go down a bit of a rabbit warren here.  I will keep attempting to get the thing to work but any more ideas are most welcome.  I am trying not to go down the route of directly coding in the repo in this recipe as I prefer to reuse things that I know work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","ruby-on-rails-3.1"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13173594,"title":"Rails 3 Speed up Active Record Callbacks after_commit to send notifications using Private_pub","body":"<p>I am using 3 callbacks after a post is created.</p>\n\n<p>1) Post created</p>\n\n<p>callback#1) <code>after_commit :do_notify, :on =&gt; :create</code>  for crating Notification</p>\n\n<p>2) Notification created</p>\n\n<p>callback#2) <code>after_commit :publish_to_all, :on =&gt; :create</code> for sending out messages/ to user using Private_pub</p>\n\n<p>It is taking more than a minute to complete whole flow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question#1: <em>Is the approach wrong</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Question#2: <em>is there a method to send rest of callbacks to background\n  and complete it there.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","security","https","sinatra","rack"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13173543,"title":"Using https in Sinarta (Rack) application","body":"<p>I develop   a Sinatra app which lets users to login through some external web sites.

This is what the line currently looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%= select :profile, :sexual_interest, SEXUAL_INTEREST_ARRAY, {:prompt =&gt; 'sexuality'}, {:class =&gt; 'selectFull'} %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried changing some of the options using :default => 'sexuality' and then tried :disabled => 'sexuality'. But I seem to only be able to remove the option entirely from the select element or have it as the first value in the drop down list and being displayed as the default value.</p>\n\n<p>If you are just having issues setting the default value of your select field using a ruby form helper, reference this post <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/623458/rails-select-helper-default-selected-value-how\">selecting a default for option field</a></p>\n\n<p>If any one could give me some insight as to how to fix this issue I would greatly appreciate it. Any ideas would help, Thanks for reading.</p>\n\n<p>-Alan</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","activerecord"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13167743,"title":"Safe querying by find, sql, or where","body":"<p>I want to find all widgets with their common or internal names in a certain list <code>query_list</code>.

But on the otherhand, using the scope operator brings its own set of problems...</p>\n\n<p>First, to use constants somewhere upstream in the current namespace context, you have to use the full namespace of that constant for Ruby to find it.

The slide show is controlled with a navigation element  which I would like to populate by the h1 tags in the partials.  I'm not going to manually enter these things every time a change is made!  I want the end user to simply drag and drop partials into a directory (with a certain name convention and h1 tag description for navigation) and let the slide show do everything else.</p>\n\n<p>I could impose a class on the h1 tag \"forNavigation\" and on the content \"sliderContent\" and then use jquery to create a post load <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> but that doesn't seem right.  Plus they'll all be part of the same rendered div.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I'm not clear why reading the first 50 characters of a partial, copying whats in the h1 tags, and putting it in a  isn't the most elegant solution?</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, above does everything needed except copy and print whats between the first h1 tag... With an xml parser or some regexp it'll be done.  I'm just no good with parsing files.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know other methods to approach this.  Right now I still think it's best to parse the partial (with or without rendering) and put what I need where I want it as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","rspec"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":132,"score":6,"question_id":13008922,"title":"Testing Response cookie with Rspec v.1","body":"<p>When I login to my app the server sends me back cookies(credentials and some app's cookie):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Response sent 170 bytes of Cookie data:\n Set-Cookie: user_credentials=val; path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\n\nResponse sent 554 bytes of Cookie data:\n Set-Cookie: _app_session=otherVal; path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and then redirects to the home page;</p>\n\n<p>Cookies include some flags: e.g. <code>httpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>How can I test whether cookies do include those flags with Rspec?</p>\n\n<p>At least where can I find those cookies?</p>\n\n<pre><code>it \"should generate cookies with proper flags\" do    \n    params = Factory.attributes_for(:user,\n      :username =&gt; \"uname\",\n      :password =&gt; \"upass\"\n    )\n    # login\n    post 'create', params\n\n    response.should redirect_to home_url # =&gt; pass\n\n    puts \"response cookie = #{response.cookies.inspect}\" # =&gt; {} // no cookies in response, why?\nend\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","ruby","orm","relational-database","datamapper"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":13144198,"title":"DataMapper can't delete record because of relation","body":"<p>I have this many-many DataMapper/MySQL setup with Torrent and Tag, as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Torrent\n  include DataMapper::Resource\n\n  property :id,          Serial\n  property :name,        String\n  property :magnet,      Text\n  property :created_at,  DateTime\n\n  has n, :tags, :through =&gt; Resource\nend\n\nclass Tag\n  include DataMapper::Resource\n\n  property :id,      Serial\n  property :name,    String\n  property :hits,    Integer\n\n  has n, :torrents, :through =&gt; Resource\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When trying to destroy a torrent, however, via <code>Torrent.first.destroy</code> or something similar, DataMapper returns <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I tried straight SQL queries like <code>delete from torrents where name like '%ubuntu%'</code>, which failed because of MySQL error 1451:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`brightswipe`.`tag_torrents`, CONSTRAINT `tag_torrents_torrent_fk` FOREIGN KEY (`torrent_id`) REFERENCES `torrents` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I figure there's some DataMapper setup whereby when deleting a torrent I can:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the tag associations</li>\n<li>Delete the torrent</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And when deleting a tag I can:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the tag association from all torrents with that tag</li>\n<li>Delete the tag</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I go about this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","module","forem"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":13146303,"title":"Ruby - How to access module's methods?","body":"<p>I'm installing a forum using the Forem gem.

Sometimes <code>link_to</code> and <code>redirect_to</code> are explicit in the paths they're linking (e.g. <code>link_to 'New Person', new_person_path</code>), but many times the paths are implicit (e.g. <code>link_to 'Show', person</code>). </p>\n\n<p>I add some single table inheritance (STI) to my model (say <code>Employee &lt; Person</code>), and all of these methods break for an instance of the subclass (say <code>Employee</code>); when rails executes <code>link_to @person</code>, it errors with <code>undefined method employee_path' for #&lt;#&lt;Class:0x000001022bcd40&gt;:0x0000010226d038&gt;</code>. Rails is looking for a route defined by the class name of the object, which is employee. These employee routes are not defined, and there is no employee controller so the actions aren't defined either.</p>\n\n<p>This question has been asked before:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>At <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1773367/link-to-issue-with-inherited-active-record-class\">StackOverflow</a>, the answer is to edit every instance of link_to etc in your entire codebase, and state the path explicitly</li>\n<li>On <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/702728/get-route-for-base-class-of-sti-class-in-rails\">StackOverflow</a> again, two people suggest using <code>routes.rb</code> to map the subclass resources to the parent class (<code>map.resources :employees, :controller =&gt; 'people'</code>). The top answer in that same SO question suggests type-casting every instance object in the codebase using <code>.becomes</code></li>\n<li>Yet another one at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432858/broken-rails-routes-after-implementing-single-table-inheritance\">StackOverflow</a>, the top answer is way in the Do Repeat Yourself camp, and suggests creating duplicate scaffolding for every subclass.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/943300/single-table-inheritance-routing\">Here's</a> the same question again at SO, where the top answer seems to just be wrong (Rails magic Just Works!)</li>\n<li>Elsewhere on the web, I found <a href=\"http://strugglingwithruby.blogspot.com/2008/10/single-table-inheritance.html\">this blog post</a> where F2Andy recommends editing in the path everywhere in the code.</li>\n<li>On the blog post <a href=\"http://blog.lrdesign.com/2009/03/single-table-inheritance-and-restful-routes/\">Single Table Inheritance and RESTful Routes</a> at Logical Reality Design, it is recommended to map the resources for the subclass to the superclass controller, as in SO answer number 2 above.</li>\n<li>Alex Reisner has a post <a href=\"http://code.alexreisner.com/articles/single-table-inheritance-in-rails.html\">Single Table Inheritance in Rails</a>, in which he advocates against mapping the resources of the child classes to the parent class in <code>routes.rb</code>, since that only catches routing breakages from <code>link_to</code> and <code>redirect_to</code>, but not from <code>form_for</code>. So he recommends instead adding a method to the parent class to get the subclasses to lie about their class. Sounds good, but his method gave me the error <code>undefined local variable or method `child' for #</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So the answer that seems most elegant and has the most consensus (but it's not all <em>that</em> elegant, nor <em>that</em> much consensus), is the add the resources to your <code>routes.rb</code>. Except this doesn't work for <code>form_for</code>. I need some clarity! To distill the choices above, my options are</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>map the resources of the subclass to the controller of the superclass in <code>routes.rb</code> (and hope I don't need to call form_for on any subclasses)</li>\n<li>Override rails internal methods to make the classes lie to each other</li>\n<li>Edit every instance in the code where the path to an object's action is invoked implicitly or explicitly, either changing the path or type-casting the object.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With all these conflicting answers, I need a ruling. It seems to me like there is no good answer. Is this a failing in rails' design? If so, is it a bug that may get fixed? Or if not, then I'm hoping someone can set me straight on this, walk me through the pros and cons of each option (or explain why that's not an option), and which one is the right answer, and why. Or is there a right answer that I'm not finding on the web?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","hash"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":63,"score":2,"question_id":13130887,"title":"Could you please explain ruby hashes?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8189416/why-use-symbols-as-hash-keys-in-ruby\">Why use symbols as hash keys in Ruby?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Just wondering what's the difference?</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby[:key]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>vs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby[\"key\"]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","mechanize","http-authentication","mechanize-ruby"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":2,"question_id":13127678,"title":"Ruby Mechanize issues with http authentication","body":"<p>I'm having issues getting around websites that use http authentication, I have a list of sites which I do some scrapping on but some of these have http authentication on them.

Looks like it wasn't necessary or applied to an older version of Rails.  The inconsistencies in instructions when looking up help online is disorienting!  Removing the file leaves me with the previous problem though.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the entry in the Apache log that I believe correlates with the first error.

Adding and deleting tags to posts are working great. </p>\n\n<p>In my /view/posts/index.html.erb I have a section called tags where I am successfully querying the Tags table, grouping them and displaying the count next to the tag_name (as a side note, I mistakenly called the column containing the tag name, 'tag_name' instead of just 'name' as I should have) . In addition the display of these groups are a link that is referencing the index method in the PostsController. That is where the problem is. </p>\n\n<p>When you navigate to /posts you get an error because there is no parameter being passed (without clicking the tag group link). I have the .empty? in there so not sure what is going wrong here. Here is the error and code:</p>\n\n<p>Error</p>\n\n<pre><code>You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!\nYou might have expected an instance of Array.\nThe error occurred while evaluating nil.empty?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>/views/posts/index.html.erb</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;% @tag_counts.each do |tag_name, tag_count| %&gt; \n            &lt;tr&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to(tag_name, posts_path(:tag_name =&gt; tag_name)) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;(&lt;%=tag_count%&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PostsController</p>\n\n<pre><code>  def index\n    @tag_counts = Tag.count(:group =&gt; :tag_name, :order =&gt; 'updated_at DESC', :limit =&gt; 10)\n    @posts=Post.all(:joins =&gt; :tags,:conditions=&gt;(params[:tag_name].empty? ? {}: \n                     { :tags =&gt; { :tag_name =&gt; params[:tag_name] }}\n                     )\n                  )\n\n    respond_to do |format|\n      format.html # index.html.erb\n      format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @posts }\n      format.json { render :json =&gt; @posts }\n      format.atom\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","ruby","rubygems","rhomobile","rhodes"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":0,"question_id":10936472,"title":"Using third party apis in rhomobile","body":"<p>Rho mobile provides some API's for scanning barcode but its not providing for generating a barcode,so can we use any java API's for generating barcode in rhomobile for android..</p>\n\n<p>thanks,\nanudeep</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","facebook-graph-api","koala"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13103916,"title":"How to build a script that auto-post on my Facebook Pages with a non-permanent Access Token?","body":"<p>I'm developing a ruby script that push every new content on my Facebook Page as a post.\nI know about that the access token will expire in two hours, so how I could do that?</p>\n\n<p>Now this piece of code works because I set \"user_access_token\" manually (But after 2 hours it expire).

Currently there are \"courses\" and \"classrooms\" in the system. A \"course\" is thus some course, and a \"classroom\" is a specific instance of a course. F.ex. there might be 1 course, but 3 classroom instances of that course, having different start/end dates, slightly different/updated materials, etc. Now, an \"employee\" can be invited to participate in a \"course\", but the \"employees\" themselves, has to choose a specific \"classroom\" to enroll in. So, the employee goes to his/hers profile page, where the invitations show up. Now the employee clicks an invitation, and can then choose a specific classroom to enroll in. This should obviously create an enrollment. But, it should also get rid of the invitation, since it has been \"accepted\". Currently i have it set so that \"employees\" has many \"classrooms\" through \"enrollments\". Also, an \"employee\" has many \"courses\" through \"invitations\". This doesn't seem right though, since when an employee clicks some invitation, they will be taken to an enrollment page(enrollment controller), where an enrollment will be created. As the enrollment is created, the invitation should be deleted though. So right now i guess the enrollment controller should be able to create enrollments and delete invitations. This seems like bad design. I am pretty happy with the relation between classrooms and employees, but the relation between employees and invitations seems bad.

No 'stream' on my error. The end of the filename changes randomly each time I try to upload (Paperclip doing some collision avoidance I assume).</p>\n\n<p>The image field is set up in the model like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has_attached_file :image, :path =&gt; \":rails_root/public/images/:hash_:style.:extension\", :url =&gt; \"/images/:hash_:style.:extension\", :hash_secret =&gt; \"sometext\", :default_url =&gt; \"\", :styles =&gt; { :thumb =&gt; \"100x100#\" }\nvalidates_attachment_content_type :image, :content_type =&gt; ['image/jpeg','image/jpg','image/pjpeg','image/png','image/x-png','image/gif']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>has_attached_file</code> is using <code>:hash</code> at the moment, but I also tried with <code>:basefilename</code> or whatever it was and that didn't affect the results.

Didn't notice any changes from including them. If I open a command prompt, I can access the ImageMagick commands, so the path should be correct.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried to run this with the <code>:styles</code> removed, which allowed me to upload the original image file.

The next jump can always have a speed of the previous speed <code>s</code>, or <code>s - 1</code>, or <code>s + 1</code>.  So the first time, the speed is 1, and the next jump, the frog can jump 0, 1, or 2 steps.  If the frog chooses to jump 2 steps, then next time, it can jump 1, 2, or 3 steps.  The question is: write a function that returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> that tells whether it is possible for the frog to jump across the river successfully.</p>\n\n<p>I asked to clarify the question: if the first element in the array is false, does that mean the frog cannot succeed at all?  The interviewer said yes.</p>\n\n<p>So the following is the answer I came up with using recursion, together with some test output, but the interviewer insisted when looping through all possible next speeds, I cannot just return <code>true</code> (or the \"steps\" as an array indicating <code>true</code>), but that I have to consider all cases and do an \"OR\" on all cases -- but I think if it is true, that this jump plus the subsequent jumps can make it across the river, then it is already a final <code>true</code>.  If one speed doesn't work, I will try the next speed, so 1 possible solution is all we need.  Note that in Ruby, anything is true except for <code>nil</code> and <code>false</code>, so I am returning the array of jumps to print out the solution and also use it to denote true.

I need to hold this array in a configuration file so this is the reason it does not go directly into the connection string above.\nTo me it seems I have mapped hosts_mapped back to an array, but if I puts hosts_mapped I get the string in the correct format.</p>\n\n<p><code>\"192.168.0.2:27017\",\"192.168.0.3:27017\"</code></p>\n\n<p>A working connection string looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@conn = Mongo::ReplSetConnection.new([\"192.168.0.2:27017\",\"192.168.0.3:27017\"], :refresh_mode =&gt; :sync, :refresh_interval =&gt; 10)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any idea where I am going wrong here?</p>\n\n<p>Full code to test:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby -d \nrequire \"mongo\" \nhosts = [\"192.168.0.2:27017\",\"192.168.0.3:27017\"] \nhosts_mapped = hosts.map {|i| \"'\" + i.to_s + \"'\" }.join(\",\") @conn =\nMongo::ReplSetConnection.new([hosts_mapped], :refresh_mode =&gt; :sync,:refresh_interval =&gt; 10)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","c++","python","ruby","formatting"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":3,"question_id":13084726,"title":"Code split/format for press - need authoritative mention","body":"<p>I'm looking for fast and efficent way to split code and prapare it for press. I'm working for coder magazine, and it's always a huge problem to prepare code for press, 'cause  space in one column is limited. Now I'm doing it manually and it is very tiresome. Let me give you an example. This is a code I'm working on right now (already formatted/spitted in my own style), it's for Android:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void GetFiles() {\n  listBox1.Items.Clear();\n  var storeFile = IsolatedStorageFile. \n    GetUserStoreForApplication();\n  string fileString = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(\"*\");\n  string[] files = storeFile.GetFileNames(\"*\");\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; storeFile.GetFileNames(\"/\" + \n      fileString).Length; i++) {\n    String fileName = storeFile.GetFileNames(fileString)[i];\n    String ext = fileName.Substring(fileName.Length - 3);\n    if (ext == \"png\") listBox1.Items.Add(fileName);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}\n}</p>\n\n<p>Note that</p>\n\n<pre><code>var storeFile = IsolatedStorageFile. \n    GetUserStoreForApplication();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is one line. It's just too long for press column, that's why I split by the nearest logical break (here - point) and indent the second part of the line with 4 spaces (inline is always indented by 2 spaces). I know, it's not the best way, it's hard to understand. That's why I'm looking an authoritative answer from the wide range of software developers. I have to work not only with C++ code, but with Assembler, JavaScript, Ruby and Python. The last one is a separate problem - it's indent-dependive, so I have to be especially carefull with indents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, the question is:</strong> which is the best way to format code in limited space of the magazine? Which way do <strong>you</strong> prefer? Please, suggest your own ideas. Every answer is highly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPD</strong>: Here's the way how it looks in magazine now: <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/J0QtW.jpg\" alt=\"Current look\">. It may help you to uderstand the problem. Too long lines are splited by '\\' and the last part of line is indented. Not too obvious, isn't it? =(</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","heroku"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":86,"score":1,"question_id":13084626,"title":"HI, guys.

When I read a file, I might get a hash like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>h = {\"foo\" =&gt; :foo, \"Bar\" =&gt; :bar, \"BAZ\" =&gt; :baz}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I want to normalize the keys to lower case to get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>h = {\"foo\" =&gt; :foo, \"bar\" =&gt; :bar, \"baz\" =&gt; :baz}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>by doing something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>h.keys.each{|s| s.downcase!}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but that returns and error for the reason explained above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","deployment","asset-pipeline","ruby-on-rails-3.2"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":10,"up_vote_count":16,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1283,"score":16,"question_id":9294807,"title":"How can I make Rails 3 assets precompile faster?","body":"<p>I have a running Rails 3.2.1 application, that I'm deploying via Capistrano with the <code>deploy/assets</code> which runs the <code>deploy:assets:precompile</code> task.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works just fine, except that the compilation itself is really slow.

In case someone else is struggling with this as well, here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    class Recipe &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  attr_accessible :description, :name, :ingredients_attributes\n\n  has_many :unique_recipes\n  has_many :ingredients, :through =&gt; :unique_recipes\n\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :ingredients\n\nend\n\nclass UniqueRecipe &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  attr_accessible :quantity, :recipe_id, :ingredient_id\n\n    belongs_to :recipe\n    belongs_to :ingredient\n\nend\n\n\nclass Ingredient &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  attr_accessible :name, :unit, :unique_recipes_attributes\n\n  has_many :unique_recipes\n  has_many :recipes, :through =&gt; :unique_recipes\n\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :unique_recipes, allow_destroy: true\n\nend\n\n\n&lt;%= form_for @recipe, :html =&gt; { :class =&gt; 'form-horizontal' } do |f| %&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.label :name, :class =&gt; %&gt;\n      &lt;%= f.text_field :name, :class =&gt; 'text_field' %&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.label :description, :class =&gt; 'control-label' %&gt;\n      &lt;%= f.text_area :description, :class =&gt; 'text_area' %&gt;\n\n&lt;%= f.fields_for :ingredients do |ff| %&gt;\n    &lt;%= ff.label :name, :class =&gt; %&gt;\n      &lt;%= ff.text_field :name, :class =&gt; 'text_field' %&gt;\n    &lt;%= ff.label :unit, :class =&gt; %&gt;\n      &lt;%= ff.text_field :unit, :class =&gt; 'text_field' %&gt;\n  &lt;%= ff.fields_for :unique_recipes do |fff| %&gt;\n    &lt;%= fff.label :quantity, :class =&gt; %&gt;\n      &lt;%= fff.text_field :quantity, :class =&gt; 'text_field' %&gt;\n&lt;% end -%&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"form-actions\"&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.submit nil, :class =&gt; 'btn btn-primary' %&gt;\n    &lt;%= link_to t('.cancel', :default =&gt; t(\"helpers.links.cancel\")),\n                recipes_path, :class =&gt; 'btn' %&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","ssh","tty","net-ssh"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":1,"question_id":13076419,"title":"Ruby: Net::SSH::Multi using keys","body":"<p>I'm having problems getting Net::SSH::Multi library to work, it should connect to each box and run that command, I'm trying to get the output.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'net/ssh'\nrequire 'net/ssh/multi'\n\n@ssh_responses = Array.new\nputs \"Starting vhost grab...\"\n# SSH into each instance, and download Vhost Dump\nNet::SSH::Multi.start(:on_error =&gt; :ignore) do |ssh|\n\n  ssh.use 'ec2-1-1-1-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com', :user =&gt; 'portal_user', :keys =&gt; ['~/.ssh/portal_user.pem']\n  ssh.use 'ec2-1-1-1-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com', :user =&gt; 'portal_user', :keys =&gt; ['~/.ssh/portal_user.pem']\n  puts \"Added servers...\"\n  stdout = \"\"\n  # run this on all boxes\n  ssh.exec 'pwd' do |channel, stream, data|\n    puts \"Trying execution...\"\n    channel.request_pty do |c, success|\n      puts \"Trying to request tty...\"\n      if success\n        puts \"Successfully requested tty\"\n        command = \"sudo ls /root\"\n        c.exec(command) do |c, success, data|\n          puts \"Executing commands...\"\n          stdout &lt;&lt; data if stream == :stdout\n        end\n        @ssh_responses &lt;&lt; stdout\n        puts \"Storing responses...\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  ssh.loop\n\nend\n\nputs @ssh_responses\nputs \"Script executed.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the response I get from running is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ruby serverAction.rb \nStarting vhost grab...\nAdded servers...\nTrying execution...\nScript executed.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","ruby-on-rails-3.1"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13073690,"title":"Rails implicit render in templates from multiple controllers","body":"<p>I have code like <code>render @posts</code> to render my posts collection in an index template which the <code>PostsController</code> renders.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have an <code>Admin::PostsController</code> that also should render the collection but when my posts controller renders <code>@posts</code> it looks for the <code>admin/posts/_post.html.erb</code> partial.

In the javascript code, you just check if the <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> is on the page, and if it is, you run the javascript code that is associated with it. This way if the dynamic element is not on the page, the javascript code doesn't run - even though it's been included in the massive <code>application.js</code> file packaged by Sprockets.</p>\n\n<p>My above solution has the benefit that if a search box is included on 8 of the 100 pages, it will run on only those 8 pages. You also won't have to include the same code on 8 of the pages on the site.

So now if before calling any Ruby methods/functions I use \"load 'XXX.rb'\", it will reload the XXX.rb utilizing the new changes.</p>\n\n<p>PROBLEM:</p>\n\n<p>In my code I am using ScriptingContainer to run scriplets to access ruby functions. I set load paths on this scripting container to indicate from which locations the scripts should be loaded. However, the problem is that on subsequent calls and even with different instances of ScriptingContainer, I have noticed that the scripts that were loaded the first time are utilized every time. \"load\" reloads them, but after loading those scripts once, the next time I might need to load similar scripts from a different location but its not happening.</p>\n\n<p>My assumption was that utilizing a different scripting container instance should have done the job but it seems that the load paths are globally set somewhere and calling \"setLoadPath\" on new ScriptingContainer instances either does not modify existing paths or only appends. If the latter case is true then probably when searching for scripts they are always found on oldest paths set and newer load paths get ignored. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas???</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","passenger","mod-rails","phusion"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":7,"up_vote_count":15,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3657,"score":15,"question_id":623205,"title":"modrails - rogue ruby processes consuming 100% cpu","body":"<p>I'm having ruby instances from mod_rails go \"rogue\" --  these processes are no longer listed in passenger-status and utilize 100% cpu.  </p>\n\n<p>Other than installing god/monit to kill the instance, can anyone give me some advice on how to prevent this?

I have a site, where asynchron ajax calls are made to facebook (using JSONP). I'm recording all my HTTP requests on the ruby side with VCR, so I thought it would be cool, to use this feature for ajax calls as well.</p>\n\n<p>So I played a little bit around, and came up with a proxy attempt. I'm using PhantomJS as headless browser and poltergeist for the integration inside Capybara. Poltergeist is now configured to use a proxy like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Capybara.register_driver :poltergeist_vcr do |app|\n    options = {\n      :phantomjs_options =&gt; [\n        \"--proxy=127.0.0.1:9100\",\n        \"--proxy-type=http\",\n        \"--ignore-ssl-errors=yes\",\n        \"--web-security=no\"\n      ],\n      :inspector =&gt; true\n    }\n    Capybara::Poltergeist::Driver.new(app, options)\n  end\n  Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist_vcr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For testing purpose I wrote a proxy server based on WEbrick, that integrates VCR:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'io/wait'\nrequire 'webrick'\nrequire 'webrick/httpproxy'\n\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'vcr'\n\nmodule WEBrick\n  class VCRProxyServer &lt; HTTPProxyServer\n    def service(*args)\n      VCR.use_cassette('proxied') { super(*args) }\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nVCR.configure do |c|\n  c.stub_with :webmock\n  c.cassette_library_dir = '.'\n  c.default_cassette_options = { :record =&gt; :new_episodes }\n  c.ignore_localhost = true\nend\n\nIP   = '127.0.0.1'\nPORT = 9100\n\nreader, writer = IO.pipe\n\n@pid = fork do\n  reader.close\n  $stderr = writer\n  server = WEBrick::VCRProxyServer.new(:BindAddress =&gt; IP, :Port =&gt; PORT)\n  trap('INT') { server.shutdown }\n  server.start\nend\n\nraise 'VCR Proxy did not start in 10 seconds' unless reader.wait(10)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works well with every localhost calls, they get well recorded. The HTML, JS and CSS files are recorded by VCR. Then I enabled the <code>c.ignore_localhost = true</code> option, cause its useless (in my opinion) to record localhost calls.</p>\n\n<p>Then I tried again, but I had to figure out, that the AJAX calls that are made on the page aren't recorded. Even worse, they doesn't work anymore inside the tests.</p>\n\n<p>So to come to the point, my question is: Why are all calls to JS files on the localhost recorded, and JSONP calls to external ressources not? It can't be the jsonP thing, cause its a \"normal\" ajax request. Or is there a bug inside phantomjs, that ajax calls aren't proxied? If so, how could we fix that?</p>\n\n<p>If its running, I want to integrate the start and stop procedure insid</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","ruby-on-rails","ruby"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13039001,"title":"Dynamic Partial View","body":"<p>On my ROR site, I have a partial view that loads last played songs, according to last.fm.

Here are the first four lines from the log output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Status: 500 Internal Server Error\nundefined method `length' for #&lt;Pathname:/home/ofer/src/ssp3&gt;\n  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ruby-openid-2.1.7/lib/openid/extras.rb:3:in `starts_with?'\n  /home/ofer/src/ssp3/vendor/plugins/rack-bug/lib/rack/bug/panels/sql_panel/query.rb:65:in `filtered_backtrace'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, I still haven't fixed the first problem, and now I've discovered a second which will still be around even if I fix the first problem.  The second error seems to imply that Firefox on the dev server <em>was</em> actually loading the panel when the error hit, which apparently is in the ruby-openid internals.</p>\n\n<p>I feel even more set back than before.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","http","video-streaming"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":0,"question_id":13035054,"title":"HTTP video packet information and Rails 3 reconstruction","body":"<p>How is an HTTP video packet interpreted by a computer?

Now, what I want: when something changes on any division, I want to \"inform\" the building, or better, mark the building has being \"updated\" or \"modified\". </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Current solution: we have a self-written implementation in which we would mark division as \"affecting\" building, and building's \"modified\" timestamp would be updated each time a division would be updated. </p></li>\n<li><p>Desired solution: an already existing \"out-of-the-box\" implementation (a gem, a plugin, God, perhaps) which would spare us the work of refactoring our implementation. </p></li>\n<li><p>Unwanted solution: please, don't tell me to mark all these associations with :autosave => true.

Now, let's imagine 1 building affects 100 divisions, and each division affects 100 chairs. Now, the observer solution works only on the business level. That is, I have to instantiate every AR instance so that the observers can act. Which I hold as bad performance. If A affects 100 Bs, I do it with one DB statement. But how can the observers for these 100 be triggered when I do it all with SQL? </p>\n\n<p>So, back to the main update points: this behaviour is generic, and most importantly, the performance has to be top (associations may trigger nxn updates for has_many associations, for instance). </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby","uri","monkeypatching"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1239,"score":6,"question_id":3891158,"title":"How do I monkey-patch ruby's URI.parse method","body":"<p>Some popular blog sites typically use square brackets in their URLs but ruby's built-in URI.parse() method chokes on them, raising a nasty exception, as per:\n<a href=\"http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1466\">http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1466</a></p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to write a simple monkey-patch that gracefully handles URLs with the square bracket.
