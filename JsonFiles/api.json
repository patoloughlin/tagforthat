More below. The data is generated within different tasks/threads and thus a row based data format does not lend itself well to match this situation (because the data generated in different threads is generated at different times and is thus not aligned).

Its ok to run the writes on its own thread so this process can lag the data generation process but limitation is 16gb RAM (64bit code), more below.</p></li>\n<li><p>Preference is for columnar db format as it lends itself well to how I want to query the data later but I am open to any other structure if it makes sense in regards to the examples above (document/key-value also ok if all other requirements are met, especially in terms of write speed). </p></li>\n<li><p>API that can be referenced from within .Net. Example: HDF5 may be considered capable by some but I find their .Net port horrible.Something that supports .Net a little better would be a plus but if all other requirements are met then I can deal with something similar to the HDF5 .Net port.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Concurrent writes if possible: As described earlier I like to write data concurrently from different tasks/threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am constrained by 16gb memory (run .Net process in 64bit) and thus I probably look for something that is not purely in-memory as I may sometimes generate more data than that. Something in-memory which persists at times or a pure persistence model is probably preferable. </p></li>\n<li><p>Preference for embedded but if a server in a client/server solution can run as a windows service then no issue. </p></li>\n<li><p>In terms of data access I have strong preference for a db solution for which interfaces from R and Python already exist because I like to use the Panda library within Python for time series alignments and other analysis and run analyses within R.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the API/library supports in addition SQL/SQL-like/Linq/ like queries that would be terrific but generally I just need the absolute bare bones such as load columnar data in between start and end date (given the \"key\"/index is in such format) because I analyze and run queries within R/Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>If it comes with a management console or data visualizer that would be a plus but not a must. </p></li>\n<li><p>Should be open source or priced within \"reach\" (no, KDB does not qualify in that regards ;-)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OK, here is what I have so far, and again its all I got because most db solution simply fail already on the write performance requirement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Infobright and Db4o.

The relationship application - user is 1:m. The model is fully partitioned on application. Meaning application is self contained, there is no global pool for users. So in order to find an user I would need to know the application upfront.</p>\n\n<p>Designing the proper REST API for this case I don't find that easy. URIs usual shouldn't be dependent on the way the model is implemented. They should just address the resource. And URIs should be as short as possible, too. </p>\n\n<p>Now I'm thinking about what the URI for a user should look like. Basically I think it would be best to have just</p>\n\n<pre><code>/user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From an outside perspective this should be good. But I want to keep the partitioning of the data so I neither want having a global pool referencing all application users nor I want to search for a user in all the applications available. That means I need to add some context about the application. Making the URI look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>/application/{id}/user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>would solve the problem. While having my model in mind that makes sense. Application and user are composite, meaning the user has no meaning outside of an application. On the other hand I still think user could be a standalone resource. And my ids are UUIDs so the URL would become very long very quick and it is not that nice looking (if this counts as an argument :) )</p>\n\n<p>The third option would be to put an extra header in the HTTP request. It would be like</p>\n\n<pre><code>X-Foo-Application: {id}\nGET /user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how I do it at the moment. Having ids being UUIDs there is no chance (by design of an UUID) that any uri can be exist twice for different resources. But still I'm not sure if that is a proper way to make that compromise between standalone resources and partitioned data. </p>\n\n<p>Or maybe I'm just missing the obvious problem solving approach #4.

Clearly, the implementation isn't throwing any errors, but it works odd. Thus... I have a couple of unanswered questions:</p>\n\n<p>Q: May I be missing requests? It says in the Instagram API docs (http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/#receiving-updates) that I should acknowledge the request in less than 2 seconds. Here's how my code looks like in the callback method (PHP CodeIgniter):</p>\n\n<pre><code>if ($_SERVER ['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    header(\"Content-Length: 0\");\n    header(\"Connection: close\");\n    flush();\n\n    // do stuff with file_get_contents('php://input')\n    // also, get new photos...\n\n    $data   = json_decode (file_get_contents('php://input'));\n\n    if (is_array ($data))\n        foreach ($data as $geo) {\n            $this-&gt;db-&gt;query (\"LOGGING SOMETHING HERE...\");\n\n            // make some a cURL request to the geography endpoint\n            // get the photos, save them in the database\n            $this-&gt;live-&gt;updateGeo ($geo-&gt;object_id);\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Q: If I'm missing requests:\n- is it because the callback takes too long due to the added time of $this->live->updateGeo (which waits for the cURL call to end)?\n- is it because my server is in Romania and all the requests from Instagram come from USA IPs?</p>\n\n<p>I've analysed the raw access logs and from time to time I get a spike of requests, then a long span of silence. I'm thinking it's either because Instagram API is not posting anything to me or I'm not responding in less than 2 seconds. Otherwise... why are those requests taking place all at once (5-10 requests in a couple of seconds) - it's not like 5-10 people just happen to take photos all at the same time and then everybody just puts their phone back in the pocket :)</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post, I just need some opinions regarding my situation.\nAny smart idea or similar experience is highly appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nAdi</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","json","api","debugging","parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12,"score":0,"question_id":13208088,"title":"catching error json string from facebook api","body":"<p>i am trying to catch error messages, that are sent from the facebook api when trying to post to a wall.</p>\n\n<p>here is the json string that gets returned.\n{\"error\":{\"message\":\"(#506) Duplicate status message\",\"type\":\"OAuthException\",\"code\":506,\"error_data\":{\"kError\":1455006}}} </p>\n\n<p>how would i parse this string using the JavaScriptSerializer, as if i try to use the word \"error\" in a class as my property, it will not allow it as its a keyword in c#. code is below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim dbg As StreamReader = New StreamReader(e.Response.GetResponseStream)\nDim jss = New JavaScriptSerializer()\nDim fbdebug As fbDebuger = jss.Deserialize(Of fbDebuger)(dbg.ReadToEnd)\nResponse.Write(fbdebug.error)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Public Class fbDebuger\n        Public Property error As String</p>\n\n<pre><code>End Class\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["api","configuration","hadoop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13219052,"title":"Hadoop Mapreduce Configuration (New API)","body":"<p>I just wanted to try a tutorial (https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/DOC/Hadoop+Tutorial) program WordCount V.2 (bottom of the page) in which they are using the following method to set up some basic variables for the programm:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void configure(JobConf job) {\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However I'm trying to use the new Hadoop API and this method does not seem to exist anymore?

All students are users. In the database (django-ORM based), this is represented as a <code>Student</code> table with a foreign-key to the <code>User</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create a REST API, and an object hierarchy in the iOS app that models this API. I'm having trouble deciding how to model this.</p>\n\n<h1>The Current Solution</h1>\n\n<p>The best I've come up with is this: Have a <code>User</code> model in iOS, have a <code>Student</code> model in iOS which inherits from <code>User</code> and extends it with more properties. Then, have a method which receives a JSON response from the server, and creates <em>either</em> a <code>User</code> or a <code>Student</code> model, depending on the dictinoary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the server will need to always give me the most specific type. I.e., when I log in to the server, it will decide whether I'm a student or just a regular user, and will return me the proper dictionary.</p>\n\n<h1>Is this the best way?</h1>\n\n<p>This sounds a little complicated. But any other way I've thought of modeling it, e.g. changing the way the database is laid out, gives me a design in which the database isn't aware of all the constraints. For example, <code>Student</code> objects are allowed to own other objects (e..g, <code>homework_paper</code>). I can model this with a foreign key to a <code>User</code> object instead of to the <code>Student</code> object, and say that the <code>Student</code> is simply an extension of the user. But then the database doesn't force the fact that a <code>homework_paper</code> has to be owned by a student. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to solve this problem that I'm missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","mysql","api","data","frameworks"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":324,"score":3,"question_id":8466425,"title":"Best Python Web Framework for my API Server Needs","body":"<p>I am working on developing two systems:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A system that will constantly retrieve economic data from a 3rd party data feed and push it into a MySQL DB (using sqlalchemy)  </li>\n<li>A server that will allow anyone to query the data in the db over a JSON AJAX API (similar to Yelp or Yahoo API for example)  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have two main questions:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Which Python framework should I use in 2)?

Now my fear is that if user gets to know (or by guess) that there is some function in my module called B() which can be called directly by bypassing A(), then it can compromise my implementation.</p>\n\n<p>I know that C++ would be better in this case because of public and private methods and I also have an idea that I can prevent B() being called directly by using some flag check of A() in B() but I want to know if there is any other method so that user cant call my functions (like B()) which are not exposed in header file.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["django","api","rest","django-rest-framework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":6,"up_vote_count":18,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1854,"score":18,"question_id":7303313,"title":"What are the differences between django-tastypie and djangorestframework?","body":"<p>Why would you use one over the other, for exposing an API for your Django app?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/\">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie\">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","json","api","data-structures"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":1,"question_id":13174244,"title":"Examples to some complicated JSON tree structures","body":"<p>I am looking to compile a list of JSON feeds publicly available on Internet that are  complicated and have a lot of levels in it.

So, this question is asking about help deciphering the C++ related information from MSDN, and calling it from VB6, but I have detailed below our specific usage, in the hope that it helps.</p>\n\n<p>Our application uses a SIP (Session Initializatio Protocol) stack from a company called Dialogic, that allows us to deal with incoming phone calls, read the DDI number (the number the caller dialled), and their Caller ID (the number the caller is calling from), and to deal with that information updating various records in a database based on the DDI and Caller ID. We have multiple DDI's on various VOIP lines / channels pointing to the same computer. This all works perfectly fine.</p>\n\n<p>Under certain circumstances we make outgoing calls to play a WAV file to supervisor's when a guard or carer hasn't made a visit to a certain location, and called in to record their presence.

The following code gives me an \"invalid_grant\" error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();\nHttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\");\n\ntry {\n    List&lt;NameValuePair&gt; nameValuePairs = new ArrayList&lt;NameValuePair&gt;(5);\n    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"code\", \"CODE\"));\n    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"client_id\", \"CLIENT_ID\"));\n    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"client_secret\", \"CLIENT_SECRET\"));\n    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"redirect_uri\", \"urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob\"));\n    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"grant_type\", \"authorization_code\"));\n    httppost.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs));\n\n    HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);\n    ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Taking out the client_secret entirely gave me an \"invalid_request\" error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","api","oauth"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":12980066,"title":"how to communicate b/w two web applications securely using API?","body":"<p>I have a main website (which contain all data) and multiple client websites which fetch data from the main website.

And what is the scope parameter? An example for how to get a token and what to put in for scope is given in their blogpost to set the scope variable to <code>\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile\"</code> but I still get the same error unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>I also registered my app for the Google API console and enabled the G+ API, do I have to configure something else there, too?</p>\n\n<p>Hope someone can help.

It is a url where one should be redirected after \n\nauthentication. \n\n3) Execute authorize.php. \n\n4) After you autheticate,\nit would take you to \n\nREDIRECT_URL_AFTER_AUTHENTICATION with \"code\" in the query \n\nstring. \n5) Copy that code and execute the authorize.php again with ?\n\ncode='your_code' in the query string. \n6) If everything goes fine, we will get the token and we will set into session and be redirected to get-all-webinars.php \n\nwhich fetches user's all webinars.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class is not complete, I have laid down the basic </p>\n\n<p>foundation, now you can keep on adding the other functions.

Let me try to explain what I want to do: I would like to automatically publish on a page (as the page) some event that are defined on a website (in a kind of agenda). What I miss, I think, is how everything is working together on Facebook side:\n1. the login process: as the application will run in a cron, this should not display a login dialog box.\n2. the access token: application or page one?\n3. the permissions: from my understanding, I need manage_pages (and publish_stream) but not clear how this should be set.</p>\n\n<p>Thx for any clarification and maybe a clear example :o)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","api","amazon-s3","amazon","file-permissions"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":459,"score":1,"question_id":3863477,"title":"How to set the permission on files at the time of Upload through Amazon s3 API","body":"<p>Is there any way to set the file permission at the time of uploading files through Amazon S3 API.</p>\n\n<p>In my current solution i am able to upload the file on my bucket but i can not view the file through the URL which is mentioned in the file properties section.

Except for simple fixed entry points to the application, a client does not assume that any particular actions will be available for any particular resources beyond those described in representations previously received from the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\">Roy Fielding's blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read this as: The client may only request state changes based on the actions made available from the body of the response from the server (the hypertext).</p>\n\n<p>In an HTML world, this makes perfect sense. The client should only be able to request state changes (new actions/pages) based on the links made available to them through the hypertext (HTML).</p>\n\n<p>When the resource is represented in other ways - such as JSON, XML, YAML etc. this is not so apparent.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take an example \"REST\" JSON API:</p>\n\n<p>I create a new resource (a new comment for example) by sending a POST request to</p>\n\n<p><code>/comments.json? # with params...</code></p>\n\n<p>The server responds with:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Headers\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created \nLocation: http://server.com/comments/3\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n... etc.\n\n# Body\n{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Bodacious\",\"body\":\"An awesome comment\",\"post_id\":\"1\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that I can now access this comment at the URI returned in the header: <a href=\"http://server.com/comments/3.json\">http://server.com/comments/3.json</a></p>\n\n<p>When I visit <a href=\"http://server.com/comments/3.json\">http://server.com/comments/3.json</a> I see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Bodacious\",\"body\":\"An awesome comment\",\"post_id\":\"1\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose the API's documentation tells me that I can delete this comment by sending a DELETE request to the same URI. This is fairly common amongst \"REST\" APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>However...</h2>\n\n<p>The response from the server at <code>GET http://server.com/comments/3.json</code> doesn't tell me anything about being able to delete the comment by sending a DELETE request. All it shows me is the resource. </p>\n\n<p>That I can also DELETE a comment with the same URL is something the client knows through out-of-band information (the documentation) and is not discovered and driven by the response from the server.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the client <strong>is</strong> assuming that the DELETE action (and possible others) are available for this resource and this information has not been previously received from the server.</p>\n\n<p>Have I misunderstood HATEOAS or am I right in saying than an API matching the above description would not, in the strict sense, be a REST API?</p>\n\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n\n<p>I'm aware 100% adherence to REST is not always possible or the most pragmatic way to go.

It also returns a instance of a DataManager called DataAccessFactory. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DataAccessFactory {\n    private Client client;\n    private static DataAccessFactory instance;\n    private DataAccessFactory() {\n        client = Client.create();\n    }\n    public static DataAccessFactory getInstance() {\n        /*\n         * check if instance  variable is instantiated.\n         * if it is not then instantiated it and returns\n         * created instance.\n         */\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DataAccessFactory();\n            return instance;\n        } else\n            return instance;\n    }//end getInstance method\n    public DataAccessManager createDataAccessManager() {\n        return new DataAccessManager(client);\n    }//end createDataAccessManager method\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have the actual DataAccessManager class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DataAccessManager {\n    protected Client client;\n    protected DataAccessManager (Client client)n{\n        this.client = client;\n    }//end constructor \n    public &lt;T&gt;  List &lt;Object&gt; getAll(T t) {\n        Data module = new Data ();\n        Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(module);\n        IDataAccess data = (IDataAccess) injector.getInstance(t.getClass());\n        return (List&lt;Object&gt;) data;\n    }//end fetchAllUser method\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To call the user model on this class I would do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void fetchUser () {\n        DataAccessManager m = DataAccessFactory.getInstance().createDataAccessManager();\n        List&lt;User&gt; user = (List&lt;User&gt;)  m.getAll(new Userdata ());\n        if (user == null)\n            assertEquals(1, 2);\n        else\n            assertEquals(1, 1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ideally what I want this to do now is, call the UserData to get all the User objects or the OrderData (When implementation is written) class to get all the order objects etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that this is giving a error: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cannot cast from List to List </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.How can I fix this problem or restructure this so that it makes sense?</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","youtube"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":12959070,"title":"youtube api java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: gNs","body":"<p>I am using the youtube api to get videos.

For every user one request is send to twitter</p>\n\n<p>Currently the system is using REST API (http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.xml?user_id='xxxxxx') that is limiting number of request to 150 per hour. \nWe cannot make authenticated requests as it requires the user to authorise the call every time, which is not possible while making the requests by cron.

I have some HTML with a form (<code>method=\"POST\"</code>) and an <code>&lt;input type=\"file\" ...&gt;</code> element that can submit a file to some PHP code, using the standard multipart/form-data MIME type. The PHP generates the ID and prints it out as its result. Because the PHP simply prints the ID, as opposed to redirecting to another HTML page or generating HTML itself, it is not very pretty, but hopefully is sufficient for the intended use case of a programmatic file submit API.</p>\n\n<p>So far, so good. It gets tricky when I want to have client-side code capture the returned ID and invoke other APIs with it. If the client is a web page with JavaScript, it seems like the client should use <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, but it is not clear to me how to get that object to use the file the user selected with the file input control.</p>\n\n<p>I would love for the same API to work both with manually operated web forms (for easy UI and testing), and purely programmatic invocation (like with JavaScript, curl/libcurl, etc.). I don't want the PHP to issue a redirect to another page with the ID in the query string, and I don't want to return HTML directly. I just want a simple file in, ID out API.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is proving difficult I suspect I am going about things the wrong way.
