Can you please help?</p>\n\n<p>My tasks: I run a process in .Net 4.5 (C#) and generate (generally) value types that I want to use for further analysis in other applications and therefore like to either preserve in-memory or persist on disk. More below. The data is generated within different tasks/threads and thus a row based data format does not lend itself well to match this situation (because the data generated in different threads is generated at different times and is thus not aligned). Thus I thought a columnar data structure may be suitable but please correct me if I am wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<p>Tasks/Thread #1 generates the following data at given time stamps</p>\n\n<p>datetime.ticks / value of output data</p>\n\n<p>1000000001 233.23</p>\n\n<p>1000000002 233.34</p>\n\n<p>1000000006 234.23\n...</p>\n\n<p>Taks/Thread #2 generates the following data at given time stamps</p>\n\n<p>datetime.ticks / value of output data</p>\n\n<p>1000000002 33.32</p>\n\n<p>1000000005 34.34</p>\n\n<p>1000000015 54.32\n...</p>\n\n<p>I do not need to align the time stamps at the .Net run-time, I am first and foremost after preserving the data and to process the data within R or Python at a later point.</p>\n\n<p>My requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Fast writes, fast writes, fast writes: It can happen that I generate 100,000- 1,000,000 data points per second and need to persist (worst case) or retain in memory the data. Its ok to run the writes on its own thread so this process can lag the data generation process but limitation is 16gb RAM (64bit code), more below.</p></li>\n<li><p>Preference is for columnar db format as it lends itself well to how I want to query the data later but I am open to any other structure if it makes sense in regards to the examples above (document/key-value also ok if all other requirements are met, especially in terms of write speed). </p></li>\n<li><p>API that can be referenced from within .Net. Example: HDF5 may be considered capable by some but I find their .Net port horrible.Something that supports .Net a little better would be a plus but if all other requirements are met then I can deal with something similar to the HDF5 .Net port.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Concurrent writes if possible: As described earlier I like to write data concurrently from different tasks/threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am constrained by 16gb memory (run .Net process in 64bit) and thus I probably look for something that is not purely in-memory as I may sometimes generate more data than that. Something in-memory which persists at times or a pure persistence model is probably preferable. </p></li>\n<li><p>Preference for embedded but if a server in a client/server solution can run as a windows service then no issue. </p></li>\n<li><p>In terms of data access I have strong preference for a db solution for which interfaces from R and Python already exist because I like to use the Panda library within Python for time series alignments and other analysis and run analyses within R.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the API/library supports in addition SQL/SQL-like/Linq/ like queries that would be terrific but generally I just need the absolute bare bones such as load columnar data in between start and end date (given the \"key\"/index is in such format) because I analyze and run queries within R/Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>If it comes with a management console or data visualizer that would be a plus but not a must. </p></li>\n<li><p>Should be open source or priced within \"reach\" (no, KDB does not qualify in that regards ;-)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OK, here is what I have so far, and again its all I got because most db solution simply fail already on the write performance requirement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Infobright and Db4o. I like what I read so far but I admit I have not checked into any performance stats</li>\n<li>Something done myself. I can easily store value types in binary format and index the data by datetime.ticks , I just would need to somehow write scripts to load/deserialize the data in Python/R. But it would be a massive tasks if I wanted to add concurrency, a query engine, and other goodies.

The relationship application - user is 1:m. The model is fully partitioned on application. Meaning application is self contained, there is no global pool for users. So in order to find an user I would need to know the application upfront.</p>\n\n<p>Designing the proper REST API for this case I don't find that easy. URIs usual shouldn't be dependent on the way the model is implemented. They should just address the resource. And URIs should be as short as possible, too. </p>\n\n<p>Now I'm thinking about what the URI for a user should look like. Basically I think it would be best to have just</p>\n\n<pre><code>/user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From an outside perspective this should be good. But I want to keep the partitioning of the data so I neither want having a global pool referencing all application users nor I want to search for a user in all the applications available. That means I need to add some context about the application. Making the URI look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>/application/{id}/user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>would solve the problem. While having my model in mind that makes sense. Application and user are composite, meaning the user has no meaning outside of an application. On the other hand I still think user could be a standalone resource. And my ids are UUIDs so the URL would become very long very quick and it is not that nice looking (if this counts as an argument :) )</p>\n\n<p>The third option would be to put an extra header in the HTTP request. It would be like</p>\n\n<pre><code>X-Foo-Application: {id}\nGET /user/{id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how I do it at the moment. Having ids being UUIDs there is no chance (by design of an UUID) that any uri can be exist twice for different resources. But still I'm not sure if that is a proper way to make that compromise between standalone resources and partitioned data. </p>\n\n<p>Or maybe I'm just missing the obvious problem solving approach #4.

Before implementing our current server side script, I tried establishing a stream by using methods found here: <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/thread/905613\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forums.adobe.com/thread/905613</a></p>\n\n<p>I think the method below may work as it would give me an array of subscribers to the stream.</p>\n\n<p>getLiveStreamStats(appInst:String, stream:String) : Object</p>\n\n<p>But the problem is that server returns the following:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;level&gt;error&lt;/level&gt;\n&lt;code&gt;Admin.API.MethodNotAllowed&lt;/code&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;getlivestreams - Method not allowed!&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;timestamp&gt;8/7/2012 10:05:38 AM&lt;/timestamp&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Question - Do I need to do anything different with the client or is it a server setting that needs modification? </p>\n"},{"tags":["api","rest","concurrency"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":1,"question_id":13251659,"title":"Concurrency checking on a REST API?","body":"<p>I'm starting a REST API to make a Web Application.</p>\n\n<p>Most web sites tell you to delete resources issuing a <code>DELETE</code> HTTP request to an URI like <code>/{resource}/{resource-id}</code>.

It says in the Instagram API docs (http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/#receiving-updates) that I should acknowledge the request in less than 2 seconds. Here's how my code looks like in the callback method (PHP CodeIgniter):</p>\n\n<pre><code>if ($_SERVER ['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    header(\"Content-Length: 0\");\n    header(\"Connection: close\");\n    flush();\n\n    // do stuff with file_get_contents('php://input')\n    // also, get new photos...\n\n    $data   = json_decode (file_get_contents('php://input'));\n\n    if (is_array ($data))\n        foreach ($data as $geo) {\n            $this-&gt;db-&gt;query (\"LOGGING SOMETHING HERE...\");\n\n            // make some a cURL request to the geography endpoint\n            // get the photos, save them in the database\n            $this-&gt;live-&gt;updateGeo ($geo-&gt;object_id);\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Q: If I'm missing requests:\n- is it because the callback takes too long due to the added time of $this->live->updateGeo (which waits for the cURL call to end)?\n- is it because my server is in Romania and all the requests from Instagram come from USA IPs?</p>\n\n<p>I've analysed the raw access logs and from time to time I get a spike of requests, then a long span of silence. I'm thinking it's either because Instagram API is not posting anything to me or I'm not responding in less than 2 seconds.

I'm having trouble deciding how to model this.</p>\n\n<h1>The Current Solution</h1>\n\n<p>The best I've come up with is this: Have a <code>User</code> model in iOS, have a <code>Student</code> model in iOS which inherits from <code>User</code> and extends it with more properties. Then, have a method which receives a JSON response from the server, and creates <em>either</em> a <code>User</code> or a <code>Student</code> model, depending on the dictinoary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the server will need to always give me the most specific type. I.e., when I log in to the server, it will decide whether I'm a student or just a regular user, and will return me the proper dictionary.</p>\n\n<h1>Is this the best way?</h1>\n\n<p>This sounds a little complicated. But any other way I've thought of modeling it, e.g. changing the way the database is laid out, gives me a design in which the database isn't aware of all the constraints. For example, <code>Student</code> objects are allowed to own other objects (e..g, <code>homework_paper</code>). I can model this with a foreign key to a <code>User</code> object instead of to the <code>Student</code> object, and say that the <code>Student</code> is simply an extension of the user. But then the database doesn't force the fact that a <code>homework_paper</code> has to be owned by a student. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to solve this problem that I'm missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","mysql","api","data","frameworks"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":324,"score":3,"question_id":8466425,"title":"Best Python Web Framework for my API Server Needs","body":"<p>I am working on developing two systems:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A system that will constantly retrieve economic data from a 3rd party data feed and push it into a MySQL DB (using sqlalchemy)  </li>\n<li>A server that will allow anyone to query the data in the db over a JSON AJAX API (similar to Yelp or Yahoo API for example)  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have two main questions:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Which Python framework should I use in 2)?

It always reports the correct graphics card memory, which is normally at least 256 MB on our systems.</p>\n\n<p>However, on a particular system (Windows 7, 64 bit, with an NVidia Quadro FX 570) our tool reports that the graphics card has 0 bytes memory, which is clearly incorrect, since our software requires at least 256 MB graphics card memory, and it runs fine on that computer.</p>\n\n<p>The query is performed using an <code>IWbemServices</code> object <code>s</code>, on which we call</p>\n\n<pre><code>IEnumWbemClassObject* pEnum = NULL;\ns-&gt;ExecQuery(\"WQL\",\n             \"SELECT AdapterRAM FROM Win32_VideoController\",\n             WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY | WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY,\n             NULL,\n             &amp;pEnum);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By debugging the application in Visual Studio, I verified that <code>ExecQuery()</code> returns without an error but, on this particular system, unlike on all other systems it reports 0 bytes memory.</p>\n\n<p>This is all the information I could gather by debugging the application in Visual Studio (unfortunately it is not possible to step into the call to <code>ExecQuery()</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Question 1. What can possibly go wrong by running this query and are there alternative ways to use <code>ExecQuery()</code> that might correct the problem (using different parameters)?</p>\n\n<p>Question 2. Are there alternative methods to retrieve information about the graphics card memory that could be used in case <code>ExecQuery()</code> does not work properly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","api","activeresource","rails-roar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13159314,"title":"Consuming REST API Rails","body":"<p>I've looked at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5386232/consuming-rest-api-from-rails-application\">this</a> question but it's quite old and I feel there's now other alternatives to ARes.</p>\n\n<p>Given that many people seem to think that ActiveResource is kind of outdated and heavyweight, I've looked at <a href=\"https://github.com/filtersquad/api_smith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Api Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/remiprev/her\" rel=\"nofollow\">Her</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/apotonick/roar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roar</a> and of course ARes. </p>\n\n<p>Which one of these gems would be the most reliable, and future proof alternative? </p>\n"},{"tags":["api","magento"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":24,"score":-1,"question_id":13154239,"title":"Magento api2.xml syntax reference","body":"<p>I would like to access a good tutorial to help me code an api2.xml file.

Uses the consumer and token object created above.\n$oauthrequest = OAuthRequest::from_consumer_and_token($consumer, $token, 'GET', $unsigned_url);\n\n// Sign the request\n$oauthrequest-&gt;sign_request($signature_method, $consumer, $token);\n\n// Get the signed URL\n$signed_url = $oauthrequest-&gt;to_url();\n\n// Send Yelp API Call\n$ch = curl_init($signed_url);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);\n$data = curl_exec($ch); // Yelp response\ncurl_close($ch);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this seems excessive to be doing in EVERY page when I want to call a certain business.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","api","qt","internet-connection"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":2,"question_id":13035493,"title":"Control internet connection","body":"<p>I am trying to develop an application (C++/Qt preferably for multi-platform) that controls and filters the data stream entering and leaving the network (mainly internet), and restricts access to certain URLs in the browser.</p>\n\n<p>Is that possible with Qt?

I used this and the CIE URL to get rates, print shipping labels, etc.  So far so good.  Everything works.  I have been able to build and test desktop and web GUIs that use UPS API.</p>\n\n<p>Now I understand that I need to implement UPS Registration API and Licensing API to apply for certification.  I applied with UPS for this and received the API package.  Again, so far so good.  Now, I have two questions:</p>\n\n<p>1- I understand that we can use the Registration API to authenticate existing UPS accounts for end users to access my application.  We can also use it to allow the end user to create one or more new UPS accounts for use with the application.  If Registration API takes care of this, what is the use of the Licensing API?  UPS documentation isn't widely available and the documentation that comes with the API kit is very minimal.</p>\n\n<p>2- My app will use the end users' UPS account numbers for shipping, but which Access Key should it use?  Should it use the Access Key of each end user, or my Access Key for everyone?  If the former, then should this end-user Access Key be obtained using the Licensing API?  Is that the Licensign API's purpose?</p>\n\n<p>In essence, I think both questions are the same but you can see how perplexed I am with respect to this requirement of implementing Registration and Licensing APIs!</p>\n\n<p>Any insight from you experts would be REALLY great!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nJust wanted to add another question: </p>\n\n<p>3- I am using UPS Web Services for all UPS functionality.  The package that contains Licensing API and Registration API has a \"Reference.cs\" for the Registration API but not for Licensing API (only XSDs in that folder).  Is the Licensing API not available as Web Service?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","api","parsing","web"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":35,"score":-4,"question_id":13090816,"title":"Creating a web application","body":"<p>I want to create a web application that can display data using a dashboard style. \nData will be pulled from numerous API calls from other sources such as Twitter, Facebook etc in XML format.\nThe Data needs to then be processed and displayed onto my dashboard web application.</p>\n\n<p>My question is (I'm not a software engineer, so question may seem juvenile or vague, please forgive me)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is the best language/tool to use to parse the data?</p></li>\n<li><p>What is the best language/tool for developing this web application</p></li>\n<li>What is my best starting point?

And what is the scope parameter? An example for how to get a token and what to put in for scope is given in their blogpost to set the scope variable to <code>\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile\"</code> but I still get the same error unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>I also registered my app for the Google API console and enabled the G+ API, do I have to configure something else there, too?</p>\n\n<p>Hope someone can help.

It is a url where one should be redirected after \n\nauthentication. \n\n3) Execute authorize.php. \n\n4) After you autheticate,\nit would take you to \n\nREDIRECT_URL_AFTER_AUTHENTICATION with \"code\" in the query \n\nstring. \n5) Copy that code and execute the authorize.php again with ?\n\ncode='your_code' in the query string. \n6) If everything goes fine, we will get the token and we will set into session and be redirected to get-all-webinars.php \n\nwhich fetches user's all webinars.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class is not complete, I have laid down the basic </p>\n\n<p>foundation, now you can keep on adding the other functions.

Let me try to explain what I want to do: I would like to automatically publish on a page (as the page) some event that are defined on a website (in a kind of agenda). What I miss, I think, is how everything is working together on Facebook side:\n1. the login process: as the application will run in a cron, this should not display a login dialog box.\n2. the access token: application or page one?\n3. the permissions: from my understanding, I need manage_pages (and publish_stream) but not clear how this should be set.</p>\n\n<p>Thx for any clarification and maybe a clear example :o)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","api","amazon-s3","amazon","file-permissions"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":459,"score":1,"question_id":3863477,"title":"How to set the permission on files at the time of Upload through Amazon s3 API","body":"<p>Is there any way to set the file permission at the time of uploading files through Amazon S3 API.</p>\n\n<p>In my current solution i am able to upload the file on my bucket but i can not view the file through the URL which is mentioned in the file properties section.

Except for simple fixed entry points to the application, a client does not assume that any particular actions will be available for any particular resources beyond those described in representations previously received from the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\">Roy Fielding's blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read this as: The client may only request state changes based on the actions made available from the body of the response from the server (the hypertext).</p>\n\n<p>In an HTML world, this makes perfect sense. The client should only be able to request state changes (new actions/pages) based on the links made available to them through the hypertext (HTML).</p>\n\n<p>When the resource is represented in other ways - such as JSON, XML, YAML etc. this is not so apparent.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take an example \"REST\" JSON API:</p>\n\n<p>I create a new resource (a new comment for example) by sending a POST request to</p>\n\n<p><code>/comments.json? # with params...</code></p>\n\n<p>The server responds with:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Headers\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created \nLocation: http://server.com/comments/3\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n... etc.\n\n# Body\n{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Bodacious\",\"body\":\"An awesome comment\",\"post_id\":\"1\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that I can now access this comment at the URI returned in the header: <a href=\"http://server.com/comments/3.json\">http://server.com/comments/3.json</a></p>\n\n<p>When I visit <a href=\"http://server.com/comments/3.json\">http://server.com/comments/3.json</a> I see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Bodacious\",\"body\":\"An awesome comment\",\"post_id\":\"1\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose the API's documentation tells me that I can delete this comment by sending a DELETE request to the same URI. This is fairly common amongst \"REST\" APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>However...</h2>\n\n<p>The response from the server at <code>GET http://server.com/comments/3.json</code> doesn't tell me anything about being able to delete the comment by sending a DELETE request. All it shows me is the resource. </p>\n\n<p>That I can also DELETE a comment with the same URL is something the client knows through out-of-band information (the documentation) and is not discovered and driven by the response from the server.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the client <strong>is</strong> assuming that the DELETE action (and possible others) are available for this resource and this information has not been previously received from the server.</p>\n\n<p>Have I misunderstood HATEOAS or am I right in saying than an API matching the above description would not, in the strict sense, be a REST API?</p>\n\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n\n<p>I'm aware 100% adherence to REST is not always possible or the most pragmatic way to go.

It also returns a instance of a DataManager called DataAccessFactory. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DataAccessFactory {\n    private Client client;\n    private static DataAccessFactory instance;\n    private DataAccessFactory() {\n        client = Client.create();\n    }\n    public static DataAccessFactory getInstance() {\n        /*\n         * check if instance  variable is instantiated.\n         * if it is not then instantiated it and returns\n         * created instance.\n         */\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DataAccessFactory();\n            return instance;\n        } else\n            return instance;\n    }//end getInstance method\n    public DataAccessManager createDataAccessManager() {\n        return new DataAccessManager(client);\n    }//end createDataAccessManager method\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have the actual DataAccessManager class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DataAccessManager {\n    protected Client client;\n    protected DataAccessManager (Client client)n{\n        this.client = client;\n    }//end constructor \n    public &lt;T&gt;  List &lt;Object&gt; getAll(T t) {\n        Data module = new Data ();\n        Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(module);\n        IDataAccess data = (IDataAccess) injector.getInstance(t.getClass());\n        return (List&lt;Object&gt;) data;\n    }//end fetchAllUser method\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To call the user model on this class I would do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void fetchUser () {\n        DataAccessManager m = DataAccessFactory.getInstance().createDataAccessManager();\n        List&lt;User&gt; user = (List&lt;User&gt;)  m.getAll(new Userdata ());\n        if (user == null)\n            assertEquals(1, 2);\n        else\n            assertEquals(1, 1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ideally what I want this to do now is, call the UserData to get all the User objects or the OrderData (When implementation is written) class to get all the order objects etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that this is giving a error: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cannot cast from List to List </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.How can I fix this problem or restructure this so that it makes sense?</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","youtube"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":12959070,"title":"youtube api java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: gNs","body":"<p>I am using the youtube api to get videos.

It provides a feature that shows tweets posted by members of your office if they have authorised the site.\nThe fetching of tweets is done by a periodic cron that is run at a regular interval at about 15 minutes. This cron searches for all the users who have authorised the site's app\nand makes requests twitter for their tweets. For every user one request is send to twitter</p>\n\n<p>Currently the system is using REST API (http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.xml?user_id='xxxxxx') that is limiting number of request to 150 per hour. \nWe cannot make authenticated requests as it requires the user to authorise the call every time, which is not possible while making the requests by cron.

I have some HTML with a form (<code>method=\"POST\"</code>) and an <code>&lt;input type=\"file\" ...&gt;</code> element that can submit a file to some PHP code, using the standard multipart/form-data MIME type. The PHP generates the ID and prints it out as its result. Because the PHP simply prints the ID, as opposed to redirecting to another HTML page or generating HTML itself, it is not very pretty, but hopefully is sufficient for the intended use case of a programmatic file submit API.</p>\n\n<p>So far, so good. It gets tricky when I want to have client-side code capture the returned ID and invoke other APIs with it. If the client is a web page with JavaScript, it seems like the client should use <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, but it is not clear to me how to get that object to use the file the user selected with the file input control.</p>\n\n<p>I would love for the same API to work both with manually operated web forms (for easy UI and testing), and purely programmatic invocation (like with JavaScript, curl/libcurl, etc.). I don't want the PHP to issue a redirect to another page with the ID in the query string, and I don't want to return HTML directly. I just want a simple file in, ID out API.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is proving difficult I suspect I am going about things the wrong way.

At that stage though, at least some cassettes get recorded, so I just continually run the test suite until eventually I get them all recorded and the suite can run using only cassettes (my <code>default_cassette_options = { record: :new_episodes }</code>).

At the moment, if a call to an external service that doesn't have a cassette already is the final test in the suite, then the suite sleeps unnecessarily for 1 second.  Likewise, if the time between 2 web service calls without cassettes in the test suite is more than once second, then there's another unnecessary pause.  Has anyone made any kind of logic to test for these kinds of conditions, or is there a way to elegantly do this in the VCR configuration?</p>\n"},{"tags":["api","google","geolocation","maps","address"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":537,"score":0,"question_id":8946419,"title":"Google API: Find the complete address using civic number & postal code","body":"<p>On many government sites in Canada, they have a feature where they can know your address only by the postal code and the street name.</p>\n\n<p>When you search a postal code on google map, the area covered by this postal code is covered.</p>\n\n<p>But looking at the google map API, I can't find a way to get a complete address based only on the postal code and the civic number.</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","json","api"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":12874329,"title":"Giantbomb API to JSON","body":"<p>Iam having some serious trouble parsing data from Giantbomb.

The application works almost as intended, but there remains a major problem. This problem seems to be specific to the use of Fan Page albums. We have created a FB account that has 2 Fan Pages, each with 3 user albums. However, several of the albums have the flag can_upload set to false. </p>\n\n<p>So the first set of questions is how does this flag get set? And why would it be set to false for user albums? Can it be reset by the user or some other way?</p>\n\n<p>In our 6 Fan Page albums (2 Fan Pages, 3 albums each) 1 album has the flag set \"correctly\", that is can_upload=true. For this album we can upload images and text as expected. 5 of the albums have can_upload set to false. However, we can upload images and text to 3 of these albums as well (i do not understand why this is). 2 of the albums do not allow us to upload images (this makes sense, given that the can_upload is set to false, or so it seems to me).</p>\n\n<p>So the second question is what does this flag actually do? Is it only sometimes used? Is there a bug in Facebook that causes it to work sporadically? </p>\n\n<p>If the can_upload flag worked as expected, we could simply filter out the Fan Page albums that have it set to false.

She's so beautiful that there are  N  princes proposing to her (needless to say,  N  could be as large as 100). After lots of consideration, Josephine  and her parents realized that all these princes are perfect, so that it is impossible to choose one and reject  the  others with a good reason. They decided that Josephine would not reject the one chosen by Fate, while other princes could not ask for a fairer decision.\nN princes, numbered from 1..N, are asked to stand in a circle. Our beautiful princess would choose a random number  K  and begin to find her  fiancé  with that number. Starting from the first person, she counted to K, and removed that  K-th person from the circle. Then, she starts counting from the next \nperson and removes the  K-th person. This process is repeated until all candidates are removed but The Chosen One.\nEverything has been prepared, except one minor problem. To be sure that the processes are random enough, Josephine chose a large number  K  (around 100). As the result, counting and removing one princess after another would be a painful process.  She leaves this work to you  –  the Royal Programmer.</p>\n\n<p>Given  N  and  K, your program should print out the numbers of princes in the order that they are removed from the circle. The last number would be The Chosen One.\nInput. The first line consist of T,  the  number of test cases,  T  &lt;=  100. The following T  lines describe  T  test cases, each line containing two integers, N and K.\nOutput One line for each test case consists of princes’  numbers  in the indicated order. For each output number, it is followed by a whitespace.</p>\n\n<p>Sample Input<br>\n2 (Number of cases)<br>\n3 1  (Input 1)<br>\n4 2  (Input 2)                  </p>\n\n<p>Sample Output</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3     (Output of input 1)</p>\n\n<p>2 4 3 1   (Output of input 2)</p>\n\n<p>Explanation</p>\n\n<p>Test case 1:\n  Starting from 1.

However, using an existing XML API also requires that all names and text appearing in the EXI document be converted into strings. In the future, more efficiency might be achievable if the higher layers could directly use these data as typed values appearing in the EXI document. For instance, if a higher layer needs typed data, going through its string form can produce a performance penalty, so an extended API that supports typed data directly could improve performance when used with EXI. </p>\n  \n  <p>from: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand it as following: <i>\"Using EXI with existing APIs?\nNo performance gain!

I'm thinking through the tradeoffs of various ways of versioning our REST Web Services and I would like to find out what others have learned when it comes to versioning REST web services.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of good discussions on SO and other places about versioning web services, but most of them focus on whether to put the version number in the URL or the request header.</p>\n\n<p>Versioning web services has multiple aspects to it.  There is specifying the version in the web service call itself (URL or header).  There is managing multiple versions of business logic in  source code.  There is building versioned web services.  There are version control issues. And there is the matter of how to deprecate and drop obsolete versions.</p>\n\n<p>Our partner who is writing our mobile clients wants to put the version in the URL so that is my approach (for now).  In addition, the new versions of these web services may not be compatible with the old versions.  For example there may be a different security implementation in different versions.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to versioned URLs two approaches are usually suggested - put the verion number in the URL or make it a parameter</p>\n\n<pre><code>context-root/service/rest/v0.1/restMethod/param1\n\ncontext-root/service/rest/restMethod/param1?version=v0.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The second method requires some controller logic to route the request to the right implementation, but that's not difficult.  The choice between the two isn't difficult.</p>\n\n<p>A third option is to put the version number in the context-root itself which means putting it in the .war filename prefix or in the deployment descriptor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>restarchive-v0.1/service/rest/restMethod/param1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would mean deploying multiple archives for all versions currently supported.</p>\n\n<p>I like having version numbers in filenames.  It makes it easy to see what is deployed.  The downside to this approach is that it requires a seperate build for each versioned archive, maybe with maven profiles.  </p>\n\n<p>Here's what the code for the first approach could look like.  Each web method does it's own controller logic for all supported versions for that method.  Business logic for each version can be handled a sensible way (i.e. put the version number in the package).</p>\n\n<pre><code>    @ApplicationPath(\"/service/rest\")\n    @Path(\"/{version}/\")\n    public class RestService extends Application {\n\n    @GET\n    @Path(\"/user/{id}\")\n    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n    public User getUser(@PathParam(\"version\") String version, @PathParam(\"id\") int id) {\n\n        User user;\n        if (version.equals(\"v0.1\")) {\n            //  call v0.1 code to get the User\n         }\n         else if (version.equals(\"v0.2\")) {\n            //  call v0.2 code to get the User\n         }\n         else {\n\n             throw new WebApplicationException(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND);\n         }\n\n         return user;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My first implementation of this used multiple subclasses of javax.ws.rs.core.Application in different packages with the version number in the package.  That should work, but the JBoss RESTeasy implementation doesn't allow multiple subclasses of Application in one .war.  That apparently is a violation of the JAX-RS 1.1 specification, but it's a limitation you'll have to live with if you use JBoss or RESTeasy.</p>\n\n<p>I'm inclined to use the first approach with an implementation similar to the one above.  Since I'm trying to minimize problems in the future I would like to hear what others have learned through experience with the various aspects of version web services.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a sound approach, or will it lead to problems that I haven't mentioned here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["facebook","api"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":109,"score":2,"question_id":10600595,"title":"Facebook graph api DfsException: I fail at picking lvols","body":"<p>today I got this exception from php facebok api call in unchanged code which was OK in previous days:</p>\n\n<p><strong>DfsException: I fail at picking lvols :(</strong></p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help or explain, what it means?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","api","gem","linkedin"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":10768790,"title":"How to aceess linked api security code using server to server call in ruby on rails","body":"<p>I am using Ruby on Rails(3.2.3) and omniauth/linkedin gems</p>\n\n<p>I have authorized my web application from the user .

I need some help with S3 storage solution. Here's my problem.</p>\n\n<p>I am writing an API for an iOS app where the users login with the Facebook API on iOS. The server validates the user against the token Facebook issues to the iOS user and issues a temporary Session token. From this point the user needs to download content that is stored in S3. This content only belongs to the user and a subset of his friends. This user can add more content to S3 which can be accessed by the same bunch of people. I guess it is similar to attaching a file to a Facebook group...</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 ways a user can interact with S3... leave it to the server or get the server to issue a temporary S3 token (not sure of the possibilities here) and the user can hit up on the content URLs directly to S3.

Which works, for the most part.</p>\n\n<pre><code>InputStream source = retrieveStream(url);\n\n        Gson gson = new Gson();\n\n        Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(source);\n\n        MovieObject mObject = gson.fromJson(reader, MovieObject.class); //Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT instead. Something to do with the Rating object I believe.\n\n        Toast.makeText(this, mObject.title, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n        Toast.makeText(this, mObject.synopsis,Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem arises when I try to do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Rating&gt; ratings = mObject.ratings;\nfor (Rating rating : ratings) {\n    Toast.makeText(this, rating.criticsScore,Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Error being - Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT at line 28 column 362</p>\n\n<p>If I comment out the part in MovieObject where I declare the Ratings variable... things work. So that seems to be the issue. BUT I'm not sure how to get around that. Would it be easier to just do native Android JSON parsing instead of trying to use GSON? Or mess with Jackson? </p>\n\n<p>For reference, here is the api viewer for the Rotten Tomatoes response: <a href=\"http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/#http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770672122.json?apikey=vg2cj5tgqmbkkxz2vgyxqyh9\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/#http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770672122.json?apikey=vg2cj5tgqmbkkxz2vgyxqyh9</a></p>\n\n<p>Any help would be great, as I've been stuck on this for a few days.. and apparently can't figure it out :(</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","api","soap"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":12631187,"title":"esendex.com SMS Soap API and Unicode","body":"<p>I'm trying to implement a sms sender in java for esendex.com.

Google isn't a great example for this question but a lot of other websites don't have an api that you can use to search their website. Even when they do, it is usually to pull data into your website, whereas I would like to just open the 3rd party website using passing in a user search parameter. This method of manipulating the url usually works as long as you delete other parameters after the search word. Just hoping for some opinion on this practice and how it might be viewed in regards to typical website terms of service. Thanks and sorry if this is a totally ignorant question. Any other suggestions to accomplish passing in search criteria and opening 3rd party websites without an api that allows this would be greatly appreciated. </p>\n"},{"tags":["django","api","authentication","oauth-2.0","oauth-provider"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":2,"question_id":12594745,"title":"Error on Configuring Django-oauth-plus","body":"<p>I am getting a <strong>400 error</strong> when i try the example in the <a href=\"http://code.larlet.fr/django-oauth-plus/wiki/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>settings.py\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n'oauth_provider',\n'django.contrib.auth',\n)\n\nOAUTH_SIGNATURE_METHODS = ['hmac-sha1',]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when i do this</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from oauth_provider.models import Resource, Consumer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource = Resource(name='photos', url='/oauth/photo/')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource.save()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; CONSUMER_KEY = 'dpf43f3p2l4k3l03'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; CONSUMER_SECRET = 'kd94hf93k423kf44'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer = Consumer(key=CONSUMER_KEY, secret=CONSUMER_SECRET,\n...                     name='http://127.0.0.1:9000', user=jane)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer.save()\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.test.client import Client\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Client()\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import time\n&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters = {\n...

Something similar to ODBC or OLE-DB, except for cloud storage instead of databases.</p>\n\n<p>Such that, if I wrote a front end for taking notes, and I utilized such an API, and let the user provide configuration for which cloud storage provider they have an account with, the API library would handle translating my cloud.Save() call into the commands specific to whiever provider was being utilized.  This would allow my front-end app to be cloud storage provider agnostic.</p>\n\n<p>So maybe I wrote some chrome extension or portable thumb drive app for storing notes, or encrypting and storing passwords, or some such, and you tell it which cloud storage provider you have an account with, and it uses it for syncing.  This way your use of that tool doesn't tie you to a specific cloud provider.   As long as you backup your data, you could migrate to another provider and just reconfigure the app should you become unhappy with that provider or they go bankrupt.</p>\n\n<p>WebDAV for example is one potential candidate since it seems some storage services offer it, but that is not quite what I have in mind, since it depends on the storage providers to offer that as an option.  I also don't know enough about WebDAV to know if it really would serve in the capacity I'm imagining.  But feel free to post that as an option with pros/cons for comment/discussion.</p>\n\n<p>I more imagine something that is a middle layer external to each cloud provider.  Of course since each provider offers a different web service for interacting with files, the middle layer would have adapter for each backend.  But on the front-end, it would expose a common API that is provider agnostic.</p>\n\n<p>Does anything of this type exist?  </p>\n\n<p>Even just an open source GUI that allows you to store files in any provider, which would imply that in its source code exists the beginnings of such a middle layer.  I would think someone has already made a tool that helps you unify all the free GB that you can get from various services.  Sort of a JBOD layer for the cloud(although that is not the goal of this post, the point being such a tool accessing many different services would imply it has the beginnings of a middle layer for standardizing access to them).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My main interest though is in abstractions for personal cloud storage services, that would be appropriate for applications used by individuals, to put the control of storage in the hands of the individual so that they can have the freedom to move between personal cloud storage services.</strong> It seems what I've found so far is more oriented for CDN, websites, or services.</p>\n\n<p>Please make seperate posts per suggestion so that votes and comments/discussion can take place specific to that suggestion.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","api","soundcloud","oath2.0"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12575075,"title":"Creating FollowMe link SoundCloud","body":"<p>I'm trying to create a simple FollowMe link for our Company and I am having a problem with the case when a user does not allow pop-ups.
