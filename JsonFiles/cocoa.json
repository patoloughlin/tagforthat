I have an AppController Class that manages this and works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@interface AppController : NSObject\n\n@property (weak) IBOutlet NSView *ourView;\n@property (strong) NSViewController *ourViewController;\n\n- (IBAction)changeView:(id)sender;\n- (IBAction)start:(id)sender;\n- (void)changeViewContoller:(NSInteger)tag;\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When a new view is swapped out for another, the ourViewController property will be updated to point to that view's controller class. Every view controller class will have a method all named the same thing, for example \"action\". This method is supposed to change something on a view.</p>\n\n<p>So the \"start\" method in AppController class will then call the \"action\" method on the ourViewController property. To do this I used the objc_msgSend() method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>objc_msgSend(self.ourViewController, action);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed an NSLog() in the \"action\" method for each ViewController, to see if it was working, and it does, however the \"action\" method is also supposed to change a label's string value, but it does not. If anyone knows why the view is not being updated, that would be extremely helpful.

During drag and drop, I'd like to make it so that a gap for the item-to-be-dropped opens up at the location under the mouse. GarageBand does something like this when you drag to reorder tracks (video here: <a href=\"http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl</a>).

My first thought was to double the height of the row under the mouse during a drag by sending <code>-noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code> in my data source's <code>-tableView:validateDrop:...</code> method, then returning twice the normal height in <code>-tableView:heightOfRow:</code>. Unfortunately, best I can tell, NSTableView doesn't update its layout during drag and drop, so despite calling <code>noteHeightOfRowsWithIndexesChanged:</code>, the row height isn't actually updated.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I'm using a view-based NSTableView, but my rows are not so complex that I couldn't move to a cell-based table view if doing so helped accomplish this. I'm aware of the easy, built-in ability to animate a gap for the dropped item after a drag is complete. I'm looking for a way to open a gap while the drag is in progress. Also, this is for an app to be sold in the Mac App Store, so it must not use private API.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've just filed an enhancement request with Apple requesting built in support for this behavior: <a href=\"http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openradar.appspot.com/12662624</a>.

This seems like an unnecessary hack to me.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: Is there any way to make custom bindings that work as well as the ones made by Apple, without using undocumented features?

However, the <code>NSObject</code> implementation of <code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> half works. It propogates changes from bindee to binder (i.e. from model/controller to view), but doesn't work the opposite way. Also, although the bindee is obviously being observed, <code>observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:</code> is never triggered.</p>\n\n<p>Example project here: <a href=\"http://www.tomdalling.com/wp-content/BindingsTest.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tomdalling.com/wp-content/BindingsTest.zip</a></p>\n\n<p>Apple's documentation indicates that you do, in fact, have to override <code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> to implement manual bindings.

NSAutounbinder is a non-retaining proxy for the NSWindowController object. It is non-retaining to avoid the retain cycle problem.</p>\n\n<p>When -[NSWindowController release] is called and retainCount == 1, The NSAutounbinder unbinds all bindings to itself. This ensures that there are no dangling pointers to the object before it is deallocated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","cocoa","osx-mountain-lion","finder"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13259941,"title":"\"Virtual Files\" in OSX Finder that only appear when my Application runs, possible?","body":"<p>is there a way to \"hook\" into the OSX Finder to perform the following:</p>\n\n<p>When my Application starts, the User sees a Folder in his Finder which is created by my application.

Doing this lets you\n  retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>To add a custom object to the library, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>In your window, configure the object as you would like it.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface\n  Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Fill in the information about your object and press OK.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.\n  When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single\n  item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library\n  creates all of the original objects.</p>\n  \n  <p>The items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder\n  sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a\n  custom item from the Library window, do the following:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Select the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Select your custom item.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Press the Delete key.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>You must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to\n  remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom\n  group folders removes them from the group but not the library.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,\n  you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an\n  Interface Builder plug-in. Plug-ins are typically used in situations\n  where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your\n  custom classes. For more information, see “Using Plug-ins to Integrate\n  New Objects into the Library.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","cocoa","skype"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12701405,"title":"cocoa - Import skype.framework has an error","body":"<p>I have an issue when import skype.framework to mac app.\nThis is the error</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"_OBJC_CLASS_$_SkypeAPI\", referenced from:\n     objc-class-ref in AppDelegate.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Although, I have added the skype.framework.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","osx","cocoa","core-data"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13170712,"title":"EXC_BAD_ACCESS error when using Core Data when changing attribute value","body":"<p>Im pretty new to Core Data programming and Cocoa in general, so no wonder I'm having troubles :)</p>\n\n<p>So here is my managedObjectModel method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (NSManagedObjectModel *)managedObjectModel\n{\n    if (managedObjectModel != nil)\n    {\n        return managedObjectModel;\n    }\n    NSString *modelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"Model\" ofType:@\"momd\"];\n    NSURL *modelURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:modelPath];\n\n    NSAssert(modelURL != nil,@\"modelURL == nil\");\n    managedObjectModel = [[NSManagedObjectModel alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:modelURL];\n    return managedObjectModel;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the part of the code that crashes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSManagedObjectModel *mom = [self managedObjectModel];\n\nmanagedObjectModel = mom;\n\nif (applicationLogDirectory() == nil)\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Could not find application logs directory\\nExiting...\");\n    exit(1);\n}\n\nNSManagedObjectContext *moc = [self managedObjectContext];\nNSProcessInfo *processInfo = [NSProcessInfo processInfo];\n\nNSEntityDescription *newShotEntity = [[mom entitiesByName] objectForKey:@\"Entity\"];\n\nEntity *shEnt = [[Entity alloc] initWithEntity:newShotEntity insertIntoManagedObjectContext:moc];\n\n\nshEnt.pid = [processInfo processIdentifier]; // EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x28ae) here !!!\n\nNSError *error;\n\nif (![moc save: &amp;error])\n{\n   NSLog(@\"Error while saving\\n%@\",\n        ([error localizedDescription] != nil) ?

The unmanaged object will persist persist forever (I think? dealloc never called), and the managed object will be harvested early.  Seems to be lose-lose all-around, but runs in practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Saves a reference of the managed object.  The unmanaged object is left alone, and dealloc appears to be invoked at a reasonable time by the caller.  At this point the managed object is released and disposed.  This seems reasonable, but on the downside the base type's dealloc won't be run (I think?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Increases the retain count and saves a reference.  Unmanaged and managed objects leak forever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Extends Method 3 by adding a cleanup function that is run periodically (e.g. during Init of each new ImageAndTextCell object).  The cleanup function checks the retain counts of the stored objects.  A retain count of 1 means the caller has released it, so we should as well.  Should eliminate leaking in theory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 5:</strong> Attempt to invoke the copyWithZone method on the base type, and then construct a new ImageAndTextView object with the resulting handle.  Seems to do the right thing (the base data is cloned).  Internally, NSObject bumps the retain count on objects constructed like this, so we also use the PeriodicCleanup function to release these objects when they're no longer used.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, I believe Method 5 is the best approach since it should be the only one that results in a truly correct copy of the base type data, but I don't know if the approach is inherently dangerous (I am also making some assumptions about the underlying implementation of NSObject).  So far nothing bad has happened \"yet\", but if anyone is able to vet my analysis then I would be more confident going forward.</p>\n"},{"tags":["cocoa","cocoa-bindings","key-value-coding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":1,"question_id":13235524,"title":"How to be notified of changes to an NSMutableArray bound to an NSArrayController?","body":"<p>I have an NSArrayController who's content array is bound to File's Owner (my window controller) with the model key path is set to chartData.events chartData is a subclass of NSObject and events is a synthesized NSMutableArray property.</p>\n\n<p>chartData needs to know when the NSArrayController adds and removes event objects to the events property.

Here's some code and logs.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the \"Shift\" entity is created and given a date:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (NSMutableArray *)arrayWithDateStartingAtDate:(NSDate *)anyDate forNumberOfDays:(NSUInteger)days;\n{\n    NSCalendar *gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];\n    NSMutableArray *monthArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n    NSDateComponents *comps = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];\n    NSDate *tempDate;\n\n    NSManagedObjectContext *moc = [[CSEventStore sharedStore] managedObjectContext];\n\n    for (NSUInteger i = 0; i &lt; days; i++) {\n        [comps setDay:i];\n        tempDate = [gregorian dateByAddingComponents:comps toDate:anyDate options:0];\n        Shift *shiftRDO = [Shift initShiftEntityRDOWithDate:tempDate InContext:moc];\n        [shiftRDO setShiftRotation:_shiftRotation];\n\n        NSMutableDictionary *dateDict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:tempDate, @\"date\", shiftRDO, @\"shift\", nil];\n        [monthArray addObject:dateDict];\n    }\n\n    return monthArray;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is where the call is made to update it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[shiftEntity updateWithShiftType:_selectedShiftType inContext:context];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which calls the method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)updateWithShiftType:(ShiftType *)shiftType inContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context\n{\n    self.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\",shiftType.title];\n    self.symbol = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\",shiftType.symbol];\n    self.startTime = [shiftType.startTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.endTime = [shiftType.endTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.splitStartTime = [shiftType.splitStartTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.splitEndTime = [shiftType.splitEndTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:0];\n    self.isWorkday = [shiftType.isWorkday copy];\n    self.isTimeOff = [shiftType.isTimeOff copy];\n    self.typeID = [shiftType typeID];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the above code executes, the first notification is posted in the log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Shift: 0x8140b70&gt; (entity: Shift; id: 0x81409e0 &lt;x-coredata:///Shift/tE59A199A-444E-4079-BD8C-0D3E734607783&gt; ; data: {\ndate = \"2012-10-29 04:00:00 +0000\";\nendTime = \"2012-11-02 19:35:38 +0000\";\nisTimeOff = 0;\nisWorkday = 1;\nshiftRotation = \"0x81406a0 &lt;x-coredata:///ShiftRotation/tE59A199A-444E-4079-BD8C-0D3E734607782&gt;\";\nsplitEndTime = nil;\nsplitStartTime = nil;\nstartTime = \"2012-11-02 09:35:34 +0000\";\nsymbol = none;\ntitle = Days;\ntypeID = \"991ACC8C-ECE0-4555-9002-7AC233F26CBF\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The \"<strong>date</strong>\" property does have the proper assigned date.</p>\n\n<p>Now as soon as I save the context with the following method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (BOOL)saveContext\n{\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    if (__managedObjectContext) {\n        if ([__managedObjectContext hasChanges] &amp;&amp; ![__managedObjectContext save:&amp;error]) {\n            NSLog(@\"Unresolved error %@, %@\", error, [error userInfo]);\n\n            // More details on error\n            NSArray* detailedErrors = [error userInfo][NSDetailedErrorsKey];\n            if(detailedErrors != nil &amp;&amp; [detailedErrors count] &gt; 0) {\n                for(NSError* detailedError in detailedErrors) {\n                    NSLog(@\"  DetailedError: %@\", [detailedError userInfo]);\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                NSLog(@\"  %@\", [error userInfo]);\n            }\n\n            return NO;\n            abort();\n        }\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I receive a second notification of a change with the following log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;Shift: 0x8140b70&gt; (entity: Shift; id: 0x82c9dd0 &lt;x-coredata://7CE834F9-5056-457A-BB2C-B8BA638086F1/Shift/p23&gt; ; data: {\n    date = \"2012-12-02 05:00:00 +0000\";\n    endTime = \"2012-11-02 19:35:38 +0000\";\n    isTimeOff = 0;\n    isWorkday = 1;\n    shiftRotation = \"0x8260dc0 &lt;x-coredata://7CE834F9-5056-457A-BB2C-B8BA638086F1/ShiftRotation/p11&gt;\";\n    splitEndTime = nil;\n    splitStartTime = nil;\n    startTime = \"2012-11-02 09:35:34 +0000\";\n    symbol = none;\n    title = Days;\n    typeID = \"991ACC8C-ECE0-4555-9002-7AC233F26CBF\";\n}),\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you notice, the \"<strong>date</strong>\" changed to 2012-12-02, just by saving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was finally able to track the cause of the unexplained change. It seems that I was inadvertently changing the \"date\" property after I was saving the context somewhere else in my code. Perhaps that would have not happened if I had followed carmin's convention (I would have given +1 if I had the reputation). The value was not changing in the Persistent store after all.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sharing how I tracked down this bug might benefit anyone else that might have similar problems, not necessarily related to Core Data. </p>\n\n<p>I used Key Value Observing, to observe the \"date\" property. I began observing immediately after creating the \"Shift\" entity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity addObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and stopped observing after a point in my code where the change had already occurred:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then implemented the KVO method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Object being observed: %@\", [object description]);\n    NSLog(@\"Value changed to: %@\", change[NSKeyValueChangeNewKey]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed a break point at the above method. When the change occurred, it stopped at this point, and told me what had change. Most importantly, when the code stopped executing, I looked at the call stack, and traced my way back through the path that the code took that caused the change. I was able to find exactly where my code was making the change.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have much knowledge using KVO but this experience showed me its usefulness even for debugging purposes.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","ipad","cocoa"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":1,"question_id":13213177,"title":"4 Storyboards for IPhone4-IPhone5 and IPad-IPadMini?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12696242/how-to-switch-to-different-storyboard-for-iphone-5\">How to switch to different Storyboard for iPhone 5?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealing with dimensions on XCode is a nightmare, I was wondering if I can create one storyboard for different IPhone/IPad devices instead of trying to figure out in the code</p>\n"},{"tags":["cocoa"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13213397,"title":"Resources for Cocoa programming Frameworks/libraries/UI","body":"<p>I'm starting to teach myself some Cocoa programming, and i would like to know if there is any good ressource for common UI Styles.

I am doing my own reading an interleaving and not using AVAssetReader. My reader ensures that exactly one frame's worth of video data and one frame's worth of audio data are presented in a serial fashion. The problem I am having is if I don't set the expectsMediaDataInRealTime property to <strong>YES</strong>, the video asset writer will always return <strong>NO</strong> for isReadyForMoreMediaData after exactly 30 frames. If I stop writing before 30 frames, it works fine and the output file is valid. However, if I set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to YES, it works perfectly for the entire duration, which can be several thousand frames. After starting a transcode operation with expectsMediaDataInRealTime set to YES, I watched the app's memory usage over the course of compressing a very long video and there wasn't any unreasonable memory usage nor any memory leaks. And the resulting MOV file did appear to be written fairly normal, e.g. the audio data was interleaved with the video data as one would expect.</p>\n\n<p>So, why would I ever set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to NO if there is no apparent downside to setting it to YES? Does this only apply when using an Apple API to read data (using AVAssetReader)? The documentation says that this property controls writing \"media data in an ideal interleaving pattern for efficiency in storage and playback,\" but when expectsMediaDataInRealTime is set to YES, isReadyForMoreMediaData never returns NO and the file appears to be written perfectly. So, if the AVAssetWriter can do this when this property set to YES, why can't it do it when set to NO? The source is exactly the same.</p>\n\n<p>What, exactly, does this property do other than \"ensure that the value of readyForMoreMediaData is calculated appropriately\" (which means absolutely nothing to me)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","multithreading","cocoa","memory-management","grand-central-dispatch"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1595,"score":4,"question_id":4983729,"title":"Multithreading and autorelease pool","body":"<p>As I'm mastering my skills with multithreading with GCD, I've come across some question.

The main method gets called to perform the operation when the\n  NSOperationQueue schedules it to run. NSOperation classes written in\n  this way are known as non-concurrent operations, because the developer\n  is not responsible for spawning threads—multi-threading is all handled\n  by the super class. <strong>(Don’t be confused by the terminology: just\n  because an operation is non-concurrent, does not mean it cannot be\n  executed concurrently, it simply means that you don't have to handle\n  the concurrency yourself.)</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If you need more control over threading and the run-time environment\n  of your operations, you can make use of concurrent operations. To do\n  this, you subclass NSOperation and override the start method. In the\n  start method, you can spawn threads and setup the environment before\n  calling the main method. You are also required to maintain the state\n  of the NSOperation by setting properties like isExecuting and\n  isFinished. In short, concurrent operations give you a lot more\n  control, but also demand more effort—for most tasks non-concurrent\n  operations suffice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","osx","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":90,"score":2,"question_id":12991323,"title":"Cocoa code for launching an app with parameters","body":"<p>I want a Cocoa equivalent of the command line tool <code>open(1)</code>, especially for the usage in this form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>open -a &lt;SomeApplication&gt; &lt;SomeFile&gt; --args &lt;Arg1&gt; &lt;Arg2&gt; ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Take QuickTime as an example.

Interestingly, if I substitute a completely different, simpler 1024x1024 image with a much smaller file size (~300K instead of ~1MB), the icon again works fine on 10.5.

But if the object is after the first 20 rows and the table is scrolled down, a \"CoreData could not fulfill a fault\" error is raised. I have tried resaving the context and reperforming the frc fetch - all to no avail. Note: In this scenario, the frc delegate method \"didChangeObject....\" is not called for the delete - I assume this is because the object in question had not been faulted at that time (as it is was outside the initial fetch range). But for some reason, the context still thinks the object is around, although is has been deleted from the store.</p>\n\n<p>Issue 3 - Deleting sections : When the deletion of a row leads to the deletion of a section, I have gotten the \"invalid number of rows in section???\" error. I have worked around this by removing the \"reloadSection\" line from the NSFetchedResultsChangeMove: section and replacing it with \"[tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths....\" This seems to work, but once again, I am not sure if this is the best solution.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The docs say that a timer is stopped by [timer invalidate];</p>\n\n<p>I have a timer object declared as such</p>\n\n<pre><code>.h\nNSTimer *incrementTimer;\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSTimer *incrementTimer;\n.m\n@synthesize incrementTimer;\n-(void)dealloc {\n [incrementTimer release];\n [super dealloc];\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-The usual.</p>\n\n<p>When it's needed, my method does the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)setGenCount {\n    if(!condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2) {\n        incrementTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: 2.0 \n                                                      target: self \n                                                    selector:@selector(incrementBatteryVoltage:) \n                                                    userInfo: nil \n                                                     repeats: YES]; \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything above works fine.  However, once that timer does it's job, I want it to invalidate itself. I invalidate the timer because there is an equal decrement method that could be called and would fight against the incrementTimer if it was still active. (Previously, I noticed that my two timers, if active, were acting on the same ivar by increasing &amp; decreasing the value (a sort of fight)... without crashing)  The selector called works as follows:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)incrementBatteryVoltage:(NSTimer *)timer {\n    if(battVoltage &lt; 24.0) {\n         generatorDisplay.battVoltage += 0.1;\n      }\n    if(battery1Voltage == 24.0) {\n         [timer invalidate];\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have an equal method that Decrements the battery count. (previously mentioned)<br>\nDue to my program design: the interface simulates a voltage display.  When the \"machine\" is turned off, I want all the timers invalidated, regardless of what any voltage value is.  I'm doing this by checking to see if the timer is valid.</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)deEnergizeDisplays {\n\n   if([decrementTimer isValid]) {\n        [decrementTimer invalidate];\n        decrementTimer = nil;\n     }\n\n    if([incrementTimer isValid]) {\n       [incrementTimer invalidate];\n       incrementTimer = nil;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm getting numerous \"BAD_ACCESS\" crashes. The erroneous line call is always pointing toward my [timer isValid] call.  It seems that if the timer is invalidated... the pointer \ndoesn't exist either.  I know that the [timer invalidate] message disables the timer and then it is removed from the run loop and then it is released. And my understanding is: it is an autoreleased object per it's naming covention.</p>\n\n<p>My thought are: If I'm sending a retain message, shouldn't the reference still exist?  I've tried several combinations, taking away:</p>\n\n<pre><code>timer = nil;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or even instead of: </p>\n\n<pre><code>if([timer isValid])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried :</p>\n\n<pre><code>if([timer != nil])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and: </p>\n\n<pre><code>if(timer)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I always get the same crash.

Here is the code snippet that worked for me (assuming you've set up your managed object context etc):</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSError *error = nil;\nNSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];\nNSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@\"EntityA\" inManagedObjectContext:context];   \n[fetchRequest setEntity:entity];\nNSPredicate *predicateTemplate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"(0 != SUBQUERY(child, $a, (0 != SUBQUERY($a.child, $child, $child.tag == %@).@count)).@count)\", @\"YES\"]; \n[fetchRequest setPredicate:predicateTemplate];\nNSArray *test = [context executeFetchRequest:fetchRequest error:&amp;error];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Breaking the all important NSPredicate string onto several lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(0 != SUBQUERY(child, \n               $a, \n               (0 != SUBQUERY($a.child,\n                              $child, \n                              $child.tag == %@).@count)\n               ).@count\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The important part is we are selecting the <code>EntityA</code> to work from and then in the nested subquery working through the <code>child</code> relationships of the entities. I expect this can be repeated for several depths.  Not the most intuitive thing to put together... but it works.

It seemed silly to me to copy all of the objects to an array when it's possible to bind a NSCollectionView directly to Core Data. I changed my ArrayController to Entity mode and setup the Managed Object Context to point to my App Delegate's managedObjectContext. When I launch my application, there is a delay before the Window displays on screen. In fact, the other things I'm doing in windowDidLoad process immediately, but it takes another 5-10 seconds for the window to display. Once it does, nothing is showing in the NSCollectionView. </p>\n\n<p>I initially thought it just was not working until I accidentally resized the Window and all of the items showed up in the collection view.

I tried keeping all 3 as subclasses of NSObject and applying initWithNibName to an NSWindowController class WindowController variable but when I tried outputting some values on each window it wouldn't work, and also the window resulted as null using NSLog. I was wondering what was the best way to manage multiple windows, perhaps all from a same class like an AppWindowsController involving as least as possible specific code in the other classes, and keeping, if possible, the other classes as subclasses of NSObject and not NSWindowController. So if there is, maybe a way to control the behavior of the windows remotely, adding as least as possible code inside the specific classes, just to keep them as clear as possible and uniquely focused on their content.

Most of these are non-interactive, so I launch them with some command-line arguments, they do their thing, output something and quit. One of the programs is interactive, so it outputs some text and a prompt to stdout and then expects input on stdin and this keeps going until you send it a quit command.</p>\n\n<h2>What works</h2>\n\n<p>The non-interactive programs, which just dump a load of data to stdout and then terminate, are comparatively trivial:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create <code>NSPipe</code>s for stdout/stdin/stderr</li>\n<li>Launch <code>NSTask</code> with those pipes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, either</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>get the <code>NSFileHandle</code> for the other end of the pipe to read all data until the end of the stream and process it in one go when the task ends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get the <code>-fileDescriptor</code>s from the <code>NSFileHandle</code> of the other end of the output pipes.</li>\n<li>Set the file descriptor to use non-blocking mode</li>\n<li>Create a GCD dispatch source with each of those file descriptors using <code>dispatch_source_create(DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_READ, ...</code></li>\n<li>Resume the dispatch source and handle the data it throws at you using <code>read()</code></li>\n<li>Keep going until the task ends and the pipe file descriptor reports EOF (<code>read()</code> reports 0 bytes read)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What doesn't work</h2>\n\n<p>Either approach completely breaks down for interactive tools. Obviously I can't wait until the program exits because it's sitting at a command prompt and never will exit unless I tell it to. On the other hand, <code>NSPipe</code> buffers the data, so you receive it in buffer-sized chunks, unless the CLI program happens to flush the pipe explicitly, which the one in my case does not. The initial command prompt is much smaller than the buffer size, so I don't receive anything, and it just sits there. So <code>NSPipe</code> is also a no-go.</p>\n\n<p>After <a href=\"http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/186092-nstask-troubles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">some research</a>, I determined that I needed to use a <strong>pseudo-terminal</strong> (pty) in place of the NSPipe. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble getting it working.</p>\n\n<h2>What I've tried</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of the stdout pipe, I create a pty like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct termios termp;\nbzero(&amp;termp, sizeof(termp));\nint res = openpty(&amp;masterFD, &amp;slaveFD, NULL, &amp;termp, NULL);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This gives me two file descriptors; I hand the <code>slaveFD</code> over to an <code>NSFileHandle</code>, which gets passed to the <code>NSTask</code> for either just stdout or both stdout and stdin. Then I try to do the usual asynchronous reading from the master side.</p>\n\n<p>If I run the program I'm controlling in a Terminal window, it starts off by outputting 2 lines of text, one 18 bytes long including the newline, one 22 bytes and with no newline for the command prompt. After those 40 bytes it waits for input.</p>\n\n<p>If I just use the pty for stdout, I receive 18 bytes of output (exactly one line, ending in newline) from the controlled program, and no more. Everything just sits there after the initial 18 bytes, no more events - the GCD event source's handler doesn't get called.</p>\n\n<p>If I also use the pty for stdin, I usually receive 19 bytes of output (the aforementioned line plus one character from the next line) and then the controlled program dies immediately. If I wait a little before attempting to read the data (or scheduling noise causes a small pause), I actually get the whole 40 bytes before the program again dies instantly.</p>\n\n<h3>An additional dead end</h3>\n\n<p>At one point I was wondering if my async reading code was flawed, so I re-did everything using <code>NSFileHandle</code>s and its <code>-readInBackgroundAndNotify</code> method. This behaved the same as when using GCD. (I originally picked GCD over the <code>NSFileHandle</code> API as there doesn't appear to be any async writing support in <code>NSFileHandle</code>)</p>\n\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n\n<p>Having arrived at this point after well over a day of futile attempts, I could do with some kind of help. Is there some fundamental problem with what I'm trying to do? Why does hooking up stdin to the pty terminate the program? I'm not closing the master end of the pty, so it shouldn't be receiving EOF. Leaving aside stdin, why am I only getting one line's worth of output? Is there a problem with the way I'm performing I/O on the pty's file descriptor? Am I using the master and slave ends correctly - master in the controlling process, slave in the NSTask?</p>\n\n<h3>What I haven't tried</h3>\n\n<p>I so far have only performed non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O on pipes and ptys. The only thing I can think of is that the pty simply doesn't support that. (if so, why does <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);</code> succeed though?) I can try doing blocking I/O on background threads instead and send messages to the main thread. I was hoping to avoid having to deal with multithreading, but considering how broken all these APIs seem to be, it can't be any more time consuming than trying yet another permutation of async I/O. Still, I'd love to know what exactly I'm doing wrong.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","facebook","cocoa"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":712,"score":4,"question_id":12526142,"title":"Access Facebook Accounts on OS X Mountain Lion","body":"<p>As Mountain Lion now officialy has Facebook integrated I wanted to play a little bit with <code>Accounts.framework</code> and <code>Social.framework</code> of OS X.</p>\n\n<p>I set up an App in the Facebook Developer App and used the following code to request access to the Facebook Accounts of the logged in user:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ACAccountStore *acStore = [[ACAccountStore alloc] init];\nACAccountType *accType = [acStore accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifier:ACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook];\n\nNSDictionary *options = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:FB_APP_ID, ACFacebookAppIdKey, @\"read_stream, publish_stream\", ACFacebookPermissionsKey, ACFacebookAudienceFriends, ACFacebookAudienceKey, nil];\n\n\n[acStore requestAccessToAccountsWithType:accType options:options completion:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {\n    if (granted) {\n        NSLog(@\"Accounts: %@\", acStore.accounts);\n        NSLog(@\"Access granted\");\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Access denied\");\n    }\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I always get the error <code>Error Domain=XPCObjectsErrorDomain Code=2 \"The operation couldn’t be completed.

I need to detect a key down AND a key release or key up whenever a keyboard key is pressed. This is fairly straight-forward when intercepting the application's event handling chain with <code>[ NSEvent addLocalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask: handler: ]</code>. That lets you intercept and modify <code>NSEvent</code>s for a variety of event types, including <code>NSKeyUp</code> and <code>NSKeyDown</code> for the regular printing keys, as well as <code>NSFlagsChanged</code> which can be used to detect the shift, ctrl, alt, and cmd keys. In fact, because the modifier flags change on both the key up and key down for shift, ctrl, alt, and cmd keys, <code>NSFlagsChanged</code> can be used as a key up and key down event for those keys by checking the <code>[NSEvent modifierFlags]</code> along with the <code>[NSEvent keyCode]</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Capslock is different, though. Because the capslock modifier really only acts on a key down, when you press capslock you only get a <code>NSFlagsChanged</code> with capslock is pressed, not when it's released. And <code>NSKeyUp</code> and <code>NSKeyDown</code> aren't emitted with modifier keys like capslock and shift and ctrl, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone suggest a way, maybe even a lower-level interface, for getting capslock key up events?

There's a feature that OSX has that I didn't even know existed - the 'Help' key. My MBP doesn't have one, and neither does my Apple wired keyboard purchased a year ago. It seems that this is mostly something that older Macs have. Apparently it generates the same scan code as the Insert key on PC keyboards.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, when the Help key is pressed, the cursor over our application (or any application that receives the Help key event) turns into a little question mark. This seems to be part of what's called 'context-sensitive help mode', as documented in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSHelpManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSHelpManager/setContextHelpModeActive%3a\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSHelpManager's setContextHelpModeActive: method</a> and in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSApplication/activateContextHelpMode%3a\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSApplication's activateContextHelpMode: method</a> docs. From the docs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this mode, the cursor becomes a question mark, and help appears for any user interface item the user clicks.</p>\n  \n  <p>Most applications don’t use this method. Instead, applications enter\n  context-sensitive mode when the user presses the Help key.\n  Applications exit context-sensitive help mode upon the first event\n  after a help window is displayed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How many Cocoa developers actually know about this? I'm assuming that clicking on something in the application with this question mark cursor should do something like bring up a help message, but I haven't found a single Cocoa application where it actually does anything at all - not even Apple's apps do anything. In fact, it even seems to put a lot of applications into a strange mode where the cursor text selection is enabled. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that when we change the application cursor programmatically in Qt when we're in this help-question-cursor-mode, bad things happen. Specifically, our application actually crashes. The crash happens deep inside Cocoa in the NSApplication's NSHelpManager. I'd like to find out why we're seeing this crash, but I'm actually more interested in how we can suppress this 'help' mode. There's nothing in Qt or Cocoa that I can see that would stop it, other than perhaps intercepting and squashing an event, which I haven't tried yet. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know any more about this?</p>\n"}]}

This should (to my understanding) all be ok since the test bundle is linked against the framework and will load it just like any other bundle.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT | I think I'm nearly there.

So now my framework has its installation directory set to <code>@rpath</code> and the Test target has its runtime search paths (rpath) defined as the build directory. This saves me having to copy the framework into the test bundle and means that overall the resulting framework is much more flexible in nature since it can live anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I also realize that I <em>should</em> have set the Bundle Loader on the Test target, so this is now set to the path of the framework binary.</p>\n\n<p>I can build the test target and I can #import classes from the framework, error free.

For example, the user might write <code>killall \"TextEdit\"</code> or <code>say \"Hello world!\"</code> in a text field, and I want to execute that command.</p>\n\n<p>NSTask is the way to go, except I have two problems with it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>First:</strong> the arguments. Right now I'm doing this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSArray* args = [commandString componentsSeparatedByString: @\" \"];\n[task setArguments: [args subarrayWithRange: NSMakeRange(1, [args count] - 1)]]; // First one is the command name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this the way to do it? I don't think I've had problems with this yet, but I doesn't look like it's safe. Imagine this: the user writes <code>killall 'Address Book'</code> but the command receives as arguments <code>'Address</code> and <code>Book'</code>?? That doesn't work. So, what should I do instead? How can I safely parse the arguments?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second:</strong> the launch path. It's much more user-friendly to only have to write the name of the command, instead of the complete path to it. So I want to support that, which means finding out programmatically the full path for a command having only it's name. For that I wrote a category on NSTask like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+ (NSString*)completePathForExec: (NSString*)exec\n{\n    NSTask* task = [[NSTask alloc] init];\n    NSPipe* pipe = [[NSPipe alloc] init];\n\n    NSArray* args = [NSArray arrayWithObject: exec];\n    [task setLaunchPath: @\"/usr/bin/which\"];\n    [task setArguments: args];\n    [task setStandardOutput: pipe];\n    [task setStandardError: pipe];\n\n    [task launch];    \n    [task waitUntilExit];\n\n    NSFileHandle* file = [pipe fileHandleForReading];\n    NSString* result = [[NSString alloc] initWithData: [file readDataToEndOfFile] encoding: NSASCIIStringEncoding];\n\n    if ([result length]) {\n        if ([result hasSuffix: @\"\\n\"]) { result = [result substringWithRange: NSMakeRange(0, [result length] - 1)]; }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n    else { return exec; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seems to works well. However, how can I be sure that this path: <code>/usr/bin/which</code> will always work? I mean: will it work on 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, etc? I think I had a problem once where the path to a shell command changed with the system version, and you can never be too careful. </p>\n\n<p>If the path is guaranteed to stay the same, then this isn't a problem. If it changes, then how can I know the 'path to the path-finder'?</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","cocoa","accessibility"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12390825,"title":"Why does it return null when call AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue to get the NSAccessiblityValueAttribute sometimes?","body":"<p>I am using cocoa and calling AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue to get the NSAccessiblityValueAttribute of an AXTextField in another (Carbon) process.

I set up the array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>database = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and my custom object, called \"recordObject\" contains the following variables and inits:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSString *name;\nint       anInt;\nBool      aBool;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also synthesized methods so I can make calls like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aString = [[database objectAtIndex:someIndex] name];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And added methods to my controller class to add, remove, and select the individual records for display.  So far everything works correctly and exactly as expected.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I've set up my recordObject class (subclass of NSObject) to use the NSCoder (by including  in the @interface directive, and have added the following custom encoder and decoder methods in the implementation file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void) encodeWithCoder: (NSCoder *) encoder {\n    [encoder encodeObject: name  forKey: @\"recordName\"];\n    [encoder encodeInt:    anInt forKey: @\"recordInteger\"];\n    [encoder encodeBool:   aBool forKey: @\"recordBool\"];\n}\n\n-(id) initWithCoder: (NSCoder *) decoder {\n    name    = [decoder decodeObjectForKey: @\"recordName\"];\n    anInt   = [decoder decodeIntForKey:    @\"recordInteger\"];\n    aBool   = [decoder decodeBoolForKey:   @\"recordBool\"];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In order to write the file, I have used the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[NSKeyedArchiver archiveRootObject:database toFile:myPath];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run the program, everything APPEARS to work correctly.  The encoder method is called for each of the records in the array and the file is written to disk.  Opening the file with TextEdit shows that the data is there (though mostly unintelligible to me.)</p>\n\n<p>THE PROBLEM:</p>\n\n<p>Here's where I run into a snag.</p>\n\n<p>I added the following code to LOAD the file into my database array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>database = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFile:myPath];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run the program again, this time Loading the database, it APPEARS to work correctly.  My first test was to use the NSMutableArray count method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = [database count];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result was that X is filled with the correct number of records in the file.  If there were 5 records when I saved the database, X is set to 5 after loading the database on the next execution of the program.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here's the big problem:</p>\n\n<p>The program crashes if I try to use ANY of my accessor methods.  For example, if I try to use the following after loading the database:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aString = [[database objectAtIndex:someIndex] name];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the program crashes and returns the following error in the console:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Program received signal:  “EXC_BAD_ACCESS”.\nsharedlibrary apply-load-rules all\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My interpretation is that the data is not being loaded and initialized into the database array correctly for some reason, but for the life of me I can't figure out where I've gone wrong here.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, everything I've implemented came from Stephen G.

The NSTableView's content is provided via bindings to an NSArrayController that is bound to a CoreData ManagedObjectContext. New lines to the NSTableView are just added at and never removed or reordered. </p>\n\n<p>I'd like to keep the NSTableView (or respectively the NSScrollView) pinned down to the bottom, so that new lines that were added to the table become visible immediately. Additionally, this shall just happen, when the NSTableView is scrolled to the bottom and not when the user scrolled upwards to review other rows. </p>\n\n<p>I'm currently using the following code </p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView didAddRowView:(NSTableRowView *)rowView forRow:(NSInteger)row {\n    NSInteger numberOfRows = [tableView numberOfRows];\n    NSLog(@\"row: %lu, %lu numberOfRows \", row, numberOfRows);\n    if (row == numberOfRows-1) {\n        [tableView scrollRowToVisible:numberOfRows - 1];\n    }\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works so far, but just when the window is active. When the window is inactive, the didAddRowView method doesn't get called until the window becomes active again. Thus the NSTableView does not scroll down immediately. As the NSTableView also gets filled via CoreData bindings I don't know any point where I could just manually trigger the scrolling once a new item has been inserted. Additionally, the didAddRowView delegate method gets called quite often (e.g. when scrolling the table manually) and there is only really the need to scroll down once a new item has been inserted making the solution even less elegant. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any point where I could hook into the insertion process or the NSScrollView directly to scroll down to the bottom when the application is active and inactive just when a new row is added to the NSTableView?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> \nFor the sake of completion or in case the solution of @rdelmar does not work for you, I've subclassed the NSTableView in question and implemented this in the reloadData method </p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void) reloadData {\n    [super reloadData];\n    NSInteger numberOfRows = [self numberOfRows];\n    NSRange rowsInRect = [self rowsInRect:self.superview.bounds];\n    NSInteger lastVisibleRow = rowsInRect.location + rowsInRect.length;\n\n    if (lastVisibleRow == numberOfRows-1) {\n        [self scrollRowToVisible:numberOfRows - 1];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reloadData method gets called once the new item is received in the ArrayController and shall be added to the table.

The reason they didn't seems to be that the implementation files (<code>.m</code>) of the classes under test had not been added to the unit test target.

If I put this command </p>\n\n<pre><code>NSLog(@\"%@\",[self exposedBindings]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in any method inside my subclass of NSTextView, I get an array with all the available bindings, including \"value\". It seems like the bindings get lost at some point or I cannot access them from my appControler. </p>\n\n<p>How is this possible? Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","cocoa","webview","interface-builder"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12216593,"title":"Cocoa resizing WebView","body":"<p>still new to Mac programming, having an issue with WebViews</p>\n\n<p>My view controller declares two Outlets</p>\n\n<pre><code>@property IBOutlet NSView *mainView;\n@property IBOutlet WebView *webView;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are synthesised and linked up to an NSView and a WebView respectivally.
