How to tell php to allow adding more than one value in array via html form?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>I want to import more values in one input field, that would be separated with \",\" for example, or whatever convention is.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;?php\n $unos=array();\n $unos[]=$_POST['unos'];\n $rezultat=count($unos); /*number of n's*/\n $zbir=array_sum($unos); /*total sum of n's*/\n $av=$zbir/$rezultat;    /*average value of n's*/\n echo \"average value is $av&lt;/br&gt;\";\n }\n ?&gt;\n &lt;form action=\"?\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n &lt;input type=\"number\" name=\"unos\"  id=\"unos\"&gt;\n &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"&gt;\n &lt;/form&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code calculate average value of n's. I am beginner and just want to know how to add values of arrays by user via html.The reason I wanted to know how one can do that in 1 input file is because I do not want to limit number of values with number of input fields. I want make that user can add values as many as he want.

I've got some results from a database query that I'm trying to merge and then sort alphabetically. I installed the intl extension on my php ini and defined a new Collator. The function collator_asort works already, but it doesn't sort the records properly yet. I've read the posts about this same problem <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120334/how-to-sort-an-array-of-utf-8-strings\">in this site</a>, and also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832709/natural-sorting-algorithm-in-php-with-support-for-unicode\">here (still in this site)</a>. I'm doing this on Windows x64 machine, so I think that should be a problem, according to the first post. However, some answers point that the encoding of the string passed to setlocale should be in utf8, and also that the character code should be appropiate to the OS.\nI'm currently using <code>$colar=setlocale(LC_COLLATE, 'esm');\n$COLAR=setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'esm');</code> which is how spanish for Mexico is defined in the Microsoft site <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/39cwe7zf%28v=vs.90%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\nAnd the code to sort the array is like so: <code>$consulta_gral=array_merge($consulta_1, $consulta_2, $consulta_3);\nforeach($consulta_gral as $consulta_todos){\ncollator_asort($coll, $consulta_gral, SORT_STRING); \n};</code></p>\n\n<p>I wonder if someone can point out where should I find the appropiate character code for windows, specially as I'm looking for a simple solution which I think may be the configuration of the collator. I realize this may be a hard issue, but as some answers on the second post I mention, the solution should be in the intl extension of php. ¡At least I hope so!

MySQL / PHP","body":"<p>total n00b here, first post, so please be constructive! I've bought a book to teach myself PHP / MySQL - and not one which is universally praised, unfortunately - so my progress is a bit erratic. </p>\n\n<p>I have two tables which I want to link. I want to display all of the information held in table 1 (let's call it Records), but ONLY once. I then want to check whether each item in Records has a match to a specific field in table 2 (UserTable) and if it does, display a ticked checkbox, or an empty checkbox if there's no match.</p>\n\n<p>The issues I've had to date are only displaying the items from Records where there's a match, or displaying multiple instances of each item in Records where there are multiple matches. I've solved these with the code below - but I keep thinking there must be a better way to do this, perhaps with a single link?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here are some excerpts from the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Records\";\n$res = mysqli_query($mysqli,$sql);\n\nwhile ($iteminfo = mysqli_fetch_array($res, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) {\n$recordid2 = $iteminfo['record_id'];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've omitted a section which pulls out the relevant data from Records and starts to build a table, then:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$sql2 = \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches FROM UserTable \nwhere usertable.item = '$recordid2' and User_ID = '$current_user_id'\";\n\n$res2 = mysqli_query($mysqli, $sql2);\n$matches = mysqli_fetch_array($res2, MYSQLI_ASSOC);\n$matches2 = $matches['matches'];\n\nif ($matches2) {\n        $output = \"&lt;input type='checkbox' name='test' checked&gt;\"; } else {\n        $output = \"&lt;input type='checkbox' name='test'&gt;\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I say, this works, but it feels a bit clumsy - I'm running a separate nested query for every item in Records, which over time could become really slow. Is there a way to run a single query for the whole which brings through all of the row info (once) and a 0 or 1 depending on whether there is a match in UserTable?

I want to be able to view that page by going to <code>example.com/this-is-a-test</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To do that, i'm guessing i'll have to do something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Route::any('(:any)', 'view@index');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And create a controller called View with an index method. All good, right?</p>\n\n<p>The problem is creating the admin area. I'm gonna have a few pages within the area, a few examples are Dashboard, Pages, Settings and Tools. Since all of those are sub-pages in the admin, i figured it would be appropriate to make them nested controllers, right?

I would prefer just calling the dashboard controller instead of redirecting to <code>/admin/dashboard</code> from the admin controller.

If i go to <code>admin/blah</code> or just <code>blabla</code> i get a 404, so i know <em>something</em> is happening, it's just not happening correctly.

Also 'config_bestellformular.php' is completely unrelated and used somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nSeems there is a problem with the method=\"post\", method=\"get\" works without error...\nI really don't want to use the get method, so any ideas here.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if I send them per get I can't echo a variable out. I don't see a error in the 'einlese.php' (for those of you who can't understand german it means 'read.php'), but here is the code nonetheless:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $company = $_GET['company'];\n\n    echo $company;\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nSo the big problem was the name tag with [].

I have to create a complex page with many forms, and can not go further with this problem.. \nI'd like to get a solution for this problem, or just little understanding about Zend Form's behavior about these multiple form submissions. </p>\n\n<p>(There are many pages about these issues, but most of them just consider about placing multiple forms in same page, and no much more..)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance..</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mongodb","mongodb-php"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":3,"question_id":13274910,"title":"PHP+MongoDB: Uncaught exception 'MongoCursorException' with message 'No such file or directory'","body":"<p>I'm working on a web application which is trying to connect to a MongoDB database from PHP.\nIn the 90% of page loads everything works fine, but in the other 10% it throws the following exception when I try to update a collection:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'MongoCursorException' with message 'No such file or directory' in D:\\webDev\\webSites\\str\\dev3_global_classes\\User.php:40 Stack trace: #0 D:\\webDev\\webSites\\str\\dev3_global_classes\\User.php(40): MongoCollection->update(Array, Array, Array) #1 D:\\webDev\\webSites\\str\\dev3_init_init.php(8): User->__construct(NULL) #2 D:\\webDev\\webSites\\str\\dev3\\index.php(3): include('D:\\webDev\\webSi...') #3 {main} thrown in D:\\webDev\\webSites\\str\\dev3_global_classes\\User.php on line 40</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PHP code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function __construct($SESSIONID = null) {        \n    User::$_users_collection = Main::$_mongo-&gt;selectCollection(\"users\");\n\n     ...   \n\n    $query = array('session_id' =&gt; session_id());\n\n    $expiry = time() + Main::$_lifetime;\n    $data = array(\n        'session_id' =&gt; session_id(),\n        'expiry' =&gt; (string)$expiry,\n        'ip' =&gt; $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']\n    );\n\n    $options = array(\n        'upsert' =&gt; true,\n        'safe' =&gt; true\n    );\n\n    try {\n        User::$_users_collection-&gt;update($query, array('$set' =&gt; $data), $options);\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        throw $e;\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Mongo version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Wed Oct 17 10:53:48 /usr/bin/mongos db version v2.0.7, pdfile version 4.5 starting (--help for usage)\nWed Oct 17 10:53:48 git version: 875033920e8869d284f32119413543fa475227bf\nWed Oct 17 10:53:48 build info: Linux ip-10-2-29-40 2.6.21.7-2.ec2.v1.2.fc8xen #1 SMP Fri Nov 20 17:48:28 EST 2009 x86_64 BOOST_LIB_VERSION=1_41\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My mongo cluster has only one shard, my php version is: 5.4.4, and my mongo driver version is: 1.2.12.</p>\n\n<p>I thank you in advance for your reply.</p>\n\n<p>--\nNorbert</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","jquery","html","sql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13274593,"title":"PHP, Jquery and DOM manipulation","body":"<p>I have a list that's being populated from the database it's sorted using the time field by ASC dates.

I am not allowed to be copy/pasting our code anywhere, so I will do my best to describe our setup. </p>\n\n<p>We currently have been using the <strong>Object Pooling Pattern</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We have the <code>Main Class</code> file which pools all the necessary subclasses we will need to use later.</p>\n\n<p>We then setup the <code>Main Class</code> file to have a method, which handles developer requests made from anywhere in the website. For example, we have a <code>Sub Class</code> file that generates HTML for us, saving us time in areas that would require rewriting the same HTML code again.</p>\n\n<p>We also have created a wrapper function called <code>run()</code>. We use this wrapper function for interacting anywhere in the website. <code>run()</code>, will make a request to the <code>Main Class</code> and ask for access to <code>Sub Class</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Main Class</code> will determine whether or not that <code>Sub Class</code> file, and <code>Sub Class</code> method exists and is callable. If everything succeeds, the request made from anywhere in the website is then sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> from the <code>Main Class</code>. <em>Keeping in mind of course that the original request was sent to the <code>run()</code> method, and was then validated by the <code>Main Class</code>, before the request was actually sent to the <code>Sub Class</code> AND... has already been instantiated by the <code>Main Class</code>.</em></p>\n\n<p>However, as we amend our code, this setup has seemingly drifted beyond our control.

Separating the website admin back end from the member front end.</p>\n\n<p>Would it be suitable to have two wrapper functions to be used anywhere in the website? One for accessing anything on the front end, and another for accessing anything on the back end?</p>\n\n<p>We are in dire need of a better setup.

Part of my process is verify that image paths don't point to non-existant images (i.e. there are no broken images).

The cart should loop all these criterias and instantly list the items in the cart, computes the total with discounts and tax. Can someone help me with this code to make it be able to calculate the pricing correctly depending on what is priced by weight or quantity and displays it in the cart also.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I was trying to use an if statement in the for loop. Then I calculate the price and store it in a table and then fetch the value from the table and display in the cart. But the displayed value is not up to date and the calculations are mixed up sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<p><pre></p>\n\n<code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I've tried searching for this and there are many similar posts, but I can't seem to find anything exactly like my problem and I have been at this for hours! :-/</p>\n\n<p>I'm building a system in PHP (5.3) and MySQL and part of the functionality is that a user is required to upload some files based on some previous selections.

This all works for me and I can save the 2 files to the server and then insert 2 records to a table in the database with the file name, file type (pdf, jpg) and user id etc by looping through \"$_FILES\" in my Upload class.</p>\n\n<p>What I am trying to do however is somehow add the name attribute <code>&lt;input name=\"foo\"&gt;</code> to the inserted row so that \"File 1\" would have \"file1\" in a column called document_type and \"File 2\" would have \"file2\". That way I can do a basic check in MySQL to see if the user has uploaded the appropriate files.</p>\n\n<p>To cut to the chase, is there a way to assign or associate the INPUT \"name\" attribute to each file in $_FILES in my Upload class so that when when I loop through $_FILES, there is a unique document_type? </p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you require further information regarding my setup.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","cookies","affiliate"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":1,"question_id":13270499,"title":"Is there a way to check if a website places cookies based on there URL?","body":"<p>Is there a way to check if a website places cookies based on their URL?

Currently one of the sites we work on is on Enterprise and utilizes FPC of course. The problem is, we have an inventory update that runs every 15 minutes. A lot of orders are placed to CSR's over the phone and through a catalog into an external system outside of Magento.</p>\n\n<p>Every 15 minutes a script is ran to check any inventory in that system and to see if it differs then what is in Magento. If there is a difference then the inventory is updated in Magento. Using all Magento methods, no sql or anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>We have always had caching issues and have tried all of the latest techniques when they come out. The latest one we are trying is Redis, and we have had good success on other sites with it. However, we are still seeing crazy load on the server and it is apparent that pages aren't cached. </p>\n\n<p>After digging into the code it appears that after ever every model save or admin product controller save it looks to see if cache needs to be invalidated. It appears that changing any attribute, well at least inventory will mark FPC as needing to be invalidated.</p>\n\n<p>I am confused about what invalidation means, because a while back we had a question out to customer support about something similar and this was the response</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Full Page cache will get to\n  invalidated state upon any changes on the products, categories, CMS\n  even when the stock is decreased after a sale.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now when full page cache gets to invalidated state this does not mean\n  that something is changed on your frontend however any changes applied\n  after the last refresh will not be shown on the frontend.</p>\n  \n  <p>However if having the FPC validated at all times is a must for your\n  business logic you could certainly set your Magento Installation to\n  refresh it automatically through cron functionality as often as you\n  desire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However on all of the tests that I have done, on both 1.9 and 1.11 Enterprise, it appears when FPC is invalidated, the response isn't being pulled in from cache. Which is contradictory to what they have said about it just not having the newer updates. </p>\n\n<p>Is there something I am missing? Does anyone have a good explanation for how the invalidation works in Magento specifically for FPC or any good links to fully understand the process and the code?</p>\n\n<p>You can try this yourself for any page that is full page cached. But it is my understanding that the method <code>processRequest</code> in <code>/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Cache.php</code> should set the body content with the cached response and return true if the page is cached. </p>\n\n<p>To test go to any page make sure you got it cached and returning true. Go in and edit a product, in our case quantity. This will invalidate FPC. However now when you load the page that was cached before it will return false in this method and not be a cached page. I don't know if this is accurate to be able to tell if a page is cached or not but that is where my investigation lead me. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nUpon further investigation I have found that when you save a product in the admin, the controller action </p>\n\n<p><code>Mage_Adminhtml_Catalog_ProductController::saveAction()</code> </p>\n\n<p>will call the following method </p>\n\n<p><code>Mage::getModel('catalogrule/rule')-&gt;applyAllRulesToProduct($productId)</code> </p>\n\n<p>Then in the <code>Mage_CatalogRule_Model_Resource_Rule</code> class, the <code>applyAllRulesForDateRange</code> method is called and that fires off the event </p>\n\n<p><code>catalogrule_after_apply</code></p>\n\n<p>Which the Full Page Cache module is observing and firing the clean cache method for the FPC tag. Essentially deleting all FPC cache records.</p>\n\n<p>I don't see why this is necessary if previous to this the logic is clearing the FPC records that are tied to the product and category tags. Is this a bug?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","apache","joomla","hacking"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":13270555,"title":"Site is being re-hacked!

I'll get back to the last line in a sec.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the problem: <code>sys_get_temp_dir()</code> should give back the temporary directory for php, which is /tmp be default on a linux system. For security reasons, this directory should reside in the open_basedir of userA. According to the php-source of 5.3.10, the <code>sys_get_temp_dir()</code>-function uses the environment variable TMPDIR to get this directory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>     // php-src/main/php_open_temporary_file.c:217-219\n     /* On Unix use the (usual) TMPDIR environment variable. */\n     {\n             char* s = getenv(\"TMPDIR\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what the fifth line in the configuration above should do. However, <code>sys_get_temp_dir()</code> simply returns the global system directory, ignoring the environmental variable (which is perfectly set in $_SERVER, also viewable via <code>phpinfo()</code>).</p>\n\n<p>This results in some nasty bugs with various software relying on <code>sys_get_temp_dir()</code>, as that directory is outside of the <code>open_basedir</code> setting. I've tried to set the variable directly into $_ENV and $_SERVER without a change in behaviour. I've tried a <code>putenv('TMPDIR=/home/userA/www/tmp')</code> without change. </p>\n\n<p>However, I am able to change the output by defining the variable into /etc/apache2/envvars - which is useless for me, as I want each VHOST to have its own temporary folder.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I have found so far is overwriting the internal <code>sys_get_temp_dir()</code> through an extension like <a href=\"http://no2.php.net/manual/en/function.runkit-function-redefine.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">runkit</a> and enforcing its inclusion via <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file\" rel=\"nofollow\">auto_prepend_file</a>.

My code gets the graph data from a database and iterates through, calling a function for each graph that contains all the JpGraph code for setting up, styling the graph and caching it as a png file in a cache folder on the server. FPDF then places these images in the pdf, which is served to browser.</p>\n\n<p>The problem: I'm getting PHP out of memory errors when the number of graphs exceeds a certain number. AFAICT this is not an FPDF problem: in trying to diagnose the problem I have generated much larger documents with many more (pre-generated) graphs and images of equivalent size. The problem seems to be that the memory used to render the graph in the graph rendering function is not freed when the function is completed. This is based on the fact that if I call memory_get_peak_usage in the function I get a bunch of increasing numbers, one from each time the function is called, up to the limit of 64MB where it stops.</p>\n\n<p>My graph generation script looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function barChart($filename, $ydata, $xdata){\n\n// Create the graph. These two calls are always required\n$graph = new Graph(900,500);\n$graph-&gt;SetScale('textlin');\n\n//(bunch of styling stuff)\n\n// Create the bar plot\n$bplot=new BarPlot($ydata);\n\n// Add the plot to the graph\n$graph-&gt;Add($bplot);\n\n//(more styling stuff)\n\n\n// Display the graph\n$graph-&gt;Stroke($filename);\n\n$graph = null;\n$bplot = null;\n\nunset($graph);\nunset($bplot);\n\necho \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\".(memory_get_peak_usage(true)/1048576).\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, I've tried unsetting and nullifying the graph and bplot objects, although my understanding is that this shouldn't be necessary. Shouldn't all the memory used by the Graph and Bplot instances be freed up when the function finishes? Or is this perhaps a JpGraph memory leak?

Now each question has its own amount of total marks. What I want to do is that if the user enters in a number in the text input, it should do a calculation on the difference between the number entered in the text input and the number under the \"Total Marks\" column. So if you look at the example below:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Question No.   Question                 Answer     Marks per Answer    Total Marks\n 1              Here are 2 answers       B          (text input) = 2        2\n                                         D          (text input) = 1\n 2              Here is a single answer  True       (text input) = 5        0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see in the table above, the text inputs for the answers in question 1 equals 3 altogether. So 5 (from total marks for question 1) minus 3 = 2 (Total marks now equals 2)</p>\n\n<p>For question 2, the text input for the answer in question 2  equals 5, so 5 (from total marks for question 2) minus 5 = 0 (Total marks now equals 0).</p>\n\n<p><strong>MY QUESTIONS:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How and what is the best method to use in order to perform these calculations? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>2.What I also want is that if a question only contains a single answer (like question 2 in the above example only has one answer), then I want the text input to become readonly and the text input should display the same number as the total marks as that it has to equal the same marks anyway, so it would look like this below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Question No.   Question                  Answer     Marks per Answer             Total Marks\n 2              Here is a single answer  True       (text input(readonly)) = 5        0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is a jsfiddle <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/AeT6E/4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo</a> so you know what the HTML code looks like. In the jsffidle what I have done is that in the textboxes I inserted the values in them, but I left the \"Total marks\" for questions to \"5\" when really they should both make \"0\" if you calculate the difference between the total marks and the numbers entered in the text inputs. Also question 2's text input is readonly, this is because it is just a single answer to this question</p>\n\n<p>Below is the html code which is in the jsfiddle:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;table border='1' id='markstbl'&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th class='questionth'&gt;Question No.&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th class='questionth'&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th class='answerth'&gt;Answer&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th class='answermarksth'&gt;Marks per Answer&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th class='noofmarksth'&gt;Total Marks&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr class=\"questiontd\"&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"questionnumtd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"questioncontenttd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;Here are 2 Answers Question&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answertd\"&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answermarkstd\"&gt;&lt;input class=\"individualMarks\" name=\"answerMarks[]\" id=\"individualtext\" type=\"text\" value=\"3\" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"noofmarkstd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr class=\"questiontd\"&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answertd\"&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answermarkstd\"&gt;&lt;input class=\"individualMarks\" name=\"answerMarks[]\" id=\"individualtext\" type=\"text\" value=\"2\" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr class=\"questiontd\"&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"questionnumtd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"questioncontenttd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;Here is single Answer Question&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answertd\"&gt;True&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"answermarkstd\"&gt;&lt;input class=\"individualMarks\" name=\"answerMarks[]\" id=\"individualtext\" type=\"text\" value=\"5\" readonly=\"readonly\"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td class=\"noofmarkstd\" rowspan=\"2\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let me just say that there are can be numerous questions and numerous answers, please don't just provide an answer that fits for only this example.

Another approach is caching each bad email in each cache key and checking only if such key exist in cache or not, but in that case purging the cache will be more complicated. I'm thinking this is the best solution. Keys in cache can be like, bad_email_. And logic of that pre sending call could be: check if required email exist in cache, if not exist, then check in DB if it is not present and there too, then it is good email. From other point if system detect bad email then it will be saved in DB and in Cache in the same time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","yii","relational-database"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13264359,"title":"STAT Relation on a related model's STAT relation, Yii","body":"<p>I am having a problem with STAT relation in Yii.

I looked through other topics since there are some topics here involving custom session handler but no one of them answered my question. \nI use a custom session handler in a class called \"sessions\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>require_once \"mySQL.php\";\n\nclass sessions {\nprivate $db;\npublic function __construct(){\n    $this-&gt;db=new mySQL('localhost', user, pw, database);\n    session_set_save_handler(array(&amp;$this,\"open\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"close\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"read\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"write\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"destroy\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"gc\"));\n    register_shutdown_function('session_write_close');\n    session_start();\n} \npublic function read($sessionID){\n    $abfrage=\"SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE id='\".$sessionID.\"'\";\n    $result= $this-&gt;db-&gt;query($abfrage);\n    if ($result == false){\n        return '';\n    }\n    if (count($result) &gt; 0){\n        return $result[0][\"value\"];\n    }\n    else{ \n    return '';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In \"mySQL.php\" there is just a class \"mySQL\" written which creates a mysqli connection to the database. This is working and not the problem. I would like to draw the focus to the \"read\" routine because this seems to be the primary problem. If i now create a session via</p>\n\n<pre><code>require_once \"classes/sessions.php\";\n$SESSION=new sessions();\n$token=hash(\"sha256\",session_id().time());\n$_SESSION['token']=$token;\n$_SESSION['running']=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and write values into the session the right database value is created:</p>\n\n<pre><code>id (varchar 64) = 54ul84nhc3aimqc55efcs49js4\nlastUpdated (int 11) = 1352226239\nstart (int 11) = 1352226233\nvalue (varchar 20000) =     token|s:64:\"2b92aa848a86741ef11d800c3dce527fdcee264f50de10381941241c3d9cc9ee\";running|i:1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and even the garbage collector works fine but when i reload the page and try to echo </p>\n\n<pre><code>$_SESSION['running']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i get the error \"Notice:Undefined index: running\". A debugger run informed that the above posted read routine returns 1 (which would be equal to the boolean \"true\"?!) instead of the value. I checked that the \"sessionID\" in the read routine for that case was the one in the session table, so i'm basically lost. It would be very nice if you can help me, because so far i'm already impressed of the possibilities offered by such custom session handler.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it's possible to pose also a side question here. Is it right that when i reload the page the constructor of sessions is called by \"$SESSION=new sessions();\" even when there is already a session running (however this behaviour does not change the session_id)? Or is this due to my broken session read routine?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your help.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I'm using PHP/5.4.4 and MySQL 5.5.25a in a xampp distribution along with phpmyAdmin 3.5.2 to set up the database. The session table is a table of format \"MEMORY\", that's why i'm using a varchar 20000 field instead of a text field. I just saw this article <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6208156/why-does-mysql-query-return-true-with-a-select-statement\">Why does mysql_query() return TRUE with a SELECT statement?</a>\nstating that a mysql_query returns true from time to time when the server interrupts connections suddenly.

As a general statement, is it considered best practice to simply construct static queries and to execute them as needed, or simply piece together elements of a MySQL statement based on conditions? </p>\n\n<p>To narrow the question, I have a specific example:</p>\n\n<p>Say I have a few drop-down menus that define the search on the user's end. Let one drop-down simply contain a list of names, say Bob Smith, and the two others a date range. From there, I can easily create a search along the lines of <code>SELECT item FROM checkOUT WHERE...</code> I can definitely write a general query with parameters to be executed when ALL three of the parameters are present. Consider the case when only a date range is selected regardless of individuals - that would require only two parameters and a different general query. And what if the data is spread across multiple tables? That has to be taken into account. I should add as well that my function is based on drop-down menus - not original user input.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, what would be the best method to create the MySQL Query - prepared statements or dynamically created statements? Obviously, the end result will rely on a hybrid of the two, but to which side it leans the farthest is the issue. I'm asking this question as I am not too familiar with this particular side of handling multiple queries from one source. Typically, I simply have to execute one query to get what I need and work with it - not sorting.</p>\n\n<p>Any insight is appreciated.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","forms","select"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13259491,"title":"MySQL Use Array From Non Existent Column","body":"<p>I'm not sure if my title is even worded correctly.

To do this, I use what I call an ajaxBootstrap to call the appropriate function that then instantiates the objects needed for that specific Ajax script.</p>\n\n<p>To load those classes from my library I have an autoload function in my ajaxBootstrap so I don't need to use a bunch of require and include statements.  My problem is those files aren't being loaded due to a path issue with the autoload function.

But using the same path in the autoloader function throws an error.  The really odd thing is if I put an else if statement in the autoloader that loads a class from the folder where my ajaxBootstrap is it also works fine too...</p>\n\n<p>I know I could just use the require statements and be done with the problem but I want to be able to scale the project and not need to use loads of require statements in the future.

It would be like query something with rownum 1-5, 6-10 etc. but the controller would only get the pageNumber via $_GET. Would those math be made within the controller, who would only ask the model for 1-5 or would the model get the pageNumber and the math would be made within the model?
