Is there a built-in functionality for it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m working on a Flash widget (in AS3), and I would like to be able to show a movie clip in a modal fashion. Essentially, I need a simple modal window inside the wieget. So far I learned that that I need to implement the \"modalness\" by myself (in AS3). There used to be something in previous versions of Flash and there is something in Flex, but I have not experience with Flax and I’m not sure what it involves.</p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to write it myself without any deep planning upfront and soon and hit some problems. It seems that the root of the problems is that I cannot keep a focus on a movie clip (or an <code>InteractiveObject</code> to be precise). I handle both <code>KEY_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> and <code>MOUSE_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> events while trying to prevent losing focus <code>FocusEvent.preventDefault()</code>. But I still manage to lose the focus by mouse clicking. What’s even weirder is that when I force the focus using the <code>Stage.focus</code> property, I get an ugly looking thick yellow line around my movie clip. In presumably indicates that the movie clips is focused, but normally it’s not anywhere. Does it mean that the object is not focusable, but I somehow force focus it anyway?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that the questions above are not very clear and I don’t expect to actually answer them. But what I’m trying to indicate is that it seems that I’m doing something wrong. So the main question is that: Is there an easy way to get a modal behaviour in Flash? I think programming it from scratch and piping and handling variously little events is something I should not be doing.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that is irritating me the most is that I need this modal widow to handle and display some edge case error messages. And so putting so much effort into it does not seem right.

Thanks for reading and all your help.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT-\nI figured out how to do it.Adding some information in case some one has the same problem-\nFlex limits the size of your sprite( or any UI component) to the size of the container. If you try to go over the size of the container it just returns the size of the container. In my code-</p>\n\n<pre><code>override public function get width () : Number {\n            return _width;\n        }\n\noverride public function get height () : Number {\n            return _height;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is commonly touted as a fix to go over the size of the container. This approach is flawed however because it overrides everything that asks for width and height. In this case it tries to make everything the size of _height and _width. For any skin that has more than 1 component this is a huge problem, either you can try to set sizes for items indivigually, which for me didn't work or find an alternate approach.\nHere is what works-</p>\n\n<pre><code>public override function validateDisplayList():void {\n            super.validateDisplayList();\n            yourComponent.width = someConstantW;\n            yourComponent.height = someConstantH;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is not going to be enough however. You might need to move your component outside of the  container for this try-</p>\n\n<pre><code>override protected function layoutContents(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void {\n                super.layoutContents(unscaledWidth, unscaledHeight);\n                setElementPosition(yourComponent, x, y);\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hopefully I saved someone a few hours of work :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","air","adobe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13221399,"title":"Unable to find whats wrong with this code for adobe air","body":"<p>Working with an <em>adobe air app</em> for the first time.

I'm working on a chess-game, and trying to make it so that a \"public static boolean\" (turn) dictates which player can make a move. This boolean is in a class (Board.as) which imports all the classes for all the chess-pieces (e.g. QueenW.as (for the White Queen)).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried multiple ways: Trying to make functions not run anymore, and replacing the pieces (which are buttons) to other objects (non-clickable movieclips). Decided to go with the latter. I've traced the boolean in a chess-piece class, as well as the Board-class, in an ENTER_FRAME function. Both seem to trace it correctly when the value changes.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is: Flash doesn't remove the chess-pieces and replaces them with a non-clickable object, even though the class in which it should happen (Board.as) does listen to the boolean when tracing. Anybody knows a solution?</p>\n\n<p>A little piece of my code, which is relative to the problem:</p>\n\n<p>Board class (which is the Documentclass for my .fla file)</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n import QueenWclass; //imports the class used for example.\n\n public class Board extends MovieClip\n {\n  public static var turn:Boolean = new Boolean; //creates public static bool.\n  var queenW:QueenWclass = new QueenWclass(); //creates aforementioned chess-piece.\n\n  var queenWnoturn:QueenWnoturn = new QueenWnoturn; //creates a non-clickable object.\n }\n\n public function Board()\n {\n  turn = true;\n\n  this.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, frameEnter);\n\n  addChild(queenW); //adds pieces to the screen.\n }\n\n if (turn == true)\n {\n\n }\n\n if (turn == false)\n {\n  removeChild(queenW); //Removes chess-piece.\n  addChild(queenWnoturn); //Adds a non-clickable object.\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And my QueenWclass.as class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n public class QueenWclass extends MovieClip\n {\n  var queenW:QueenW = new QueenW();\n }\n\n public function QueenWclass()\n {\n  addChild(queenW);\n\n  this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, CLICKqueenW);\n }\n\n function CLICKqueenW(event.MouseEvent):void\n {\n  Board.turn = false;\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope I wrote this example correctly and understandably.

I mean SWFs that are found on your system locally but you need to add them to your program since they contain MovieClips or Sprites etc... that u need.

The issue is the child swf might also embed these fonts, but not explicitly so, meaning they are only embedded because there are fields in the child swf that use certain characters of a font. This means the text fields in the child use the incomplete embedded font instead of the embedded complete set that is registered in the parent or any level of grandparent. Also this means the swfs that may become children of this child won't get the complete font.</p>\n\n<p>My question:\nIs there any way to tell flash at compile to not embed, under any circumstances, fonts into a swf? If not is there a tool that removes embedded fonts from a compiled swf?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a few things I have given thought to/noticed so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It seems as if each Font class is tied to an ApplicationDomain. ( Confirmation of this would be helpful )</li>\n<li>Using device fonts on text fields will not cause any fonts to embed. ( Not an option for me however because I need the fields to embed fonts at runtime from a parent swf. )</li>\n<li>I can't find a way to unregister fonts or simply tell loaded child swfs to use parent fonts, which would be useful to apply to the loaded child swfs.</li>\n<li>It may be possible to load the child in a different context that would allow parent definitions of a fonts to override the child definitions. ( Or would there be two definitions and if so which one takes priority? )</li>\n<li>Loading assets from the library of the child and adding them to the stage will get the parent definition of the font. ( this makes sense because the asset is created outside the domain of the child )</li>\n<li>A possible solution might be to not add any characters to the textfields for compile of the swf, but this isn't really an option either because I need static text using any font.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've started forming a definition of what the problem is in my mind that may be incorrect, so please if necessary take a few steps back and give me a different perspective on the problem.

If I am using primitives for my interface, the Signal fails to find the Method and invoke it. And I don't like the idea passing the Method name to the signal. Any Ideas how to improve this?

XMLSocket not requesting policy file","body":"<p>I have found a lot of similar posts here, but none seem to address the exact issue I'm having.</p>\n\n<p>I am just trying to connect an XMLSocket to my server, and about 10 seconds after I attempt to connect, I get a SecurityErrorEvent: Error #2048: Security sandbox violation (cannotload data from ##.##.##.##:9024). </p>\n\n<p>Server-side, I have a php script that listens for port 9024. I'm pretty sure that is working right, because I can connect to it using other php scripts. Also, when my client-side php makes the policy-file request, my server script returns the policy. Here's the as3:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private var sock:XMLSocket  = new XMLSocket();\n\n// in my connection method\nSecurity.allowDomain(\"domain.com\");\nSecurity.loadPolicyFile(\"dubDomain.domain.com/crossdomain.xml\");\nSecurity.loadPolicyFile(\"xmlsocket://domain.com:9024\");\nsock.connect(\"11.11.11.11\", 9024);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I set listeners to the socket in as3 before calling sock.connect, but I think whatever goes wrong happens before they would be triggered.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that at either the second Security.loadPolicyFile, or the socket.connect should attempt to connect to the server at socket 9024 and request a policy file. I believe sock.connect would only send the request after it fails to get a response from port 843.</p>\n\n<p>On the server end, though, it shows no attempt is ever made to connect. I have tried this from the IDE(FlashDevelop), and from the swf when uploaded to the server. </p>\n\n<p>I would try it on port 843, but I don't have admin rights on my server. If it matters, here is a bit of the php script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$client = socket_accept($sock);\nif (socket_getpeername($client, $address, $theirport))\n{\necho \"Client $address: $theirport is now connected to us\\n\";\n}\n$input = socket_read($client, 1024000);\necho \"[client] $input\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>$sock seems to be set up fine, as I can connect using another php script, but it just waits forever when I try to connect with as3.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions? Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13083631,"title":"Variable value does not redirect to another frame","body":"<p>When my variable reaches the number 94, i am not redirected to the frame \"two\".

There are too many fields, with too many rules coded inside <code>visible</code> and <code>includeInLayout</code> conditions.

What I don't want to do is to include those labels as part of the form because it would make them a nightmare to maintain (they are already quite complex now).</p>\n\n<p>I know that I could easily create a custom component made of a text input box and a label, both wrapped inside a VGroup, where the label would just display if the input box's errorString was nonblank, and use that instead of text input boxes. However, I am worried about the performance. Basically, every lightweight text box would be replaced by an instance of this heavier component, each having to compute its layout, bindings, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I am looking for a way of adding and removing labels dynamically to my form, which is a hierarchy of VGroups and HGroups with some components inside. I could imagine adding them to a VGroup relatively easy. I guess adding them to an HGroup could be more complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally all the addition and removal of these labels would happen in an object detached from the form.

For each of these eight colours I have added a numerical variable (shapeCounterBlue, shapeCounterRed etc.) which basically counts ++ every time I add a shape of a certain colour to the stage and likewise it counts -- if I chose to remove a shape.</p>\n\n<p>As a shape is added through my main function I attach a dynamic textField to each MovieClip and populate it with the variable counter number for the particular colour I have selected (see image below).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKO0s.jpg\" alt=\"shapes\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>OK, so here is my issue. I need my unique number (displayed in white) for each coloured shape to dynamically re-populate and update when I remove a shape from the stage. As you can see in the image I’ve attached, if I were to remove the second blue shape, my third blue shape’s numbers would need to revert from 3 to 2.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise if I had six red shapes on the stage and I decided to remove the third one, then shapes 4,5,6 (before 3 is deleted), would need to have their numbers changed to 3,4,5 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Or I could have four green shapes and remove the first shape; this would mean that shapes 2,3,4 would actually need to change to be 1,2,3.</p>\n\n<p>You get the idea. But does anybody know how I could achieve this?</p>\n\n<p>My problem has further been hampered by the fact that the textFields for each MovieClip are added dynamically through my For Loop to the user_shape Child. This means that within my AS class, I haven’t been able to publicly declare these textFields and access the values within them, as they only exist in the For Loop used in my add shape function and no where else.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex","firefox","firebug"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":13060631,"title":"Logging with FireFox/FireBug","body":"<p>I have this code below, what do I need to be able to be able to log with <code>FireFox/FireBug</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n  import flash.display.Sprite;\n  import flash.external.ExternalInterface;\n\n  public class FlashRecorder extends Sprite {\n    public function FlashRecorder() {\n      var logger:Logger;\n      logger = new Logger();\n      ExternalInterface.addCallback(\"debugLog\", logger.debugLog);\n      var recorder = new Recorder(logger);\n      recorder.addExternalInterfaceCallbacks();\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Such that, when I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>logger.log('startPlaying');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It will be logged in Firefox/firebug</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","actionscript-3","flex","post","air"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":72,"score":1,"question_id":13060016,"title":"Flex AS3 - unable to send POST data","body":"<p>This would be idea of AS code (Flex/AIR platform):</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function login_btn_login_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n\n    var urlLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n    var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(config.domain+'/oms/request/user/login');\n\n    Alert.show(login_inp_username.text) // OK!\n    var requestVars:URLVariables = new URLVariables();\n    requestVars.username = login_inp_username.text;\n    requestVars.password = login_inp_password.text;\n\n    request.data = requestVars;\n    request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST\n    urlLoader.load(request);\n\n\n    urlLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,login_evt_complete);\n    urlLoader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR,login_evt_ioerror);\n\n\n}\n\nprotected function login_evt_ioerror(e:Event):void {\n        Alert.show('IO Error: Check connection')\n}\n\nprotected function login_evt_complete(e:Event):void {\n        //  var response:XML = e.currentTarget;\n        var response:XML = new XML(e.target.data);\n        Alert.show(response)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And PHP:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n    echo '&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n    &lt;result&gt;result:'.$_POST['username'].'&lt;/result&gt;\n';\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is all I get </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/J9nBh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>(Problem is that with PHP I can't read POST data... or they are not send):</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Any point to solution would be apreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","actionscript","semicolon"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":13060574,"title":"Syntax error: expecting semicolon before leftbracket","body":"<p>I have only been using ActionScript 3 for three days, so I'm a major newb, but I've used several other languages for most of my life.</p>\n\n<p>I have the following code at frame one of the top layer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var level:Array = new Array();\nvar level[0] = new Object();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am getting the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Scene 1, Layer 'levels', Frame 1, Line 2\n1086: Syntax error: expecting semicolon before leftbracket.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've looked at many examples which seem to be doing the same thing I'm doing, and I've also tried defining the object separately and then adding it to the array, with the same error.

So it's quite possible that a user can draw a line with thickness <code>0.1</code> or <code>300.0</code>, and it looks that line possible thickness (in <code>Graphics.lineStyle()</code>) has upper border.

I am using Adobe Flash with AIR and AS3 to code the game.  I am drawing my character, obstacles, and backgrounds in Adobe Illustrator.  The canvas in Flash is set to 960x640.  The character was intended to be 1/3 of the screen height so around 213 pixels high.  I designed the character in Adobe Illustrator to be somewhere around 900 pixels high.  When I imported the character into Flash I animated him, instantiated him using var player:Player = new Player(), and scaled him down to size using the scaleX and scaleY properties.  I tested it out on the desktop and Android phone and it looked wonderful.  However, when I tested it out on an iPhone, the player was unacceptably pixelated around the edges.  I figured the fact that I drew the animation much larger than the intended height must be the problem, so I redrew the player to exactly 213 pixels high and retested on the iPhone without any improvement in the quality of the animation.

Can anybody help me please.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n   &lt;s:View xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n    xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\"\n    initialize=\"main()\" textAlign=\"right\" textRotation=\"rotate270\" title=\"HomeView\"&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n\n            import mx.collections.ArrayList;\n            import mx.graphics.SolidColorStroke;\n\n            import spark.primitives.Rect;\n            import spark.skins.spark.DefaultComplexItemRenderer;\n            import spark.skins.spark.DefaultItemRenderer;\n            private var bL:ArrayList;\n\n            public function main():void{\n\n\n            hey.dataProvider=dataprovider;      \n            }\n\n\n\n\n        ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here --&gt;\n        &lt;s:ArrayList id=\"dataprovider\"&gt;\n\n\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n                &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:ArrayList&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;\n    &lt;s:DataGrid id=\"hey\" x=\"-2\" y=\"-1\" width=\"323\" height=\"415\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:columns&gt;\n            &lt;s:ArrayList&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:GridColumn id=\"my\" dataField=\"wierd\"&gt;\n\n                &lt;/s:GridColumn&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:GridColumn id=\"hi\" dataField=\"checkboxes\"&gt;\n\n                    &lt;s:itemRenderer&gt;\n                        &lt;fx:Component&gt;\n                            &lt;s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n\n                                &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n                                    &lt;![CDATA[\n            protected function checkbox1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void\n                                        {\n                                    trace(\"clicked\");\n                                        }\n                                    ]]&gt;\n                                &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:CheckBox click=\"checkbox1_clickHandler(event)\"&gt;\n\n                                &lt;/s:CheckBox&gt;\n                            &lt;/s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n\n                        &lt;/fx:Component&gt;\n\n                    &lt;/s:itemRenderer&gt;\n\n                &lt;/s:GridColumn&gt;\n\n            &lt;/s:ArrayList&gt;\n\n        &lt;/s:columns&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;/s:DataGrid&gt;\n   &lt;/s:View&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":0,"question_id":12071131,"title":"FLASH AS3 SOUND_COMPLETE firing at start of sound","body":"<p>The gotoAndStop() method is called on the sound being loaded, the trace is fired when the sound has finished.

How would I formulate that?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function startup():void\n{\n     lastFrame = new Date();\n     new Bounce().startupBounce();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help or pointer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","actionscript-3","externalinterface"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":70,"score":1,"question_id":12957425,"title":"Using ExternalInterface with xml prettyPhoto url","body":"<p>I've been trying to get to use the <code>ExternalInterface</code> through an xml file passing the variables for the info into Flash AS3 and can't work out how to get the data to change with each new selection made.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to get it to call the <code>ExternalInterface</code> and use the initial data however I can't seem to get it to change.</p>\n\n<p>I have in the HTML the following code for prettyPhoto lightbox which works as expected so far :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n$(\"a[rel^='prettyPhoto']\").prettyPhoto({hideflash: false, allow_resize: true, callback: function() {PAYPAL.apps.MiniCart.hide(null);}\n});\n});\nfunction launchPrettyPhoto(urlContent) {\n        $.prettyPhoto.open(urlContent);\n     }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To call in the xml data I have a number of fields representing images, thumbs, title, description, and my url for the link to activate the lightbox, as below :</p>\n\n<pre><code>function loadXML(event:Event):void {\nxml=new XML(event.target.data);\nvar total:Number=xml.pic.length();\nfor (var i:int = 0; i &lt; total; i++) {\n    thumbs[i]=xml.pic.thumb.text()[i];\n    images[i]=xml.pic.image.text()[i];\n    titles[i]=xml.pic.title.text()[i];\n    descriptions[i]=xml.pic.desc.text()[i];\n    wwwlink[i]=xml.pic.link.text()[i];\n}\nloadThumbs();\ntrace(\"loading thumbs\");    \nloader.removeEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, loadXML);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On each change of the image, data is updated via the following points whereby (ideally) the <code>ExternalInterface</code> 'url' should change as well, this I'm having problems with.</p>\n\n<p>On each new selection the data is passed :</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainLoader.load(mainRequest);\ntitle_txt.text = titles[theImg]; //Output title\ndesc_txt.text = descriptions[theImg]; Output Description\nlink_txt.htmlText = wwwlink[theImg]; Output URL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a button to call the function which initiates the <code>ExternalInterface</code> below :</p>\n\n<pre><code>function callPrettyPhoto(url:String):void{\ntrace(\"Calling lightbox\");\nif (ExternalInterface.available) {\n    // ExternalInterface calls function\n    ExternalInterface.call(\"launchPrettyPhoto\", url);\n}\ntrace(ExternalInterface.call);\n}\n\nfunction initCall(event:MouseEvent):void {\n// Call ExternalInterface\ncallPrettyPhoto(xml.pic.link.text());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As it stands, everything works well except that when I change image it fails to update or change the 'url', the rest works as in it updates everything accordingly and calls the lightbox as wanted.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can see, the line below is the instigator as it seems to reference the first url in the xml file and fails to update with the rest :</p>\n\n<pre><code>callPrettyPhoto(xml.pic.link.text());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried but can't quite wrestle it into submission and would appreciate your experienced input into where I'm going wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>XML</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;images&gt;\n&lt;pic&gt;\n    &lt;image&gt;images/01_00_00.jpg&lt;/image&gt;\n    &lt;thumb&gt;images/_t01_00_00.jpg&lt;/thumb&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;First Picture&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;desc&gt;Typical description&lt;/desc&gt;\n    &lt;link&gt;&lt;![CDATA[http://www.website.com/_i01_00_01.html?iframe=true&amp;width=100%&amp;height=100%]]&gt;&lt;/link&gt;\n&lt;/pic&gt;\n&lt;/images&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","embedded-resource","haxe"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":690,"score":1,"question_id":3664148,"title":"HaXe -- Embed files like in ActionScript?","body":"<p>In ActionScript, you can do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Embed(source = \"src/myfile.xml\", mimeType = \"application/octet-stream\")]\nprivate var xml : Class;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it will embed your file to be used in code.

Is there any class or way to just draw the curve and attach the circle to that curve?\nHere are some pics: <br/> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h3sLC.jpg\" alt=\"Here is what senocular.com \">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3AAT.jpg\" alt=\"Here is what I want\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12966414,"title":"Pushing an spliced Array into an Array leaves me with a three times nested array","body":"<p>Im removing one array from an array of arrays unto an empty array</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _open:Array = [[x, y]];\nvar _closed:Array = [];\n\n_closed.push(_open.splice(0, 1));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which leaves me with array _closed being:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[[x, y]]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why?

It only happens in a User account, which only serves to confuse me more.</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","pdf","swf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":0,"question_id":12688606,"title":"load an external swf (FlashPaper pdf) into a flash project","body":"<p>I have to do a very simple <code>swf</code> application able to show a series of <code>pdf</code> files.\nActually I was able to create on a single layer the menu interface (some buttons on frame 0 which redirect the user to other frames where the pdf should be showed).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here my question:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I need a way to read the pdf inside the flash frame.</p>\n\n<p>I've found a possible solution converting the pdf into an swf with <code>FlashPaper 2</code>\nNow I wish to know how import the swf into the frame.</p>\n\n<p>Reading some actionscript 3 guides I was able to create a container movieclip (a simple rectangle) into which I have loaded the swf with this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var swf:MovieClip;\nvar loader:Loader = new Loader();\nvar defaultSWF:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"test.swf\"); //test.swf is my converted pdf\nloader.load(defaultSWF);\n\nscreen_01.addChild(loader); //screen_01 is the container rectangle converted to movieclip\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've used a container movieclip to mantain the other objects (menu buttons) on the frame, and ecause it helps with the swf positioning.<br>\nI seen it is possible also using <code>loader.x</code> and <code>loader.y</code> and it works.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to control width and height of the swf/pdf file (<code>loader.width</code> and <code>loader.height</code> exists but if used cause the swf will not loaded at all)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've found a possible solution at <a href=\"http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?297261-Flash8-loadMovie-set-size-of-the-movie\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>. <br> The idea is to change <code>swf</code> scale only after the load process is complete (positioning can be done even before).<br>\nAnyway I had to use <code>Actionscript 2</code> for this project because <code>FlashPaper</code> converted <code>pdf</code> doesn't work properly with <code>AS3</code>, I don't know why...</p>\n\n<p>here the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//insert an emplty movieclip to load the swf, I've called it screen_01\n\nvar movLoad:MovieClipLoader = new MovieClipLoader();\nvar myListener:Object = new Object();\n\nmyListener.onLoadInit = function(thisMc:MovieClip) {\n\n    thisMc._height = 600;\n    thisMc._width = 900;\n    thisMc._x = 50;\n    thisMc._y = 30;\n};\n\nmovLoad.addListener(myListener);\n\nmovLoad.loadClip(\"folder/flashpaper_converted_pdf.swf.swf\",screen_01);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","state","active"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":43,"score":-1,"question_id":12918922,"title":"add an active state in as3","body":"<p>In jquery I often add a class \"active\" to let me know if a div/img or whatever is in an active state.

Now, let's forget about the server side and just have a look on the following client side</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;\n\n    public class MyCollection extends ArrayCollection\n    {\n        public function MyCollection(source:Array=null)\n        {\n            super(source);\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Additionally, let's assume we have the following class and it is mapped to the server side class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    [Bindable]\n    [RemoteClass(alias=\"com.blog.ri.MyEntity\")]\n    public dynamic class MyEntity\n    {   \n        private var _myCollection:MyCollection;\n\n        public function get myCollection():MyCollection\n        {\n            if(_myCollection == null)\n                _myCollection = new MyCollection();\n\n            return _myCollection;\n        }\n\n        public function set myCollection(value:MyCollection):void\n        {\n            _myCollection = value;\n        }       \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, the server side service expose for clients the void save(MyEntity candidate) method and I implemented it on the client side as it shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    public class MyService\n    {       \n        private var _remoteObject:RemoteObject;\n\n        public function MyService()\n        {\n            var channelSet:ChannelSet = new ChannelSet();\n            var amfChannel:AMFChannel = new AMFChannel(\"my-amf\", \"http://localhost/weborb.aspx\");\n            channelSet.addChannel(amfChannel);\n\n            _remoteObject  = new RemoteObject(\"GenericDestination\");\n            _remoteObject.channelSet = channelSet;\n            _remoteObject.source = \"com.blog.ri.MyService\";\n            _remoteObject.getDetailedStatistic.addEventListener(\"result\",onItemSaved);\n            _remoteObject.addEventListener(\"fault\", onFault);\n        }\n\n        public function save(candidate:MyEntity, responder:IResponder = null ):void\n        {\n            var asyncToken:AsyncToken = _remoteObject.save(candidate);\n\n            if( responder != null )\n                asyncToken.addResponder( responder );\n        }\n\n    }\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, I tried to save a new instance of the MyEntity class in our main mxml file as it shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function creationCompleteHandler():void\n            {\n                var myService:MyService = new MyService();\n\n                var candidate:MyEntity = new MyEntity();\n                candidate.myCollection = new MyCollection();\n\n                myService.save(candidate);\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is it. When I run the code, I received the following exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ArgumentError: Error #2004: One of the parameters is invalid.     at\n  flash.net::NetConnection/invokeWithArgsArray()    at\n  flash.net::NetConnection/call()   at\n  mx.messaging.channels::NetConnectionChannel/internalSend()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\NetConnectionChannel.as:281]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::AMFChannel/internalSend()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\AMFChannel.as:364]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::Channel/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\Channel.as:1002]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::PollingChannel/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\PollingChannel.as:394]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::ChannelSet/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\ChannelSet.as:1429]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::ChannelSet/channelConnectHandler()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\ChannelSet.as:1084]\n    at flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEventFunction()    at\n  flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEvent()     at\n  mx.messaging::Channel/connectSuccess()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\Channel.as:1148]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::AMFChannel/resultHandler()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\AMFChannel.as:576]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, I extended the ArrayCollection class and according to the Adobe documentation, the ArrayCollection implements the <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/utils/IExternalizable.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">IExternalizable interface</a>. I decided to localize the problem and created a simple class that implements IExternalizable. Then, I extended this class in some other MyChild class and defined the MyChild property in the MyEntity class. In this case, I received the exception above as well. Is there a problem how I wrote the code or it is a bug within flex?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help. \nThe question is duplicated in my blog.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":0,"question_id":12868990,"title":"AS3 Bouncing Ball","body":"<p>Okay, after learning tutorials online, I'm trying to make a bouncing ball in AS3.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code thus far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var count:Number = 0;\nvar bounceHeight:Number = 100;\nvar floorHeight:Number = 300;\nvar speed:Number = .1;\n\nfunction run(e:Event):void\n{\nball_mc.y = floorHeight - Math.abs(Math.cos(count)) * bounceHeight;\ncount += speed;\n}\n\n{\nthis.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME(run));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The compiler errors are</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scene 1, Layer 'Layer 1', Frame 1, Line 13    1195: Attempted access of\n  inaccessible method ENTER_FRAME through a reference with static type\n  Class.</p>\n  \n  <p>Scene 1, Layer 'Layer 1', Frame 1, Line 13    1136: Incorrect\n  number of arguments.

Then, tcpflow shows that all buffered data is sent to the client, but the client don't receives data. some seconds after that, connection dissapears from netstat and tcpflow shows that the same data is sent again, but this time the client receives the data so starts sending data to the server and the server receives it.

I think the answer is that the client is not the one closing the connection, is the kernel.

One is an image of a background (not solid, it has varying pixels), and another is of something (like a sprite) on top of the exact same background. Now what I want to do is remove the background from the second image, by comparing the two images, and removing all the pixels from the background that are present in the second image.\nFor clarity, basically I want to do <a href=\"http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/1511/remove-identical-pixels-in-two-layers-images-with-free-software\">this</a> in AS3.</p>\n\n<p>Now I came up with two ways to do this, and they both work perfectly. One compares pixels directly, while the other uses the <code>BitmapData.compare()</code> method first, then copies the appropriate pixels into the result. What I want to know is which way is faster.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my two ways of doing it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var j:int = 0; j &lt; layer1.height; j++)\n{\n    for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; layer1.width; i++)\n    {\n        if (layer1.getPixel32(i, j) != layer2.getPixel32(i, j))\n        {\n            result.setPixel32(i, j, layer2.getPixel32(i, j));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>result = layer1.compare(layer2) as BitmapData;\n\nfor (var j:int = 0; j &lt; layer1.height; j++)\n{\n    for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; layer1.width; i++)\n    {\n        if (result.getPixel32(i, j) != 0x00000000)\n        {\n            result.setPixel32(i, j, layer2.getPixel32(i, j));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>layer1</code> is the background, <code>layer2</code> is the image the background will be removed from, and <code>result</code> is just a <code>BitmapData</code> that the result will come out on.</p>\n\n<p>These are very similar, and personally I haven't noticed any difference in speed, but I was just wondering if anybody knows which would be faster. I'll probably use Method 1 either way, since <code>BitmapData.compare()</code> doesn't compare pixel alpha unless the colours are identical, but I still thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","garbage-collection","weak-references","addeventlistener"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1533,"score":1,"question_id":2665721,"title":"AS3: Weak Listener References Not Appropriate During Initialization?","body":"<p>as i currently understand, if an event listener is added to an object with useWeakReference set to true, then it is eligible for garbage collection and will be removed if and when the garbage collection does a sweep. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public function myCustomSpriteClass() //constructor\n    {\n    this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseDownListener, false, 0, true);\n    this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, mouseUpListener, false, 0, true);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in this case, is it not appropriate to initialize an object with weak references event listeners, incase the garbage collector does activate a sweep removing the objects event listeners since they were added during initialization of the object?</p>\n\n<p>in this case, would it only be appropriate to create a type of deallocate() method which removes the event listeners before the object is nullified?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":12777915,"title":"Flash drag strange behavior","body":"<p>I have a fancy movie clip (with text and other movie clips inside it)\nthat I want to drag</p>\n\n<p>I can only drag internal parts of the movie clip but not the whole movie clip.</p>\n\n<p>My NOT working example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.swf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.swf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.fla\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.fla</a>   (cs5)</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>drag_1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, clickToDrag);\nfunction clickToDrag(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    event.target.startDrag();\n}\n\nstage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, releaseToDrop);\nfunction releaseToDrop(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    event.target.stopDrag();\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","image","embed"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":356,"score":0,"question_id":7633048,"title":"Is it possible to create dynamic embed function?","body":"<p>Is it possible to create dynamic embed function in ActionScript3 </p>\n\n<p>for example like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>     public function embedImage(path:String):Bitmap{\n            [Embed(source = path, mimeType = \"image/png\")]\n        var NewBitmapClass:Class;\n\n            var image:Bitmap=new NewBitmapClass();\n            return image;\n\n     }// tried it, it doesnt work\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or maybe in some other way, or even if it is at all possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","removechild","addchild"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":0,"question_id":12776807,"title":"loading new external swf to stage and definitly removing previous one","body":"<p>i have three movies:\n1) main movie\n2) external #1\n3) external #2</p>\n\n<p>When the main movie is opened it loads into new container \"MovieClip\" one of the external swf (depends on variable). in the main movie i have also a button that switch the external SWF to another.

In this genre of game, characters and items interact in complicated and unpredictable ways, such that long chains of in-game occurrences can happen in the space of a single turn, each one resulting from the last and often happening before the previous one is properly finished taking its course. A problem seems to arise when I find, in the middle of such a mess, that I need to prompt the player for input and act on it immediately, before anything else continues happening.</p>\n\n<p>If the UI were running on a separate thread such that the player could enter input and I could receive it without having to return from the entire stack of functions currently executing, then the sane way would be to simply call (from within whatever monumental nesting of function calls I happen to be inside) a function that waits for player input and then acts on it. But in AS3, this isn't possible; a function that waits for input before returning would simply cause the program to hang.</p>\n\n<p>In response to this sort of problem, people say that the correct solution is to break up my operations into pieces so that I can wait for user input and then resume what I was doing. This is lovely and works gracefully for the trivial examples that are usually provided with such suggestions, but in a case like this, where unpredictable and often random occurrences can lead to chains of dozens of complicated events at one time, any of which can suddenly require user input at any moment, the notion of \"resume what I was doing\" seems like a Herculean task.</p>\n\n<p>Am I left with no other choice but to store everything that happens in the game as a data structure that describes all of the details of the occurrence including how far it has progressed up to this point, so that I can suddenly quit what I was doing to wait for player input and then reconstruct the previous state of things, no matter how elaborate it may have been? The cumbersomeness of this task, in comparison to the ability to simply call a \"get_input\" function from anywhere and then go on my merry way, seems enough to dissuade me or anyone from using AS3. What am I missing? Is there a way of going about this that won't drive me insane, or should I just take this as a hint that AS3 is the wrong tool for the job?</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","actionscript-3","air","adobe","codesign"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":1,"question_id":12677529,"title":"Adobe AIR runtime","body":"<p>I have on <code>Mac OS</code>, an .app that is the result of an <code>AIR app installer</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I want to codesign that files from it and redistribute the application like a <code>.dmg</code> file or an installer.</p>\n\n<p>The question is that if you know if it is possible to make an installer or something that first checks if the <code>AIR runtime</code> is installed, and after that installs my application.\n(like <code>.NET framework CLIENT profile</code>)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","xml","actionscript-3","embed"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":457,"score":0,"question_id":8820677,"title":"How to embed flash SWF with XML in google sites gadget?","body":"<p>I am pretty new with AS3 and I´m in dark with an issue.\nI made a flash website and want it to run under sites.google.com\nThe swf file runs fine in any case, not when it´s embedded.

I use the example php file from the Facebook Developer docs. </p>\n\n<p>This is my as3 code. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public static function buyItem ():void\n        {\n            var theAction:String = \"buy_item\";\n            var order_info:Object = { \"item_id\":\"1a\" };\n            var jOrder:String = JSON.encode(order_info);\n            var data:Object = {\n                action:theAction,\n                order_info:jOrder,\n                dev_purchase_params: {\"oscif\":true}\n            };\n\n            Facebook.ui(\"pay\", data, purchaseCallback);\n\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think the json encoding might be the problem, but i'm not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I use the example php file from the Facebook Developer docs (excerpt):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n$app_secret = '***********************';\n\n// Validate request is from Facebook and parse contents for use.\n$request = parse_signed_request($_POST['signed_request'], $app_secret);\n\n// Get request type.\n// Two types:\n//   1. payments_get_items.\n//   2. payments_status_update.\n$request_type = $_POST['method'];\n\n// Setup response.\n$response = '';\n\nif ($request_type == 'payments_get_items') {\n  // Get order info from Pay Dialog's order_info.\n  // Assumes order_info is a JSON encoded string.\n  $order_info = json_decode($request['credits']['order_info'], true);\n\n  // Get item id.\n  $item_id = $order_info['item_id'];\n\n  // Simulutates item lookup based on Pay Dialog's order_info.\n  if ($item_id == '1a') {\n    $item = array(\n      'title' =&gt; '100 some game cash',\n      'description' =&gt; 'Spend cash in some game.',\n      // Price must be denominated in credits.\n      'price' =&gt; 1,\n      'image_url' =&gt; '**********************/banner1.jpg',\n    );\n\n    // Construct response.\n    $response = array(\n                  'content' =&gt; array(\n                                 0 =&gt; $item,\n                               ),\n                  'method' =&gt; $request_type,\n                );\n    // Response must be JSON encoded.\n    $response = json_encode($response);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help, is really appreciated. </p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","actionscript-3","air"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":83,"score":2,"question_id":11992525,"title":"Inviting facebook friends in Air app for iOS","body":"<p>I'm working currently on an Air app for iOS and i have some hard time trying to make \"invite friends\" button.
