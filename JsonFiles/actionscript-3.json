That means each card should have a place to store information about what file to show as its front face, and what file to show as its back face.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, create two variables in the Card component to store the file names. You might call these variables frontFile and backFile.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's think about the methods we need for our Card.\nTake another look at the application file. Notice that the app assumes it can make calls to functions named</p>\n\n<pre><code>makeCard(), passing it Strings to specify the suit and the value for this card\nturnUp()\nturnOver()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That means you'll need to define public functions for each of these calls. While you're at it, go ahead and define a function named turnDown as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the function makeCard, use the suit and value inputs to construct the filename to use for this card's front face. Set the frontFile property to this filename. You might also want to set the backFile, which is the same for all the cards.</p>\n\n<p>In the function turnUp, just set the card's source property to whatever String is stored in its frontFile property.</p>\n\n<p>In the function turnDown, set the card's source property to whatever String is stored in its backFile property.</p>\n\n<p>In turnOver, you'll want to check to see which file is showing, and change the source to show the other side of the card.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":2,"question_id":10211130,"title":"What is the most efficient way to replace the last occurrence of a string in AS3","body":"<p>String.replace replaces the first occurrence of a string in a string, but I'd like to replace the last occurrence of a string in a string.

The raisinOnce is a boolean that safeguards that the calories are not deducted before the cookie is added to the plate at least once.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function caloriesf(e:Event)\n{\n    calories.text=\"only \"+String(caloriesv)+\" calories!\";\n    if (((raisin.x &gt; plateminx &amp;&amp; raisin.x &lt; platemaxx)&amp;&amp; (raisin.y &gt; plateminy &amp;&amp; raisin.y &lt; platemaxx))&amp;&amp; raisinInPlate==false)\n    {\n        raisinOnce=true;\n        caloriesv+=50;\n        raisinInPlate=true;\n        return;\n    }\n    else if (((raisin.x &lt; plateminx &amp;&amp; raisin.x &gt; platemaxx)&amp;&amp;(raisin.y &lt; plateminy &amp;&amp; raisin.y &gt; platemaxx)) &amp;&amp; raisinOnce==true)\n    {\n        raisinInPlate=false;\n        caloriesv-=50;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now this works correctly when the cookie is added to the plate, but not when it is removed!

Is there a built-in functionality for it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m working on a Flash widget (in AS3), and I would like to be able to show a movie clip in a modal fashion. Essentially, I need a simple modal window inside the wieget. So far I learned that that I need to implement the \"modalness\" by myself (in AS3). There used to be something in previous versions of Flash and there is something in Flex, but I have not experience with Flax and I’m not sure what it involves.</p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to write it myself without any deep planning upfront and soon and hit some problems. It seems that the root of the problems is that I cannot keep a focus on a movie clip (or an <code>InteractiveObject</code> to be precise). I handle both <code>KEY_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> and <code>MOUSE_FOCUS_CHANGE</code> events while trying to prevent losing focus <code>FocusEvent.preventDefault()</code>. But I still manage to lose the focus by mouse clicking. What’s even weirder is that when I force the focus using the <code>Stage.focus</code> property, I get an ugly looking thick yellow line around my movie clip. In presumably indicates that the movie clips is focused, but normally it’s not anywhere. Does it mean that the object is not focusable, but I somehow force focus it anyway?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that the questions above are not very clear and I don’t expect to actually answer them. But what I’m trying to indicate is that it seems that I’m doing something wrong. So the main question is that: Is there an easy way to get a modal behaviour in Flash? I think programming it from scratch and piping and handling variously little events is something I should not be doing.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that is irritating me the most is that I need this modal widow to handle and display some edge case error messages.

Thanks for reading and all your help.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT-\nI figured out how to do it.Adding some information in case some one has the same problem-\nFlex limits the size of your sprite( or any UI component) to the size of the container. If you try to go over the size of the container it just returns the size of the container. In my code-</p>\n\n<pre><code>override public function get width () : Number {\n            return _width;\n        }\n\noverride public function get height () : Number {\n            return _height;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is commonly touted as a fix to go over the size of the container. This approach is flawed however because it overrides everything that asks for width and height. In this case it tries to make everything the size of _height and _width. For any skin that has more than 1 component this is a huge problem, either you can try to set sizes for items indivigually, which for me didn't work or find an alternate approach.\nHere is what works-</p>\n\n<pre><code>public override function validateDisplayList():void {\n            super.validateDisplayList();\n            yourComponent.width = someConstantW;\n            yourComponent.height = someConstantH;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is not going to be enough however. You might need to move your component outside of the  container for this try-</p>\n\n<pre><code>override protected function layoutContents(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void {\n                super.layoutContents(unscaledWidth, unscaledHeight);\n                setElementPosition(yourComponent, x, y);\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hopefully I saved someone a few hours of work :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","air","adobe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13221399,"title":"Unable to find whats wrong with this code for adobe air","body":"<p>Working with an <em>adobe air app</em> for the first time.

I'm working on a chess-game, and trying to make it so that a \"public static boolean\" (turn) dictates which player can make a move. This boolean is in a class (Board.as) which imports all the classes for all the chess-pieces (e.g. QueenW.as (for the White Queen)).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried multiple ways: Trying to make functions not run anymore, and replacing the pieces (which are buttons) to other objects (non-clickable movieclips). Decided to go with the latter. I've traced the boolean in a chess-piece class, as well as the Board-class, in an ENTER_FRAME function. Both seem to trace it correctly when the value changes.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is: Flash doesn't remove the chess-pieces and replaces them with a non-clickable object, even though the class in which it should happen (Board.as) does listen to the boolean when tracing. Anybody knows a solution?</p>\n\n<p>A little piece of my code, which is relative to the problem:</p>\n\n<p>Board class (which is the Documentclass for my .fla file)</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n import QueenWclass; //imports the class used for example.\n\n public class Board extends MovieClip\n {\n  public static var turn:Boolean = new Boolean; //creates public static bool.\n  var queenW:QueenWclass = new QueenWclass(); //creates aforementioned chess-piece.\n\n  var queenWnoturn:QueenWnoturn = new QueenWnoturn; //creates a non-clickable object.\n }\n\n public function Board()\n {\n  turn = true;\n\n  this.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, frameEnter);\n\n  addChild(queenW); //adds pieces to the screen.\n }\n\n if (turn == true)\n {\n\n }\n\n if (turn == false)\n {\n  removeChild(queenW); //Removes chess-piece.\n  addChild(queenWnoturn); //Adds a non-clickable object.\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And my QueenWclass.as class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n public class QueenWclass extends MovieClip\n {\n  var queenW:QueenW = new QueenW();\n }\n\n public function QueenWclass()\n {\n  addChild(queenW);\n\n  this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, CLICKqueenW);\n }\n\n function CLICKqueenW(event.MouseEvent):void\n {\n  Board.turn = false;\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope I wrote this example correctly and understandably.

I mean SWFs that are found on your system locally but you need to add them to your program since they contain MovieClips or Sprites etc... that u need.

The issue is the child swf might also embed these fonts, but not explicitly so, meaning they are only embedded because there are fields in the child swf that use certain characters of a font. This means the text fields in the child use the incomplete embedded font instead of the embedded complete set that is registered in the parent or any level of grandparent. Also this means the swfs that may become children of this child won't get the complete font.</p>\n\n<p>My question:\nIs there any way to tell flash at compile to not embed, under any circumstances, fonts into a swf? If not is there a tool that removes embedded fonts from a compiled swf?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a few things I have given thought to/noticed so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It seems as if each Font class is tied to an ApplicationDomain. ( Confirmation of this would be helpful )</li>\n<li>Using device fonts on text fields will not cause any fonts to embed. ( Not an option for me however because I need the fields to embed fonts at runtime from a parent swf. )</li>\n<li>I can't find a way to unregister fonts or simply tell loaded child swfs to use parent fonts, which would be useful to apply to the loaded child swfs.</li>\n<li>It may be possible to load the child in a different context that would allow parent definitions of a fonts to override the child definitions. ( Or would there be two definitions and if so which one takes priority? )</li>\n<li>Loading assets from the library of the child and adding them to the stage will get the parent definition of the font. ( this makes sense because the asset is created outside the domain of the child )</li>\n<li>A possible solution might be to not add any characters to the textfields for compile of the swf, but this isn't really an option either because I need static text using any font.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've started forming a definition of what the problem is in my mind that may be incorrect, so please if necessary take a few steps back and give me a different perspective on the problem.

If I am using primitives for my interface, the Signal fails to find the Method and invoke it. And I don't like the idea passing the Method name to the signal. Any Ideas how to improve this?

I'm pretty sure that is working right, because I can connect to it using other php scripts. Also, when my client-side php makes the policy-file request, my server script returns the policy. Here's the as3:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private var sock:XMLSocket  = new XMLSocket();\n\n// in my connection method\nSecurity.allowDomain(\"domain.com\");\nSecurity.loadPolicyFile(\"dubDomain.domain.com/crossdomain.xml\");\nSecurity.loadPolicyFile(\"xmlsocket://domain.com:9024\");\nsock.connect(\"11.11.11.11\", 9024);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I set listeners to the socket in as3 before calling sock.connect, but I think whatever goes wrong happens before they would be triggered.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that at either the second Security.loadPolicyFile, or the socket.connect should attempt to connect to the server at socket 9024 and request a policy file. I believe sock.connect would only send the request after it fails to get a response from port 843.</p>\n\n<p>On the server end, though, it shows no attempt is ever made to connect. I have tried this from the IDE(FlashDevelop), and from the swf when uploaded to the server. </p>\n\n<p>I would try it on port 843, but I don't have admin rights on my server. If it matters, here is a bit of the php script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$client = socket_accept($sock);\nif (socket_getpeername($client, $address, $theirport))\n{\necho \"Client $address: $theirport is now connected to us\\n\";\n}\n$input = socket_read($client, 1024000);\necho \"[client] $input\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>$sock seems to be set up fine, as I can connect using another php script, but it just waits forever when I try to connect with as3.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions? Am I misunderstanding something?

There are too many fields, with too many rules coded inside <code>visible</code> and <code>includeInLayout</code> conditions. I also have several controls per line, in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I have laid the form out, with VGroups and HGroups, I am adding code to validate text input fields. Setting the errorString of a component shows a nice red border around it but, since this is a mobile application, it will not show an error tooltip.</p>\n\n<p>I know there are ways of forcing an error tooltip to show, but I don't think that would look OK in my application because the input controls are too close to each other and the tooltips would just add to the clutter, or hide information from another control.</p>\n\n<p>What I would like to do is to display the error messages as red text, in a small font, immediately under the text boxes with errors. What I don't want to do is to include those labels as part of the form because it would make them a nightmare to maintain (they are already quite complex now).</p>\n\n<p>I know that I could easily create a custom component made of a text input box and a label, both wrapped inside a VGroup, where the label would just display if the input box's errorString was nonblank, and use that instead of text input boxes. However, I am worried about the performance. Basically, every lightweight text box would be replaced by an instance of this heavier component, each having to compute its layout, bindings, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I am looking for a way of adding and removing labels dynamically to my form, which is a hierarchy of VGroups and HGroups with some components inside. I could imagine adding them to a VGroup relatively easy. I guess adding them to an HGroup could be more complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally all the addition and removal of these labels would happen in an object detached from the form. It would just operate on the form.</p>\n\n<p>Does anything like this exist, or is there a simple way to achieve it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","date","input"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":865,"score":3,"question_id":4187449,"title":"Input Textfield date mask","body":"<p>I need to restrict my users to input only dates with a custom format.

For each of these eight colours I have added a numerical variable (shapeCounterBlue, shapeCounterRed etc.) which basically counts ++ every time I add a shape of a certain colour to the stage and likewise it counts -- if I chose to remove a shape.</p>\n\n<p>As a shape is added through my main function I attach a dynamic textField to each MovieClip and populate it with the variable counter number for the particular colour I have selected (see image below).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKO0s.jpg\" alt=\"shapes\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>OK, so here is my issue. I need my unique number (displayed in white) for each coloured shape to dynamically re-populate and update when I remove a shape from the stage. As you can see in the image I’ve attached, if I were to remove the second blue shape, my third blue shape’s numbers would need to revert from 3 to 2.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise if I had six red shapes on the stage and I decided to remove the third one, then shapes 4,5,6 (before 3 is deleted), would need to have their numbers changed to 3,4,5 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Or I could have four green shapes and remove the first shape; this would mean that shapes 2,3,4 would actually need to change to be 1,2,3.</p>\n\n<p>You get the idea. But does anybody know how I could achieve this?</p>\n\n<p>My problem has further been hampered by the fact that the textFields for each MovieClip are added dynamically through my For Loop to the user_shape Child. This means that within my AS class, I haven’t been able to publicly declare these textFields and access the values within them, as they only exist in the For Loop used in my add shape function and no where else.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex","firefox","firebug"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13060631,"title":"Logging with FireFox/FireBug","body":"<p>I have this code below, what do I need to be able to be able to log with <code>FireFox/FireBug</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package {\n  import flash.display.Sprite;\n  import flash.external.ExternalInterface;\n\n  public class FlashRecorder extends Sprite {\n    public function FlashRecorder() {\n      var logger:Logger;\n      logger = new Logger();\n      ExternalInterface.addCallback(\"debugLog\", logger.debugLog);\n      var recorder = new Recorder(logger);\n      recorder.addExternalInterfaceCallbacks();\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Such that, when I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>logger.log('startPlaying');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It will be logged in Firefox/firebug</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","actionscript-3","flex","post","air"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":72,"score":1,"question_id":13060016,"title":"Flex AS3 - unable to send POST data","body":"<p>This would be idea of AS code (Flex/AIR platform):</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function login_btn_login_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n\n    var urlLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n    var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(config.domain+'/oms/request/user/login');\n\n    Alert.show(login_inp_username.text) // OK!\n    var requestVars:URLVariables = new URLVariables();\n    requestVars.username = login_inp_username.text;\n    requestVars.password = login_inp_password.text;\n\n    request.data = requestVars;\n    request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST\n    urlLoader.load(request);\n\n\n    urlLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,login_evt_complete);\n    urlLoader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR,login_evt_ioerror);\n\n\n}\n\nprotected function login_evt_ioerror(e:Event):void {\n        Alert.show('IO Error: Check connection')\n}\n\nprotected function login_evt_complete(e:Event):void {\n        //  var response:XML = e.currentTarget;\n        var response:XML = new XML(e.target.data);\n        Alert.show(response)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And PHP:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n    echo '&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n    &lt;result&gt;result:'.$_POST['username'].'&lt;/result&gt;\n';\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is all I get </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/J9nBh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>(Problem is that with PHP I can't read POST data... or they are not send):</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Any point to solution would be apreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","actionscript","semicolon"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":13060574,"title":"Syntax error: expecting semicolon before leftbracket","body":"<p>I have only been using ActionScript 3 for three days, so I'm a major newb, but I've used several other languages for most of my life.</p>\n\n<p>I have the following code at frame one of the top layer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var level:Array = new Array();\nvar level[0] = new Object();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am getting the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Scene 1, Layer 'levels', Frame 1, Line 2\n1086: Syntax error: expecting semicolon before leftbracket.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've looked at many examples which seem to be doing the same thing I'm doing, and I've also tried defining the object separately and then adding it to the array, with the same error.

So it's quite possible that a user can draw a line with thickness <code>0.1</code> or <code>300.0</code>, and it looks that line possible thickness (in <code>Graphics.lineStyle()</code>) has upper border.

I am using Adobe Flash with AIR and AS3 to code the game.  I am drawing my character, obstacles, and backgrounds in Adobe Illustrator.  The canvas in Flash is set to 960x640.  The character was intended to be 1/3 of the screen height so around 213 pixels high.  I designed the character in Adobe Illustrator to be somewhere around 900 pixels high.  When I imported the character into Flash I animated him, instantiated him using var player:Player = new Player(), and scaled him down to size using the scaleX and scaleY properties.  I tested it out on the desktop and Android phone and it looked wonderful.  However, when I tested it out on an iPhone, the player was unacceptably pixelated around the edges.  I figured the fact that I drew the animation much larger than the intended height must be the problem, so I redrew the player to exactly 213 pixels high and retested on the iPhone without any improvement in the quality of the animation.

Can anybody help me please.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n   &lt;s:View xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n    xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\"\n    initialize=\"main()\" textAlign=\"right\" textRotation=\"rotate270\" title=\"HomeView\"&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n\n            import mx.collections.ArrayList;\n            import mx.graphics.SolidColorStroke;\n\n            import spark.primitives.Rect;\n            import spark.skins.spark.DefaultComplexItemRenderer;\n            import spark.skins.spark.DefaultItemRenderer;\n            private var bL:ArrayList;\n\n            public function main():void{\n\n\n            hey.dataProvider=dataprovider;      \n            }\n\n\n\n\n        ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here --&gt;\n        &lt;s:ArrayList id=\"dataprovider\"&gt;\n\n\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n                &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"1\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\" name=\"3\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\" name=\"4\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact1\" actnumber=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Object actName=\"myact2\" actnumber=\"55\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:ArrayList&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;\n    &lt;s:DataGrid id=\"hey\" x=\"-2\" y=\"-1\" width=\"323\" height=\"415\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:columns&gt;\n            &lt;s:ArrayList&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:GridColumn id=\"my\" dataField=\"wierd\"&gt;\n\n                &lt;/s:GridColumn&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:GridColumn id=\"hi\" dataField=\"checkboxes\"&gt;\n\n                    &lt;s:itemRenderer&gt;\n                        &lt;fx:Component&gt;\n                            &lt;s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n\n                                &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n                                    &lt;![CDATA[\n            protected function checkbox1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void\n                                        {\n                                    trace(\"clicked\");\n                                        }\n                                    ]]&gt;\n                                &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n\n                &lt;s:CheckBox click=\"checkbox1_clickHandler(event)\"&gt;\n\n                                &lt;/s:CheckBox&gt;\n                            &lt;/s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n\n                        &lt;/fx:Component&gt;\n\n                    &lt;/s:itemRenderer&gt;\n\n                &lt;/s:GridColumn&gt;\n\n            &lt;/s:ArrayList&gt;\n\n        &lt;/s:columns&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;/s:DataGrid&gt;\n   &lt;/s:View&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":0,"question_id":12071131,"title":"FLASH AS3 SOUND_COMPLETE firing at start of sound","body":"<p>The gotoAndStop() method is called on the sound being loaded, the trace is fired when the sound has finished.

How would I formulate that?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function startup():void\n{\n     lastFrame = new Date();\n     new Bounce().startupBounce();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help or pointer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","actionscript-3","externalinterface"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":70,"score":1,"question_id":12957425,"title":"Using ExternalInterface with xml prettyPhoto url","body":"<p>I've been trying to get to use the <code>ExternalInterface</code> through an xml file passing the variables for the info into Flash AS3 and can't work out how to get the data to change with each new selection made.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to get it to call the <code>ExternalInterface</code> and use the initial data however I can't seem to get it to change.</p>\n\n<p>I have in the HTML the following code for prettyPhoto lightbox which works as expected so far :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n$(\"a[rel^='prettyPhoto']\").prettyPhoto({hideflash: false, allow_resize: true, callback: function() {PAYPAL.apps.MiniCart.hide(null);}\n});\n});\nfunction launchPrettyPhoto(urlContent) {\n        $.prettyPhoto.open(urlContent);\n     }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To call in the xml data I have a number of fields representing images, thumbs, title, description, and my url for the link to activate the lightbox, as below :</p>\n\n<pre><code>function loadXML(event:Event):void {\nxml=new XML(event.target.data);\nvar total:Number=xml.pic.length();\nfor (var i:int = 0; i &lt; total; i++) {\n    thumbs[i]=xml.pic.thumb.text()[i];\n    images[i]=xml.pic.image.text()[i];\n    titles[i]=xml.pic.title.text()[i];\n    descriptions[i]=xml.pic.desc.text()[i];\n    wwwlink[i]=xml.pic.link.text()[i];\n}\nloadThumbs();\ntrace(\"loading thumbs\");    \nloader.removeEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, loadXML);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On each change of the image, data is updated via the following points whereby (ideally) the <code>ExternalInterface</code> 'url' should change as well, this I'm having problems with.</p>\n\n<p>On each new selection the data is passed :</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainLoader.load(mainRequest);\ntitle_txt.text = titles[theImg]; //Output title\ndesc_txt.text = descriptions[theImg]; Output Description\nlink_txt.htmlText = wwwlink[theImg]; Output URL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a button to call the function which initiates the <code>ExternalInterface</code> below :</p>\n\n<pre><code>function callPrettyPhoto(url:String):void{\ntrace(\"Calling lightbox\");\nif (ExternalInterface.available) {\n    // ExternalInterface calls function\n    ExternalInterface.call(\"launchPrettyPhoto\", url);\n}\ntrace(ExternalInterface.call);\n}\n\nfunction initCall(event:MouseEvent):void {\n// Call ExternalInterface\ncallPrettyPhoto(xml.pic.link.text());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As it stands, everything works well except that when I change image it fails to update or change the 'url', the rest works as in it updates everything accordingly and calls the lightbox as wanted.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can see, the line below is the instigator as it seems to reference the first url in the xml file and fails to update with the rest :</p>\n\n<pre><code>callPrettyPhoto(xml.pic.link.text());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried but can't quite wrestle it into submission and would appreciate your experienced input into where I'm going wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>XML</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;images&gt;\n&lt;pic&gt;\n    &lt;image&gt;images/01_00_00.jpg&lt;/image&gt;\n    &lt;thumb&gt;images/_t01_00_00.jpg&lt;/thumb&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;First Picture&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;desc&gt;Typical description&lt;/desc&gt;\n    &lt;link&gt;&lt;![CDATA[http://www.website.com/_i01_00_01.html?iframe=true&amp;width=100%&amp;height=100%]]&gt;&lt;/link&gt;\n&lt;/pic&gt;\n&lt;/images&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","embedded-resource","haxe"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":690,"score":1,"question_id":3664148,"title":"HaXe -- Embed files like in ActionScript?","body":"<p>In ActionScript, you can do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Embed(source = \"src/myfile.xml\", mimeType = \"application/octet-stream\")]\nprivate var xml : Class;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it will embed your file to be used in code.

Is there any class or way to just draw the curve and attach the circle to that curve?\nHere are some pics: <br/> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h3sLC.jpg\" alt=\"Here is what senocular.com \">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3AAT.jpg\" alt=\"Here is what I want\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12966414,"title":"Pushing an spliced Array into an Array leaves me with a three times nested array","body":"<p>Im removing one array from an array of arrays unto an empty array</p>\n\n<pre><code>var _open:Array = [[x, y]];\nvar _closed:Array = [];\n\n_closed.push(_open.splice(0, 1));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which leaves me with array _closed being:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[[[x, y]]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why?

It only happens in a User account, which only serves to confuse me more.</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","pdf","swf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":89,"score":0,"question_id":12688606,"title":"load an external swf (FlashPaper pdf) into a flash project","body":"<p>I have to do a very simple <code>swf</code> application able to show a series of <code>pdf</code> files.\nActually I was able to create on a single layer the menu interface (some buttons on frame 0 which redirect the user to other frames where the pdf should be showed).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here my question:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I need a way to read the pdf inside the flash frame.</p>\n\n<p>I've found a possible solution converting the pdf into an swf with <code>FlashPaper 2</code>\nNow I wish to know how import the swf into the frame.</p>\n\n<p>Reading some actionscript 3 guides I was able to create a container movieclip (a simple rectangle) into which I have loaded the swf with this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var swf:MovieClip;\nvar loader:Loader = new Loader();\nvar defaultSWF:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"test.swf\"); //test.swf is my converted pdf\nloader.load(defaultSWF);\n\nscreen_01.addChild(loader); //screen_01 is the container rectangle converted to movieclip\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've used a container movieclip to mantain the other objects (menu buttons) on the frame, and ecause it helps with the swf positioning.<br>\nI seen it is possible also using <code>loader.x</code> and <code>loader.y</code> and it works.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to control width and height of the swf/pdf file (<code>loader.width</code> and <code>loader.height</code> exists but if used cause the swf will not loaded at all)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've found a possible solution at <a href=\"http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?297261-Flash8-loadMovie-set-size-of-the-movie\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>. <br> The idea is to change <code>swf</code> scale only after the load process is complete (positioning can be done even before).<br>\nAnyway I had to use <code>Actionscript 2</code> for this project because <code>FlashPaper</code> converted <code>pdf</code> doesn't work properly with <code>AS3</code>, I don't know why...</p>\n\n<p>here the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//insert an emplty movieclip to load the swf, I've called it screen_01\n\nvar movLoad:MovieClipLoader = new MovieClipLoader();\nvar myListener:Object = new Object();\n\nmyListener.onLoadInit = function(thisMc:MovieClip) {\n\n    thisMc._height = 600;\n    thisMc._width = 900;\n    thisMc._x = 50;\n    thisMc._y = 30;\n};\n\nmovLoad.addListener(myListener);\n\nmovLoad.loadClip(\"folder/flashpaper_converted_pdf.swf.swf\",screen_01);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","state","active"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":44,"score":-1,"question_id":12918922,"title":"add an active state in as3","body":"<p>In jquery I often add a class \"active\" to let me know if a div/img or whatever is in an active state.

Now, let's forget about the server side and just have a look on the following client side</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;\n\n    public class MyCollection extends ArrayCollection\n    {\n        public function MyCollection(source:Array=null)\n        {\n            super(source);\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Additionally, let's assume we have the following class and it is mapped to the server side class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    [Bindable]\n    [RemoteClass(alias=\"com.blog.ri.MyEntity\")]\n    public dynamic class MyEntity\n    {   \n        private var _myCollection:MyCollection;\n\n        public function get myCollection():MyCollection\n        {\n            if(_myCollection == null)\n                _myCollection = new MyCollection();\n\n            return _myCollection;\n        }\n\n        public function set myCollection(value:MyCollection):void\n        {\n            _myCollection = value;\n        }       \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, the server side service expose for clients the void save(MyEntity candidate) method and I implemented it on the client side as it shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.blog.ri\n{\n    public class MyService\n    {       \n        private var _remoteObject:RemoteObject;\n\n        public function MyService()\n        {\n            var channelSet:ChannelSet = new ChannelSet();\n            var amfChannel:AMFChannel = new AMFChannel(\"my-amf\", \"http://localhost/weborb.aspx\");\n            channelSet.addChannel(amfChannel);\n\n            _remoteObject  = new RemoteObject(\"GenericDestination\");\n            _remoteObject.channelSet = channelSet;\n            _remoteObject.source = \"com.blog.ri.MyService\";\n            _remoteObject.getDetailedStatistic.addEventListener(\"result\",onItemSaved);\n            _remoteObject.addEventListener(\"fault\", onFault);\n        }\n\n        public function save(candidate:MyEntity, responder:IResponder = null ):void\n        {\n            var asyncToken:AsyncToken = _remoteObject.save(candidate);\n\n            if( responder != null )\n                asyncToken.addResponder( responder );\n        }\n\n    }\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, I tried to save a new instance of the MyEntity class in our main mxml file as it shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function creationCompleteHandler():void\n            {\n                var myService:MyService = new MyService();\n\n                var candidate:MyEntity = new MyEntity();\n                candidate.myCollection = new MyCollection();\n\n                myService.save(candidate);\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is it. When I run the code, I received the following exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ArgumentError: Error #2004: One of the parameters is invalid.     at\n  flash.net::NetConnection/invokeWithArgsArray()    at\n  flash.net::NetConnection/call()   at\n  mx.messaging.channels::NetConnectionChannel/internalSend()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\NetConnectionChannel.as:281]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::AMFChannel/internalSend()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\AMFChannel.as:364]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::Channel/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\Channel.as:1002]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::PollingChannel/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\PollingChannel.as:394]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::ChannelSet/send()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\ChannelSet.as:1429]\n    at\n  mx.messaging::ChannelSet/channelConnectHandler()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\ChannelSet.as:1084]\n    at flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEventFunction()    at\n  flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEvent()     at\n  mx.messaging::Channel/connectSuccess()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\Channel.as:1148]\n    at\n  mx.messaging.channels::AMFChannel/resultHandler()[E:\\dev\\hero_private\\frameworks\\projects\\rpc\\src\\mx\\messaging\\channels\\AMFChannel.as:576]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, I extended the ArrayCollection class and according to the Adobe documentation, the ArrayCollection implements the <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/utils/IExternalizable.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">IExternalizable interface</a>. I decided to localize the problem and created a simple class that implements IExternalizable. Then, I extended this class in some other MyChild class and defined the MyChild property in the MyEntity class. In this case, I received the exception above as well. Is there a problem how I wrote the code or it is a bug within flex?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help. \nThe question is duplicated in my blog.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":73,"score":0,"question_id":12868990,"title":"AS3 Bouncing Ball","body":"<p>Okay, after learning tutorials online, I'm trying to make a bouncing ball in AS3.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code thus far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var count:Number = 0;\nvar bounceHeight:Number = 100;\nvar floorHeight:Number = 300;\nvar speed:Number = .1;\n\nfunction run(e:Event):void\n{\nball_mc.y = floorHeight - Math.abs(Math.cos(count)) * bounceHeight;\ncount += speed;\n}\n\n{\nthis.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME(run));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The compiler errors are</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scene 1, Layer 'Layer 1', Frame 1, Line 13    1195: Attempted access of\n  inaccessible method ENTER_FRAME through a reference with static type\n  Class.</p>\n  \n  <p>Scene 1, Layer 'Layer 1', Frame 1, Line 13    1136: Incorrect\n  number of arguments.

Then, tcpflow shows that all buffered data is sent to the client, but the client don't receives data. some seconds after that, connection dissapears from netstat and tcpflow shows that the same data is sent again, but this time the client receives the data so starts sending data to the server and the server receives it.

I think the answer is that the client is not the one closing the connection, is the kernel.

One is an image of a background (not solid, it has varying pixels), and another is of something (like a sprite) on top of the exact same background. Now what I want to do is remove the background from the second image, by comparing the two images, and removing all the pixels from the background that are present in the second image.\nFor clarity, basically I want to do <a href=\"http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/1511/remove-identical-pixels-in-two-layers-images-with-free-software\">this</a> in AS3.</p>\n\n<p>Now I came up with two ways to do this, and they both work perfectly. One compares pixels directly, while the other uses the <code>BitmapData.compare()</code> method first, then copies the appropriate pixels into the result. What I want to know is which way is faster.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my two ways of doing it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var j:int = 0; j &lt; layer1.height; j++)\n{\n    for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; layer1.width; i++)\n    {\n        if (layer1.getPixel32(i, j) != layer2.getPixel32(i, j))\n        {\n            result.setPixel32(i, j, layer2.getPixel32(i, j));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>result = layer1.compare(layer2) as BitmapData;\n\nfor (var j:int = 0; j &lt; layer1.height; j++)\n{\n    for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; layer1.width; i++)\n    {\n        if (result.getPixel32(i, j) != 0x00000000)\n        {\n            result.setPixel32(i, j, layer2.getPixel32(i, j));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>layer1</code> is the background, <code>layer2</code> is the image the background will be removed from, and <code>result</code> is just a <code>BitmapData</code> that the result will come out on.</p>\n\n<p>These are very similar, and personally I haven't noticed any difference in speed, but I was just wondering if anybody knows which would be faster. I'll probably use Method 1 either way, since <code>BitmapData.compare()</code> doesn't compare pixel alpha unless the colours are identical, but I still thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","garbage-collection","weak-references","addeventlistener"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1535,"score":1,"question_id":2665721,"title":"AS3: Weak Listener References Not Appropriate During Initialization?","body":"<p>as i currently understand, if an event listener is added to an object with useWeakReference set to true, then it is eligible for garbage collection and will be removed if and when the garbage collection does a sweep. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public function myCustomSpriteClass() //constructor\n    {\n    this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseDownListener, false, 0, true);\n    this.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, mouseUpListener, false, 0, true);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in this case, is it not appropriate to initialize an object with weak references event listeners, incase the garbage collector does activate a sweep removing the objects event listeners since they were added during initialization of the object?</p>\n\n<p>in this case, would it only be appropriate to create a type of deallocate() method which removes the event listeners before the object is nullified?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":12777915,"title":"Flash drag strange behavior","body":"<p>I have a fancy movie clip (with text and other movie clips inside it)\nthat I want to drag</p>\n\n<p>I can only drag internal parts of the movie clip but not the whole movie clip.</p>\n\n<p>My NOT working example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.swf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.swf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.fla\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.internetmotors.lv/temp/testgame_5.fla</a>   (cs5)</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>drag_1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, clickToDrag);\nfunction clickToDrag(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    event.target.startDrag();\n}\n\nstage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, releaseToDrop);\nfunction releaseToDrop(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\n    event.target.stopDrag();\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","image","embed"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":356,"score":0,"question_id":7633048,"title":"Is it possible to create dynamic embed function?","body":"<p>Is it possible to create dynamic embed function in ActionScript3 </p>\n\n<p>for example like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>     public function embedImage(path:String):Bitmap{\n            [Embed(source = path, mimeType = \"image/png\")]\n        var NewBitmapClass:Class;\n\n            var image:Bitmap=new NewBitmapClass();\n            return image;\n\n     }// tried it, it doesnt work\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or maybe in some other way, or even if it is at all possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","removechild","addchild"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":73,"score":0,"question_id":12776807,"title":"loading new external swf to stage and definitly removing previous one","body":"<p>i have three movies:\n1) main movie\n2) external #1\n3) external #2</p>\n\n<p>When the main movie is opened it loads into new container \"MovieClip\" one of the external swf (depends on variable). in the main movie i have also a button that switch the external SWF to another.

In this genre of game, characters and items interact in complicated and unpredictable ways, such that long chains of in-game occurrences can happen in the space of a single turn, each one resulting from the last and often happening before the previous one is properly finished taking its course. A problem seems to arise when I find, in the middle of such a mess, that I need to prompt the player for input and act on it immediately, before anything else continues happening.</p>\n\n<p>If the UI were running on a separate thread such that the player could enter input and I could receive it without having to return from the entire stack of functions currently executing, then the sane way would be to simply call (from within whatever monumental nesting of function calls I happen to be inside) a function that waits for player input and then acts on it. But in AS3, this isn't possible; a function that waits for input before returning would simply cause the program to hang.</p>\n\n<p>In response to this sort of problem, people say that the correct solution is to break up my operations into pieces so that I can wait for user input and then resume what I was doing. This is lovely and works gracefully for the trivial examples that are usually provided with such suggestions, but in a case like this, where unpredictable and often random occurrences can lead to chains of dozens of complicated events at one time, any of which can suddenly require user input at any moment, the notion of \"resume what I was doing\" seems like a Herculean task.</p>\n\n<p>Am I left with no other choice but to store everything that happens in the game as a data structure that describes all of the details of the occurrence including how far it has progressed up to this point, so that I can suddenly quit what I was doing to wait for player input and then reconstruct the previous state of things, no matter how elaborate it may have been? The cumbersomeness of this task, in comparison to the ability to simply call a \"get_input\" function from anywhere and then go on my merry way, seems enough to dissuade me or anyone from using AS3. What am I missing? Is there a way of going about this that won't drive me insane, or should I just take this as a hint that AS3 is the wrong tool for the job?</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","actionscript-3","air","adobe","codesign"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":1,"question_id":12677529,"title":"Adobe AIR runtime","body":"<p>I have on <code>Mac OS</code>, an .app that is the result of an <code>AIR app installer</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I want to codesign that files from it and redistribute the application like a <code>.dmg</code> file or an installer.</p>\n\n<p>The question is that if you know if it is possible to make an installer or something that first checks if the <code>AIR runtime</code> is installed, and after that installs my application.\n(like <code>.NET framework CLIENT profile</code>)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","xml","actionscript-3","embed"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":458,"score":0,"question_id":8820677,"title":"How to embed flash SWF with XML in google sites gadget?","body":"<p>I am pretty new with AS3 and I´m in dark with an issue.\nI made a flash website and want it to run under sites.google.com\nThe swf file runs fine in any case, not when it´s embedded.

I use the example php file from the Facebook Developer docs. </p>\n\n<p>This is my as3 code. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public static function buyItem ():void\n        {\n            var theAction:String = \"buy_item\";\n            var order_info:Object = { \"item_id\":\"1a\" };\n            var jOrder:String = JSON.encode(order_info);\n            var data:Object = {\n                action:theAction,\n                order_info:jOrder,\n                dev_purchase_params: {\"oscif\":true}\n            };\n\n            Facebook.ui(\"pay\", data, purchaseCallback);\n\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think the json encoding might be the problem, but i'm not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I use the example php file from the Facebook Developer docs (excerpt):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n$app_secret = '***********************';\n\n// Validate request is from Facebook and parse contents for use.\n$request = parse_signed_request($_POST['signed_request'], $app_secret);\n\n// Get request type.\n// Two types:\n//   1. payments_get_items.\n//   2. payments_status_update.\n$request_type = $_POST['method'];\n\n// Setup response.\n$response = '';\n\nif ($request_type == 'payments_get_items') {\n  // Get order info from Pay Dialog's order_info.\n  // Assumes order_info is a JSON encoded string.\n  $order_info = json_decode($request['credits']['order_info'], true);\n\n  // Get item id.\n  $item_id = $order_info['item_id'];\n\n  // Simulutates item lookup based on Pay Dialog's order_info.\n  if ($item_id == '1a') {\n    $item = array(\n      'title' =&gt; '100 some game cash',\n      'description' =&gt; 'Spend cash in some game.',\n      // Price must be denominated in credits.\n      'price' =&gt; 1,\n      'image_url' =&gt; '**********************/banner1.jpg',\n    );\n\n    // Construct response.\n    $response = array(\n                  'content' =&gt; array(\n                                 0 =&gt; $item,\n                               ),\n                  'method' =&gt; $request_type,\n                );\n    // Response must be JSON encoded.\n    $response = json_encode($response);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help, is really appreciated. </p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","facebook","actionscript-3","air"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":2,"question_id":11992525,"title":"Inviting facebook friends in Air app for iOS","body":"<p>I'm working currently on an Air app for iOS and i have some hard time trying to make \"invite friends\" button.

My problem is that it takes me mashing the link like 20 times on the iPad before it will recognize that there's a link and navigate to it in Safari.

I was having serious issues with collision detection, which the boffins of stackoverflow have helped me solve.  I was coding a tween for my object, a ball, to create a smooth roll effect because I hadn't been able to get it to move smoothly otherwise.  I finally had a eureka moment and managed to make the object move incrementally instead of teleporting and was able to eliminate my tween.  Without a tween, collision detection was working properly.  But I still have some issues.  First, how do I get gravity/friction to apply to the ball so that it doesn't come to a stop in a non-collision (or scoring) area when it otherwise runs out of steam?  Two, how can I make it collide properly with the boundaries so it reverses course at a proper rate?  And three, slightly unrelated but still a major challenge so I'll mention it now:  if my collision areas (scoring targets) are aligned vertically, can I put conditions in the collision detection to test for rate of speed to effectively collide with a target?

My, perhaps, awkward conditional chain of coordinate calculations largely works from an effectiveness POV, but the ball always seems to be removed several pixels(?) prior to the actual collision being measures - even accounting for bounding boxes as opposed to actual shapes.  I also attempted to turn the ball into a tween just before it was removed to make it fade away in a pretty manor, but that never seemed to work.  And I never even tried to tackle turning the arc-shaped \"bumpers\" under each target into actual collision objects that the ball could roll along if the aim was off.  That was just put into the \"too hard\" basket.  Below is my code for the collision measuring and the tweening, just in case anyone has any keen insights to add.

Creates a Space instance, then creates some walls and finally listens for Event.ENTER_FRAME to call Space.step() and to randomly create new Char instances.</p>\n\n<p>Now I understand that probably I should have created all 50 instances of Char class and Object pool them. But also I understand this only affects the performance at instantiation time. But probably that will be the first thing I will modify in the next commit. </p>\n\n<p>So, tested it on Browser and Air, it works just fine. Never drops from 60fps as expected. </p>\n\n<p>Then I tried it on my iPhone4S. Everything goes smooth at 60fps until I reach around 30 instances. Then it starts to drop very hard until it reaches 30fps. </p>\n\n<p>Also I have to add this: for some reason I'm having a lot of warnings from Nape SWC:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Description Resource    Path

I reckoned that the math principles would apply to other technologies too especially html5 canvas.  So in my curiosity I started converting ActionScript to JavaScript making some mental comparison in the process.  So far the principles and syntax has been very similar to my eyes but then I came upon this concept called \"Reparenting\".  I have the following code in ActionScript:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        parent1 = new Sprite();\n        addChild(parent1);\n        parent1.graphics.lineStyle(1, 0);\n        parent1.graphics.drawRect(-50, -50, 100, 100);\n        parent1.x = 60;\n        parent1.y = 60;\n\n        parent2 = new Sprite();\n        addChild(parent2);\n        parent2.graphics.lineStyle(1, 0);\n        parent2.graphics.drawRect(-50, -50, 100, 100);\n        parent2.x = 170;\n        parent2.y = 60;\n\n        ball = new Sprite();\n        parent1.addChild(ball);\n        ball.graphics.beginFill(0xff0000);\n        ball.graphics.drawCircle(0, 0, 50);\n        ball.graphics.endFill();\n        ball.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onBallClick);\n\nprivate function onBallClick(event:MouseEvent):void\n        {\n            if (parent1.contains(ball)) {\n                parent2.addChild(ball);\n            }else if (parent2.contains(ball)) {\n                parent1.addChild(ball);\n            }\n\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So every time the ball is clicked it transfers to the other rectangle, becoming that rectangle \"child\".

AS3 Project: Adding child from other class not visible; Keyboard input doesn't move child visually","body":"<p>I am starting a new project that is done 100% in FlashDevelop as an AS3 Project.  To clarify, I am not creating an FLA in Adobe Flash at any point; Adobe Flash will never be used.    </p>\n\n<p>In the document class of my AS3 project I will need to create and reference movieclips that are set up in separate .as class files.  The document class will have eventlisteners that watch for keyboard presses and move the movieclips when required.  Movements via the keyboard inputs work fine when the movieclip is set up and added to the stage from the document class.  However, I have problems when the movieclip is set up from a separate class.  </p>\n\n<p>Apart from my project I am working on, I have created a sample project that runs three tests for this Stack Overflow question.  This sample project contains three files all stored in the same folder: Main.as (the document class), createSquare.as (creates square MC), and createCircle.as (creates circle MC).</p>\n\n<p>Test #1 (Blue Rectangle): In Main.as I create a new MC called charRectangle.  The size, dimensions, color, etc are defined here and then it is added to the stage.  When the function keyIsDown() executes, the blue rectangle moves left or right on the stage correctly.  This is a succesful test.   </p>\n\n<p>Test #2 (Green Square): Now I test creating a movieclip from a separate class file.  In Main.as I create a new variable called charSquare and define it as a new createSquare().  createSquare.as defines the characteristics and adds the child to the stage.  Problem: When the project is tested no green square is visible on the stage; however, trace output shows the the left and right arrow keys are in fact updating the X position of charSquare.  How do I make the movieclip show? My solution to that is in...</p>\n\n<p>Test #3 (Yellow Circle): I start everything the same way for the yellow circle as I did for the green square.  We name this one charCircle.  In Main.as when defining the variable as a new charCircle() I pass along the word \"this\" to the function in createCircle.as.  This in turn tells the function createCircle to add the child to \"this\", the parent MC on the stage.  Now we can see a visible shape.  Problem: Trace output shows the left and right arrow keys are updating the X position, but the yellow circle does not move.  How do I make this movie clip move?</p>\n\n<p>Primary Goal: I want to avoid stating all the attributes of the character shapes in Main.as and keep that isolated to other class files.  In Main.as I want to just create a new variable, define it as a new createSquare()/createCircle(),and then use a keyboard function in Main.as to handle movements.  I would later keep keyboard controls in a fourth testing class called keyboardControls.as.  </p>\n\n<p>I can solve these problems when starting from an FLA in Adobe Flash, stating the document class, creating MC symbols on the stage,  giving them an instance name, and then working on the AS files in FlashDevelop.  But again, this project requires that I omit Adobe Flash/FLA so this is not the solution i am looking for..  I need to create it 100% dynamic in FlashDevelop AS3.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any and all assistance.

I'm adding functionality to my application so that if a user clicks one of the buttons around the transformed movieclip, a lightbox-style layer appears over the 3D-transformed movieclip.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm having is that when the lightbox layer appears, there's a perceptible shift in the location/transformation of the transformed movieclip, and when the lightbox layer is removed, the transformed movieclip returns to its original location.  Stranger still, this effect only happens about half the time; usually, the first couple of lightbox invocations have no effect, but the third or fourth causes the 3D movieclip to jump around.</p>\n\n<p>There's no 3D elements that are part of the lighbox (i.e. no z-indices are being explicitly set), and I can't find documentation of this phenomenon anywhere else.  Is this a bug in FP 10?  If it is, the only workaround I can think of is taking a snapshot of the 3D-transformed movieclip as <code>bitmapData</code> and showing that in place of the 3D mc whenever the lightbox appears, but that seems inefficient and brutally hackish.

Now I'm writing some new code to retrieve data from the server, but the server has to first process this data and this takes some time (say 5 to 30 minutes depending on the request). </p>\n\n<p>My design pattern up to now has been to show the user a busy cursor and disable the main application (Flex by default blurs out the application when it's disabled). This generally lasts a second or two while the communication completes. However, now the communication takes a long time to complete, and I'd like to be able to have the user continue to use the application even though the process from the server hasn't returned yet. </p>\n\n<p>So what I'd like to do is NOT disable the main application so the user can interact with it while he/she waits for the data to return. The problem I worry about is if the user uses the application to send another process to the server during this time (e.g. before the first process comes back) -- will this cause problems? That is, is BlazeDS smart enough to know the channel is busy and therefore will queue the requests automagically? For example, will BlazeDS wait until the first request comes back before sending the second, or third, etc?</p>\n\n<p>Or do I have to manually control this communication somehow to ensure it occurs in a serial fashion? If so, are there any design patterns to handle this?</p>\n\n<p>Or, can BlazeDS send and get back a second request before the first one returns?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice much appreciated. I'm looking for ways to avoid having the user stare at a unusable application for 5 to 30 minutes waiting for data to return. A busy cursor is fine, because it shows the data has not returned yet, but a disabled main application particularly (whether it's blurred or not) is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>Here I'm talking about simultaneous calls to different methods, rather than the same method. So if I have two methods, I'd like to call the first method, and while it is waiting to come back, call a second or third method, which return safely before (finally) the first method returns.

When the browser is resized I slide the component over, keeping it always 5 pixels from the edge of the browser. Once the stage has hit a minimum size (1024 for width) I stop sliding the GUI over otherwise it will start overlapping with other GUI's that are on the left side.

The graph starts scrolling to the left after it reaches the end of the screen (at N seconds). In other words, it keeps scrolling indefinitely after it hits the edge of its designated space. Here are the 3 ways I've attempted to implement this -- none of them are fast, and some of them have other problems.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Create and draw a new line segment at the corresponding timepoint on the graph -- the baseline segment (tiny horizontal line) and the tickmark (vertical). The graph only goes up to N seconds, but all tickmarks at times N+x are still drawn as if the graph went on forever to the right. I then use a mask for the rectangular area of the graph and literally move the graph to the left over time once it reaches N seconds.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This was slow to begin with, but led to incredible slowdown after a few minutes because Flash is apparently still processing the whole graph to the left, off-screen.</li>\n<li>Drawing line segments directly to the graph object is bad because each segment is apparently an object, and each of these myriad objects has no explicit (or implicit) reference after it is drawn. (\"Out of sight, out of mind\" == slow and wrong.)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Create a bitmapdata object containing the shape of a tickmark (small verticle line) and the baseline (tiny horizontal line), and every frame copypixel the next bitmap (line segment) into place on the graph object (now also a bitmap). ScrollRect to scroll to the left. Simple, very much like #1 except using bitmapData and copyPixel instead of display objects. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is bad news because after 2048 pixels, no more data can be drawn to the bitmap. </li>\n<li>Scaling the app caused all the bitmaps to appear rough and jagged, and for gaps to be introduced (despite flagging each bitmap \"smoothing on\"), likely because of the sheer number of line segments comprising a graph that are all disparate and drawn near other pixel boundaries.</li>\n<li>Scrollrect cannot be accelerated by the GPU (and the app needs to work on mobile devices)</li>\n<li>Maintaining concurrent bitmaps, copying and pasting one onto the other to refresh the graph (\"blitting\"?) is tedious, but it is also very inaccurate at the subpixel level, unlike the vector techniques. Also, the calculations required to either recalculate all peaks from scratch each frame or create, destroy, and merge multiple width-2048 bitmaps in the background may prove more costly in the long run. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Have one Shape, a horizontal line (baseline), \"scale up\" to fill the graph, then stop  (N seconds). Hence, it is the \"baseline\" since it appears to stretch across the graph with time and then do nothing after N seconds. Each tick atop the baseline, then, is a Shape object and is drawn on top of the baseline. A foreach loop then changes the x coordinates of all ticks until they reach the left of the graph, at which point they are made invisible and added to a recycle vector which will be used, if it contains anything, for any subsequent peaks coming in from the right (drawn at N). </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Still slow, but much faster than #1 and maintains constant speed when the graph starts scrolling. </li>\n<li>I can't figure out how to speed up the process. I've tried caching the background and the graph and even the line on top as bitmaps (even tried with cacheasbitmapmatrix), but it seems the plain vector rendering is fastest on the debug player.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Tween. Actually, haven't yet implemented the graph itself with tween, but so far, replacing my enterFrame movement handlers (which change coordinates of objects manually each frame) with Tweens has made all the animations much, much slower. Go figure. So I don't think it will help on the graph... I also can't use TweenLite (licensing).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With #3, I think I'm on the right track, but I fear I just don't know enough about the details of AVM rendering. Should I use bitmaps instead of Shapes for the peaks? Should I use the same technique as #1 with #3's objects (i.e. adding the peaks to a big moving \"tickSprite\" but still \"recycling\" the peaks when they go offscreen)? In this case, the containing Sprite, despite absence of ticks offscreen, will continue to be pushed to the left offscreen.

For instance, the Graph object itself is just a simple container for a Background shape (cached as bitmap) which is an alpha 0.75 gray rectangle behind the graph, a bunch of labels and axes (also cached as bitmaps), and the graph shapes (one scaling \"line\" Shape for the baseline and numerous \"tick\" Shapes stored in a vector)...\n- Users can drag normal vector objects behind the Graph, which might kill any performance benefit in caching the graph's children as bitmaps since they have to be rendered in motion over everything behind the alpha 0.75 background shape.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flash-cs5.5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":0,"question_id":12291962,"title":"AS3 - Timer - Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference","body":"<p>I have created a simple math game for preschool using flash cs5.5.

Haxe?","body":"<p>I'm planning on making a little game. And I'm looking for an engine. Basically what I want is Unity, but then 2D. It's a very interface heavy game, stylized, so what I need is an engine (or similar) in which it's easy to draw lines, primitives and text (and bitmaps, though that's less important.) The game will have a game world, though you'll never directly see it. All you'll get is a bunch of information about it (text, lines, graphs, ...) </p>\n\n<p>I know you could use Unity to make 2D games, though for what I have in mind it's not optimal and the way objects work in Unity isn't really how I want to structure my game. (I've worked a lot in Unity and absolutely love it, though I don't think it's the right tool for this game.)</p>\n\n<p>What I love about Unity is that you can just build for any platform, with a single click, and it just works. It also already has it's own way of building your gameobjects, and since I'm making something very different, I don't want this. I need more control over the objects and actually only want the engine to draw stuff.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about using Flash, ActionScript3. It should be very good at drawing lines and text. And hopefully just as easy to build.</p>\n\n<p>I also checked out HTML5 and javascript, using KineticJS, which can draw lines and primites very easily (pretty much exactly like I want it), though I hate javascript and want more structured code. Maybe it's just me that I can't get javascript to be clean enough for my taste, but well, that's something we'll have to live with then :P</p>\n\n<p>My question now is, since I never used flash. What are your thoughts on this. Is it perfect for this kind of stylized text-based games? Is it easy to build (I'm using FlashDevelop since that's a free way to make flash stuff)? On top of that, can I use a single code base for Windows and Mac (maybe even iOS, Android or other, though that's less important)?</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe you have another suggestion I could check out? (I already checked out a bunch of other question here, though none were really helpful. So yea it's another 'I'm looking for an engine' question, so don't kill me for that. I already did quite a bit of looking around, though would love some more input from others.)</p>\n\n<p>Edit1: I've been looking around some more and found Haxe (http://haxe.org/) seems promising, can anyone recommend this or?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot,</p>\n\n<p>-Pablo</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":263,"score":0,"question_id":7314669,"title":"How to Save Full Resolution Image Back to CameraRoll (Android)","body":"<ul>\n<li>Device - Nexus One  </li>\n<li>OS - Android 2.3.4 </li>\n<li>Class - CameraRoll </li>\n<li>Method - addBitmapData() </li>\n<li>Error - [ErrorEvent type=\"error\" bubbles=false\ncancelable=false eventPhase=2 text=\"Error #2038: File I/O Error.\"\nerrorID=2038]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm trying to develop a photo app but am having problems saving the full sized version of the image back to the CameraRoll.

This even though I've set the VGroup's left, top, and right, and have set paddingRight to 10 on the label.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;s:VGroup minHeight=\"0\"\n                left=\"16\" top=\"12\" right=\"4\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:HGroup width=\"100%\" gap=\"45\"&gt;\n              &lt;s:Label styleName=\"toastTitle\"\n                          id=\"titleLabel\" width=\"100%\" /&gt;\n              &lt;s:Button skinClass=\"skins.ToastCloseButtonSkin\" id=\"closeButton\"\n                            buttonMode=\"true\" useHandCursor=\"true\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:HGroup&gt;\n        &lt;s:HGroup&gt;\n              &lt;s:BitmapImage left=\"10\" top=\"16\"\n                                   source=\"assets/iconChatBubbleToastMsg.png\" id=\"chatIcon\"/&gt;\n              &lt;s:Label styleName=\"toastBody\"\n                          id=\"bodyLabel\"\n                          paddingRight=\"10\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:HGroup&gt;\n\n  &lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I fix this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12267336,"title":"PopupAnchor get focus doesn't work","body":"<p>I have textfied where popupAnchor appear when key.TABULATION is press.\nWhen popupAnchor appear, I'd like that the datagrid where is inside popupanchor get focus and I'd like to move inside this datagrid with keydown ans keyup but it doesn't work.</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;s:PopUpAnchor popUpPosition=\"topLeft\" id=\"popTypeRDV1\"\n                                           width=\"100%\" height=\"50%\" &gt;\n                                &lt;s:Group width=\"100%\" \n                                         focusOut=\"list1_focusOutHandler(event)\"\n                                         rollOut=\"list1_clickHandler(event)\" &gt;\n                                    &lt;s:Rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"&gt;\n                                        &lt;s:fill&gt;&lt;s:SolidColor color=\"0xFFFFFF\"/&gt;&lt;/s:fill&gt;\n                                        &lt;s:stroke&gt;\n                                            &lt;s:SolidColorStroke color=\"0xB9B9B9\" weight=\"1\" /&gt;\n                                        &lt;/s:stroke&gt;\n                                    &lt;/s:Rect&gt;\n                                    &lt;customDG:DgStyle id=\"dgTypeRDV1\" fontWeight=\"normal\" fontSize=\"10\"\n                                                      dataProvider=\"{DP_CHOIX_TYPE_RDV}\"\n                                                      doubleClickEnabled=\"true\"\n                                                      variableRowHeight=\"false\"\n                                                      width=\"200\" height=\"100%\"\n                                                      rowHeight=\"15\"\n                                                      keyDown=\"dgTypeRDV_keyDownHandler(event)\"\n                                                      doubleClick=\"dgTypeRDV_doubleClickHandler(event)\"\n                                                      &gt;\n                                        &lt;customDG:columns&gt;\n                                            &lt;mx:DataGridColumn dataField=\"trCode\" \n                                                               width=\"{dgTypeRDV.width*.3}\"\n                                                               /&gt;\n                                            &lt;mx:DataGridColumn dataField=\"trNom\" \n                                                               width=\"{dgTypeRDV.width*.7}\"\n                                                               /&gt;\n                                        &lt;/customDG:columns&gt;\n\n                                    &lt;/customDG:DgStyle&gt;\n                                &lt;/s:Group&gt;\n                            &lt;/s:PopUpAnchor&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Could you help me to solve that?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","actionscript-3","air","flex4"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":0,"question_id":12131752,"title":"Best Way To Download File Using Adobe AIR","body":"<p>I am creating adobe AIR application, which make request to php page to take backup of website and mysql and store it on website.

The code SWF files must load or embed the creative assets and interact with the code therein for our apps to function.</p>\n\n<p>For iOS mobile development, there is another consideration - it is not possible to load runtime code in an AIR app packages for iOS because of Apple TOS (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8688645/is-it-possible-to-embed-or-load-swfs-when-making-iphone-apps-is-it-allowed-by-a\">related question</a>).  Hence, it is not possible to use a Loader to load SWFs in an iOS environment and retain their code.</p>\n\n<p>Embedding a SWF into an ActionScript file the standard way results in a Loader that loads the embedded SWF directly as bytes.  This results in access to the top-level, main timeline as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\")]\n  private var no_aot_support:Class;\n\npublic function main():void\n{\n  var no_ios:* = new no_aot_support();\n  addChild(no_ios);\n  no_ios.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, function():void {\n    var timeline:MovieClip = no_ios.getChildAt(0).getChildAt(0);\n    trace(timeline.foo); // foo variable exists, output is 'blah'\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this embedding mechanism doesn't work on iOS devices because runtime-code is not allowed per Apple's TOS - all code must be passed through the ahead-of-time compiler (AOTCompiler) at compile-time, and the SWF embedded in this way does not meet this criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Asking around, I <a href=\"http://hybridmindset.com/blog/Rendering-Embedded-SWFs-On-iOS-Devices-Using-AIR-2.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">found</a> that one can use a class-level embed to get around this, as a class-level embed does go through the compiler and will result in working code under iOS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\", symbol=\"Symbol1\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine, but I don't want to reference a symbol in the SWF, I want the whole swf (aka reference the main timeline), but the following results in a compiler error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also decompiled the SWF, found the main timeline symbol, and tried this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package\n{\n  import flash.display.MovieClip;\n\n  [Embed(source=\"embed_test.swf\", symbol=\"embed_test_fla.MainTimeline\")]\n   public final dynamic class anim extends MovieClip { };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the compiler insists this symbol doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>Since I have many, many SWF assets, I need a solution that doesn't involve changing my whole workflow (i.e. going into each FLA and making changes).  This should be possible, and if not, this is a workflow problem Adobe should address.</p>\n\n<p>So here I am stuck - regular embeds get the MainTimeline but don't work in iOS, class-level embeds work in iOS and can't access the MainTimeline.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"http://onetacoshort.com/temp/embed_test.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">download my expample project</a> and play with this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flash-cs5","flash-cs4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":112,"score":1,"question_id":12236749,"title":"hit test only on the visible content of MOVIECLIP","body":"<p>I have masked a Bitmap using a shape and have converted this to a movie clip.\nNow only the masked image is inside the movieclip. i have added a mouse click event listener for this movie clip and still the click is taken for the whole movieclip. how do i manage to click only the visible area of the movieclip.</p>\n\n<p>`</p>\n\n<pre><code>//img is a bitmap on stage and s1 is an irregular shape on the stage which is a movieclip\nimg.mask = s1;\n\nvar bmp:Bitmap = new Bitmap(new BitmapData(img.width,img.height,true));\nbmp.bitmapData.draw(img);\nvar n:MovieClip = new MovieClip();\n\n\n\nn.addChild(bmp);\n\naddChild(n);\n\n\ntrace(s1.width + \" \" + s1.height);\ntrace(n.width + \" \" + n.height);\nn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, clicked);\nremoveChild(s1);\nremoveChild(img);\n\nfunction clicked(m:MouseEvent):void\n{\n            trace(n.hitTestPoint(n.mouseX,n.mouseY, false));\n            trace(\"clikckedek kkc kkeke\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>`</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript","inverse-kinematics"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":442,"score":0,"question_id":7697094,"title":"Flash bone tool actionscript 3 RagDoll","body":"<p>I've made a character, and used the bone tool to make it move in runtime.</p>\n\n<p>This works fine, but now I want to add gravity/physics, so I can throw my character and it lands on the ground like a real ragdoll.

All this works fine with following code but as soon as I add a component from inbuilt cs4 components like button or colorpicker to the stage the focus mechanism stops working, how to fix this and what is the cause.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var page:Sprite = new Sprite();\naddChild(page);\npage.tabEnabled = true;\n\nvar shadow:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter(1.0, 90, 0x333333, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3);\nvar filtersArray:Array = [shadow];\n\nvar box1:Sprite = new Sprite();\nbox1.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\nbox1.graphics.drawRect(10, 10, 125, 25);\npage.addChild(box1);\nbox1.filters = filtersArray;\nbox1.tabEnabled = true;\nbox1.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, focusGet);\nbox1.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, focusLost);\n\nvar box2:Sprite = new Sprite();\nbox2.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\nbox2.graphics.drawRect(10, 55, 125, 25);\npage.addChild(box2);\nbox2.filters = filtersArray;\nbox2.tabEnabled = true;\nbox2.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, focusGet);\nbox2.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, focusLost);\n\nvar box3:Sprite = new Sprite();\nbox3.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\nbox3.graphics.drawRect(10, 100, 125, 25);\npage.addChild(box3);\nbox3.filters = filtersArray;\nbox3.tabEnabled = true;\nbox3.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, focusGet);\nbox3.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, focusLost);\n\nvar box4:Sprite = new Sprite();\nbox4.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\nbox4.graphics.drawRect(10, 145, 125, 25);\npage.addChild(box4);\nbox4.filters = filtersArray;\nbox4.tabEnabled = true;\nbox4.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, focusGet);\nbox4.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, focusLost);\n\nvar box5:Sprite = new Sprite();\nbox5.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\nbox5.graphics.drawRect(10, 190, 125, 25);\npage.addChild(box5);\nbox5.filters = filtersArray;\nbox5.tabEnabled = true;\nbox5.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, focusGet);\nbox5.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, focusLost);\n\nfunction focusGet(event:FocusEvent):void\n{\n    var bloom:GlowFilter = new GlowFilter(0xff0000, 1, 6, 6, 1, 3);\n    var filtersArray:Array = [bloom];\n    event.target.filters = filtersArray;\n}\n\nfunction focusLost(event:FocusEvent):void\n{\n    var shadow:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter(1.0, 90, 0x333333, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3);\n    var filtersArray:Array = [shadow];\n    event.target.filters = filtersArray;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT: fixed: once I deactivate focusManager attached to the added component say a colorpicker component named 'colorChoser' the FOCUS_OUT event handler attached to box sprites start working again, as following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>colorChooser.focusManager.deactivate();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also I noted only the FOCUS_OUT handler stopped working previously while FOCUS_IN was working fine.

I found this example online for saving files in AS3:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var file:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(\"Swfs/\" + \"mySwfName\" + \".swf\");\nvar wr:File = new File(file.nativePath);\nvar stream:FileStream = new FileStream();\nstream.open(wr, FileMode.WRITE);\nstream.writeBytes(SWF_FILE_GOES_HERE, 0, SWF_FILE_DATA_LENGTH_GOES_HERE);\nstream.close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is in the <code>writeBytes</code> line.  The sample I found was for saving images to disk, and that line read like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>stream.writeBytes(imageData, 0, imageData.length);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I need to do this for a swf, not an image, and I'm not sure how to get the requisite data from my swf file.  I've searched online for saving swf files, getting data from swf files, etc...  But I haven't found anything.  I need to get the swf's data and data length (I'm assuming this is a number of bytes?).  Has anyone solved this problem before, or have a resource they can point me in the direction of?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Based on @LondonDrugs_MediaServices' comments, I figured out the <code>writeBytes</code> line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>stream.writeBytes(mySwf.loaderInfo.bytes, 0, mySwf.loaderInfo.bytesTotal);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seems to work, in as much as it compiles and runs without errors.  But when I try to grab the file and put it back into a movie clip, I get this error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error #2044: Unhandled IOErrorEvent:. text=Error #2035: URL Not Found.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which implies that the file was not, in fact, saved correctly.  When I print the file locations, however, they seem to be right!  When I save the file to the applicationStorageDirectory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/Users/MyName/Library/Preferences/com.appdir/Local Store/Swfs/mySwName.swf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the filename when I try and load it out of storage and into a movie clip:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/Users/MyName/Library/Preferences/com.appdir/Local Store/Swfs/mySwName.swf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the code I'm using to try and load it back into a movie clip:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var videoFileName:String = \"Swfs/\" + ENVAR.currentVideoSelected + \".swf\";\nvar videoFilePath:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(videoFileName);   \nvar inFileStream:FileStream = new FileStream(); \ntrace(\"[Loading] filepath: \", videoFilePath.nativePath);\ninFileStream.open(videoFilePath, FileMode.READ); \nvar fileContents:String = inFileStream.readUTFBytes(inFileStream.bytesAvailable);   \ninFileStream.close(); \n\nvar req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(videoFilePath.nativePath);\nvar mLoader:Loader = new Loader();\nmLoader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onVideoLoadComplete);\nmLoader.load(req);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And my <code>onVideoLoadComplete</code> function contains these lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myMC:MovieClip = e.target.content as MovieClip;\naddChild(myMC);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I'm getting that error 2044 and it doesn't think the file exists.  Can anyone spot the problem?

I would appreciate any help that you all might be able to offer. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT!!!</p>\n\n<p>As suggested by Will, I attempted to create a timer based network monitoring subsystem. In the IO_ERROR handler on my RSS Ticker, I stop the RSS timer, and start the Network Monitoring Timer. Every 10 seconds, it attempts to download a file from the server. It continues doing so until it works, at which point it turns its own timer off, the restarts the RSS timer.</p>\n\n<p>Should work in theory. Not only that, but it does work if I change it to downloading a website instead of a network file. When using the network file, once it fails, it keeps failing, even after the connection is reestablished. Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>...\n\nfunction ioRSSFeedXMLLoaderErrorHandler(e:Event):void\n{\n    rssTickerTMR.stop();\n    networkMonitorTMR.start();\n\n    trace(\"ioRSSFeedXMLLoaderErrorHandler:\");\n    trace(e.toString());\n\n    ins_rssTitle.text = \"Waiting for connection...\";\n    ins_rssContent.text = \"\";\n\n\n}\n\n// netowrk monitor\nvar networkMonitorXMLLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\nnetworkMonitorXMLLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, networkMonitorXMLLLoaded); \nnetworkMonitorXMLLoader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, networkMonitorXMLLoaderErrorHandler);\n\nvar networkMonitorTMR:Timer = new Timer(10000,0);\nnetworkMonitorTMR.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, checkNetwork);\n\n\nfunction checkNetwork(e:Event = null):void\n{\n    networkMonitorXMLLoader.load(new URLRequest(\"//server/share/file.xml\")); \n}\n\nfunction networkMonitorXMLLoaderErrorHandler(e:Event = null) :void\n{\n    trace(\"Still Off\");\n}\n\nfunction networkMonitorXMLLLoaded(e:Event = null) :void\n{\n    trace(\"Back On\");\n    rssTickerTMR.start();\n    networkMonitorTMR.stop();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I said, if i switch \"//server/shar/file.xml\" to <a href=\"http://www.google.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.ca</a>, it works. When i unplug my ethernet, the network monitor starts, when I plug it back it, it switches back to the RSS... but with my network resource, it just continues to fail...</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","dictionary","clone"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":3,"question_id":12162607,"title":"How to clone a dictionary (and its content)?","body":"<p>I googled some time to find a way to clone a dic, and I found some options, but they didnt work.

Here is my event handler for successfully getting the access token:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    protected function handleTwitterOAuthAccessTokenLoadComplete( evt:Event ):void\n    {\n        _twitterAccessToken     = OAuthUtil.getTokenFromResponse( evt.target.data );\n        trace( \"THE ACCESS TOKEN:\", _twitterAccessToken.key );\n\n\n        //Code to send out a test tweet to logged in Twitter user's account\n        var oauthRequest:OAuthRequest = \n            new OAuthRequest(\n                OAuthRequest.HTTP_MEHTOD_POST, \"https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json\", \n                {},\n                _twitterOAuthConsumer, _twitterAccessToken\n            );\n\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(oauthRequest.requestURL);\n        request.requestHeaders.push( oauthRequest.buildRequest( _twitterOAuthSignature, OAuthRequest.RESULT_TYPE_HEADER) );\n        request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\n        request.data    = new URLVariables( \"scope=hello\" );\n        var urlLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n        urlLoader.addEventListener( Event.COMPLETE, function( evt:Event ):void\n        {\n            trace( evt.target.data );\n        } );\n        urlLoader.addEventListener( IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, function( evt:IOErrorEvent ):void\n        {\n            trace(\"ERROR\");\n            trace( evt.currentTarget.data );\n        } );\n        urlLoader.load( request );\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The error I get from the server is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"error\":\"Could not authenticate with OAuth.\",\"request\":\"\\/statuses\\/update.json\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I checked the header that is being sent, and it matches pretty much what the Twitter OAuth Tool (in the app settings page on Twitter) is telling me it should be.

That works out of the box, but I need them to show additional information when the components are maximized.\nFor that to work I created a very simple method to update the renderers;</p>\n\n<pre><code>private function updateRenderer():void {\n            _itemRenderer.properties = {isFullScreen: _isFullScreen, headerProperties:_headerProperties, visibleColumns:_visibleColumns, optimalColWidth:_optimalColWidth, grid:this.name, fids:_fids};\n            _list.itemRenderer = _itemRenderer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The renderer properties, such as visibleColumns change accordingly and since the renderers will be invalidated automatically during a resize, they can redraw with the new properties.</p>\n\n<p>That is all fine, but unfortunately, new renderers are created with this kind of procedure, instead of simply reusing the existing ones and let them redraw themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to alter this behavior, or does someone know a better way to accomplish a task like this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","background","image-gallery","foreground","bidirectional"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":72,"score":0,"question_id":12180389,"title":"bidirectional gallery with Flashbuilder 4.6 / actionscript 3.0","body":"<p>i want to program a mobile application with flash builder 4.6 (actionscript 3.0) that is able to show a bidirectional image gallary/slideshow. </p>\n\n<p>that means the user should see a \"2-layer-image\" (combination of a front-image and a background-image). </p>\n\n<p>furthermore the user should be able to scroll the front-images horizontally and the background-images vertically. </p>\n\n<p>the images should load dynamically from a server.</p>\n\n<p>is there a way to do so?</p>\n\n<p>I would be thankful for any help.</p>\n\n<p>thanks\ndaniel</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","actionscript"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":1,"question_id":12177394,"title":"How ActionScript Can Get Data From ASHX","body":"<p>With This code I upload selected Files .

This grid is considerably larger than 4x4 one, being 24 x 12 to be exact (288 blocks). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Now what I need</strong> is when my user clicks on this second larger grid I want an output of their designed shape to be added to the stage as a brand new MovieClip.</p>\n\n<p>But importantly the shape needs to be cropped down. For example if the user made a square shape on the first grid by selecting blocks 2,3,6,7; I don’t want a 16 block MovieClip (92x92 pixels, based on my 23x23 pixel blocks) being added to the bigger grid with four blocks shaded a different colour, I want a 4 block, squared shape (46 x 46 pixels, based on my 23x23 blocks) to be added, from the top-left grid square you select on the second grid.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally I’d like to create my user’s plotted shape programmatically using the Shape Drawing tool and do this within a function, so I can then run the function each time the user enters the second grid area and update the user’s shape, should the user had gone back and amended it in the first grid. This would also give me the scope to also change the shape colour prior to adding the child of it to my stage, which is another area of functionality I need and another reason why I’d like to do this shape programmatically.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine capturing the x/y co-ordinates of the blocks from the first grid in a further array and subsequently searching through that array to find the first block instance and then draw the shape from this point, could be the way forward but that is as far as my thinking has taken me.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas or suggested reading on how to do this would be very welcome. Many Thanks. </p>\n"}]}
