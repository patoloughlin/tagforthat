This personally doesn't bother me, or 99% percent of users, but in the past (for doing something similar) I've been contacted by a user who was concerned about their page invalidating with a particular DocType due to the plugin markup. I can't recall entirely why this DocType was required (lost the email), but I think it may have had something to do with some HTTPS payment pages and security validation. I actually think this may have tied in with one of the plugin links not being HTTPS as well. Really vague, I know.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that kind-of poses another question.

Apply styles to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> programmatically</h2>\n\n<p>Here I tried listening for 'DOMNodeInserted' and when an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag was inserted into the DOM, I queried the current <code>fontName</code>, <code>fontSize</code>, and <code>foreColor</code> commands and applied them as an inline style on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>textarea.addEventListener('DOMNodeInserted', function (evt) {\n    if (evt.target.nodeName === 'LI') {\n        evt.target.style.color = queryCommandValue('foreColor');\n        evt.target.style.fontFamily = queryCommandValue('fontName');\n        evt.target.style.fontSize = queryCommandValue('fontSize');\n    }\n}, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even when doing this, as soon as you begin typing in the list item, the browser tries to be \"smart\" and strips the styles from the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, placing them into a <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>) tag.  :(</p>\n\n<h2>2. Create a rule for the styles to be inserted into the StyleSheet</h2>\n\n<p>Based off the attempt above, instead of writing the styles inline, I created a rule for them, gave the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> node an ID, and inserted the rule into the stylesheet. Now the rule would govern the style of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, and I could use the CSSOM to continually update any particular <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s styles.</p>\n\n<p>This seemed to work very well (with a few bugs to solve for), however, it completely breaks the contentEditable undo stack. Since the undo command is only tied to <code>textContent</code> and other formatting commands, there is no way to \"undo\" the styles you are setting in the stylesheet. (At least not very intuitively, I've thought about how this might be done...)</p>\n\n<h2>3. Watch for changes in the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s attributes and retain them</h2>\n\n<p>For this attempt, I made use of the newly-available MutationObserver <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutationobserve\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutationobserver</a> available in DOM level 4. This observer can watch for changes in a node's attributes, which will be passed back in a MutationRecord. It can even hold the previous attribute values, including <code>style</code> values, so I could find out what was being removed and re-apply it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var observer = new WebKitMutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n    mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {\n        if (mutation.target.nodeName === 'LI') {\n            ...\n        }\n    })\n});\n\nobserver.observe(document, {\n    attributes: true,\n    subtree: true,\n    attributeOldValue: true\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This still suffers from lack of undo support. You will undo other formatting changes but the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s will keep their styles.</p>\n\n<p>Any novel ideas out there? Modern-browser only solutions welcomed as well. I'm aware that I could format my own HTML to use for lists but I'm trying to see if this can be done using the standard <code>insertOrderedList</code> and <code>insertUnorderedList</code> commands which use real list tags. </p>\n\n<h2>** Update Nov 7 2012 **</h2>\n\n<p>Doesn't look like anyone has solved this yet, here is an example JSFiddle to see what I'm describing: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/8LyZR/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/8LyZR/</a>.

I thought this was a recommended way to create a game loop.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Frame Test&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"/css/bootstrap.css\" media=\"all\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js\"\n        type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/jquery.hotkeys.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/key_status.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/util.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/sprite.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;button id=\"button1\"&gt;\n        Toggle Loop&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;h1 id=\"frameCount\"&gt;\n        Game Loop Test&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;canvas id=\"gameCanvas\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support canvas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/canvas&gt;\n    &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n\n\n\n        // demo code used for playing around with javascript-canvas animations\n        var frameCount = 0;\n        var drawingCanvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');\n        // Check the element is in the DOM and the browser supports canvas\n        if (drawingCanvas.getContext) {\n            var context = drawingCanvas.getContext('2d');\n            var x = 100;\n            var y = 100;\n            var right = true;\n            context.strokeStyle = \"#000000\";\n            context.fillStyle = \"Green\";\n            context.beginPath();\n            context.arc(x, y, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);\n            context.closePath();\n            context.stroke();\n            context.fill();\n\n        }\n\n\n\n        function Timer(settings) {\n            this.settings = settings;\n            this.timer = null;\n            this.on = false;  //Bool that represents if the timer is running or stoped\n            this.fps = settings.fps || 30;  //Target frames per second value\n            this.interval = Math.floor(1000 / 30);\n            this.timeInit = null;  //Initial time taken when start is called\n\n            return this;\n        }\n\n        Timer.prototype =\n            {\n                run: function () {\n                    var $this = this;\n\n                    this.settings.run();\n                    this.timeInit += this.interval;\n\n                    this.timer = setTimeout(\n                function () { $this.run() },\n                this.timeInit - (new Date).getTime()\n            );\n                },\n\n                start: function () {\n                    if (this.timer == null) {\n                        this.timeInit = (new Date).getTime();\n                        this.run();\n                        this.on = true;\n                    }\n                },\n\n                stop: function () {\n                    clearTimeout(this.timer);\n                    this.timer = null;\n                    this.on = false;\n                },\n\n                toggle: function () {\n\n                    if (this.on) { this.stop(); }\n                    else { this.start(); }\n                }\n            }\n\n        var timer = new Timer({\n            fps: 30,\n            run: function () {\n                //---------------------------------------------run game code here------------------------------------------------------\n                //Currently Chorme is playing a catch up game with the frames to be drawn when the user leaves the browser window and then returns\n                //A simple canvas animation is drawn here to try and figure out how to solve this issue.

However, when I resize the window it's very sluggish. I've temporarily gotten around this by putting in a throttler, which just sets a timer to avoid firing the above functions too quickly. This helps slightly, but will keep the background image in place (displaying open solid background areas around the image) until the throttler timer kicks in and fires the methods - resizing the canvas/image and applying the filter. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a faster way? I've read about using Typed Arrays/Bitwise for pixel manipulation loops, but it seems that support is horrible for this. I've also looked into CSS3 filters to accomplish the same thing, but again, support is horrible. So, would this be the only approach to full-screen background image filters with \"modern browser\" compatibility?</p></li>\n<li><p>The updateCanvas method is creating a new image object each time, I'm thinking that this might be a bottleneck, but am unsure, and also unsure of how to get around it?</p></li>\n<li><p>I've read others using a separate canvas as a buffer? Would this actually increase performance in my situation? </p></li>\n<li><p>I'm really thinking there's a major logic issue in my code somewhere. It just doesn't make sense to me that I would need to loop through all of the pixel information more than once, but this is the only way I've gotten it to work. Isn't there a way I can draw it/apply the filter once, then on resize, just adjust the dimensions without having to redraw/reloop/reapply the filter? I would think that it would maintain the filtered image, but if I remove the call to the canvasFilter method on window resize, it completely removes the filter effect. </p></li>\n<li><p>I've yet to use memoization techniques as I've never quite understood it, and never quite understand where/when to use it. But, essentially, if I have a function that is returning the same results again and again (such as the canvasFilter method) can I memoize to increase performance - or would it be difference because it's pulling different pixel information after the window has resized?</p></li>\n<li><p>I've also heard that a webGL render might help with this? Might be way off as I don't know anything about webGL.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So sorry for the loooonng question, but hopefully this covers some topics that others can benefit from as well. Any suggestions/tips would be much appreciated.

This seems incredibly short-sighted since it will only be a useful validator when your database fields are signed floating point numbers (for unsigned ints you'll have to fall back to \"pattern\" validation and thus loose extra features like the up and down arrows for browsers that support it).

Setting the step to 1 is not the answer since it doesn't restrict the input. You can still type a negative floating point number into the textbox. Also, I am aware of pattern validation (I mentioned it in my original post), but that was not part of the question. I wanted to know if HTML5 allowed restricting an input of type \"number\" to positive integer values. To this question the answer, it seems, would be \"no, it does not\". I didn't want to use pattern validation because this causes some drawbacks when using jQuery Tools validation, but it now seems that the specification doesn't allow for a cleaner way to do this. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html5","jsf","canvas","graph"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":270,"score":2,"question_id":10621091,"title":"JSF for drawing graphs (not a chart, but a DAG) in HTML5","body":"<p>I want to draw some nodes (might be substituted by small thumbnails) and connect them with lines.

We wanted to come up with an <strong>ideal workflow</strong> to prepare, publish, and run high-quality animated graphics in the browser. So ideally have a single source of animation data that would work for small smartphone screens, tablets, retina displays, and desktop browsers.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, (vector-based) SVG should be ideal for that, but since SVG is not usually used that much - we decided to test it out. The idea was not to use SMIL SVG (so no SVG-based animation) but instead create an animation sprite-sheet (as you normally would with raster data PNG/JPG) but do this with pure vectors i.e. SVG. Its was a bit bigger but if it works this - it would work even with something thats even more optimized.</p>\n\n<p>Plus frame-by-frame vector animation could do great things for our workflow - it would allow us to use the Flash editor to do the animations and then export them to SVG sprite sheets.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <strong>the result works surprisingly well</strong> but also fails in some areas (please note for test purposes we only worked with Webkit-based browsers i.e. Safari, Chrome, mobile Safari on iOS, and Android ICS).</p>\n\n<p>In CSS it's pretty easy to trigger hardware acceleration for a sprite sheet like this (at least in modern browsers with keyframes and steps) - you simply do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>background-image: url(my.svg);\n-webkit-animation: walk 1s steps(12, end) infinite; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to call keyframe-based animation shown here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes walk {\n    from { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); }\n    to { -webkit-transform: translate3d(-100%, 0, 0); }          \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the use of translate3d should let GPU kick in and the entire thing should be hardware accelerated in iOS mobile Safari and Android ICS browser.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly enough considering that it's kind of a brute-force technique and a fairly large vector animation (600x600px for the test) - the whole thing flies. But its not perfect - it flickers in Safari before taking off. And in the ICS browser its flickering all the time so its not really usable.</p>\n\n<p>So we tried the usual tricks to get rid of flickering such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);    \n-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\n-webkit-perspective: 1000;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that didn't work. So then we tried rasterizing SVG dynamically in memory and using it as a texture with <em>-webkit-transform: scale3d(1, 1, 0)</em> but that didn't help ether. </p>\n\n<p>Finally we just replaced the SVG with a rendered out PNG/JPG sprite sheet of the same size thinking the complex vectors are just too much for the browser - but guess what? Its the same issue - so its not SVG rendering at all - <strong>its a browser drawing issue.</strong> A further proof of that is if we slow the animation down to 1FPS - flickering still persists.</p>\n\n<p>Is the image just too big for GPU? Have we reached the performance limit of what you're able to comfortably draw/animate in the browser (mobile in particular)?</p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate ideas/hacks on how to potentially get rid of the flickering (especially since its performing sooo fast). Its just a promising technique - hight performance browser animation that adapts to different screen sizes - <strong>the HTML5 Holy Grail</strong> ;)</p>\n\n<p>With a few optimizations such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;svg preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMax slice\" viewBox=\"0 0 600 50\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and some CSS magic we're able to have the SVG adapt to its container perfectly and change its size from a single CSS class. It really would work wonders - but alas the flickering.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway - please <strong>read more about it here</strong> (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/INMKZT\">http://bit.ly/INMKZT</a>) where you're also able to <strong>try it out</strong>. </p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","favicon","rel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":1,"question_id":13211206,"title":"HTML5 `<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" />`","body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#attr-hyperlink-rel\" rel=\"nofollow\">WHATWG document</a> for HTML5 says that the <code>rel</code> attribute must contain values that are space-separated, and then it gives a table of allowed values.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The attribue's value must be a set of space-separated tokens.

Similarly for the  tag, can the external file be an .html file(I don't like the idea of reloading all the header information with .css calls) or should it be .php?  </p>\n\n<p>Within the index.html file I have tried the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;object id=\"footerArea\" width=\"100%\" height=\"20%\" \n  type=\"text/html\" data=\"footer.html\"&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php include 'footer.php' ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Neither of these seem to work for me.</p>\n\n<p>In case you are wondering...  Here is the code for my footer I am trying to inject with sample data to make it shorter and easier to read:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"footer box\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"f-right t-right\"&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;www.mysite.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n  Address: Medford, OR&lt;br /&gt;\n  Phone: (541) 555-5555\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"f-left\"&gt;\n Copyright &amp;copy;&amp;nbsp;2011 &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;My Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"f-left\" style=\"margin-left:20px;\"&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"http://sampleurl.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n  &lt;img style=\"border:0;width:88px;height:31px\"\n   src=\"http://sampleurl.com\"\n   alt=\"Valid CSS3!\" /&gt;\n &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"f-left\" style=\"margin-left:20px;\"&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"http://sampleurl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n &lt;img src=\"http://sample.png\" width=\"228\" height=\"50\" alt=\"sample alt\" title=\"sample title\"&gt;\n &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please excuse my formatting.

I don't have a preference for Canvas or SVG yet, that is why I included all of the above projects.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above information, which framework is the right tool for building this game?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","html5","mobile-safari"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":1835,"score":2,"question_id":8409760,"title":"Mobile Safari - Article, text and images blurry on iPhone","body":"<p>So, my site looks blurry on Mobile Safari.

I will use html5 window history push state to change the url to the actual location we will be navigating to.  The only thing I haven't been able to find is to do the actual animation.  I have looked into carousels, but none of them quite do what I want.  Is there an existing library that handles just the animation of page transition, having that slight recoil bounce effect?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  I just found jquery.animate which I think might do the trick.</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","css3","css-transitions"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":18,"score":0,"question_id":13200796,"title":"css3 corners with different angles and shapes","body":"<p>On my [DEMO][1] below, I've been busy developing all the styles. but not able to do it properly only using css3.\nHave you got a quick or nice way to do it only in CSS3?

Cant seem to figure this one out. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for any help you can offer.. </p>\n\n<p>--- CODE FOR HTML ---</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Canvas - Triangle experiment&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"js/drawShapes.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;style&gt;\n        * { margin: 0; }\n        * { padding: 0; }\n\n        span.markings {\n            position: absolute;\n        }\n\n        div.drawingArea {\n            margin: 50px 0 0 10px;\n            padding: 0;\n            width: 500px;\n            height: 500px;\n            position: relative;\n            background: #ccc;\n        }\n        .coords { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 200px; }\n        .coords p { position: relative; }\n        .xcoord, .ycoord {  font-weight: bold; color: red; }\n        #myCanvas { background: #eee; }\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"coords\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;X: &lt;span class=\"xcoord\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y: &lt;span class=\"ycoord\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"drawingArea\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"markings A\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"markings B\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"markings C\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"410\" height=\"410\"&gt;Your browser does not have support for Canvas.

I'm using some videos as backgrounds inside a couple of slides. While I've tried many plugins, some worked erratically with jScrollPane so I ended up using \"simpleVideo jQuery plugin\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/markupboy/simpleVideo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/markupboy/simpleVideo</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The plugin uses the video tag to play everything. I'm including a video tag inside every page, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            &lt;div class=\"rsImg page\" id=\"page1\"&gt;\n\n                &lt;video poster=\"video/poster.png\" id=\"video-intro\"&gt;\n                    &lt;source src=\"video/trailer_480p.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\"&gt;\n                    &lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"&gt;\n                &lt;/video&gt;\n\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;!-- END OF PAGE 1--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Video plays and behaves correctly, it's nice.</p>\n\n<p>But as I add more slides, I'm getting worried about memory usage and slowness in the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>I have a function that listens for a \"SlideChange\" event, so destroying the video wouldn't be much of a problem once the slide changes, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  poshSlider.ev.on('rsAfterSlideChange', function() {\nif(poshSlider.currSlideId+1!=1)\n{\n  $('#video-intro').trigger('stop');\n  $('video').empty().remove();\n} else {\n  $('#page1').append('&lt;video poster=\"video/poster.png\" id=\"video-intro\"&gt;&lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/ogg\"&gt;&lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;');\n  $('#video-intro').simpleVideo();\n  $('#video-intro').trigger('play');\n}\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I've tried with emptying and removing the whole div, video tag and such. Then, to reinitialize the video I thought of appending the same code in the same place, but it doesn't work as expected and I don't know if it's a good way when it comes to taking care of memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p>What would be a way of loading and unloading videos considering my approach?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was using \"append\" instead of \"html\". My code now works like this, I just need to look after memory increases and some kind of garbage collection.

In HTML5, each section can have its own heading element so it is okay to have more than one <code>h1</code>. I've seen a Wordpress theme framework, <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/2012/02/21/getting-started-with-the-underscores-theme/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"underscores\"</a>, which seem to apply this in the fullest.</p>\n\n<p>However, this may seem to pose problem for older browsers (yet to support HTML5) in defining the site structure/document outline.

Matt Cutts also imply that multiple <code>h1</code> is not too good for SEO.</p>\n\n<p>However,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I previously never paid serious attention to site structure/document outline.

Ideally I'd use a worker to spawn subworkers but this does not have as wide of a support as workers alone. So since modern browsers support from 4-8 (mobile even more) parallel http connections per domain - I was wondering if I could just open 8 workers and use them for loading/crunching/encoding (with a queue function in my main thread delegating files to load). Are there possibly any performance considerations here?</p>\n\n<p>I guess this is an architecture question - how many workers can you open without impacting stability? I guess system developers know more about spawning threads than just poor web developers ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Another question - since my app is performance sensitive and workers are potentially initialising quite a bit of code at start I was thinking that instead of creating/destroying workers dynamically I would just create 6 of them at application start and keep them \"open\" and running during the entire lifespan of my app. They're not crunching data all the time - just from time to time when XHR requests/encoding is needed - so keeping them open when they're not doing anything should not make much difference right? Or would extra unused threads still impact the main application thread (or browser) somehow?</p>\n"},{"tags":["forms","html5","tornado"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13160340,"title":"how to make that the server trust client side validation?","body":"<p>i found sometimes -said- that <em>an application must have two validation: client side and server side</em>.</p>\n\n<p>my question: is there any way to make a kind of trusting message that is crypted, so only the server and client will understand, so like that the server will avoid form verification, because when i've added regex to validation in python, this increased my application reponse time!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","image","html5","html5-canvas","kineticjs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":0,"question_id":13139671,"title":"Resizing the images while keeping proportion using kinetic js canvas","body":"<p>I'm using this in my app:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images/</a></p>\n\n<p>have use anchors for resizing the image ..</p>\n\n<p>What I want is to resize the image and keep its ratio maintained.\nI don't want it to stretch \nI'm able to achieve that using this peace of code.:..</p>\n\n<pre><code>  if(width) {\n        image.setSize(width);\n      }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this is screwing up the anchors ..\nAnyone ever tried something like this..</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","html5","ipad"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":23,"score":-2,"question_id":13158016,"title":"Access camera from browser without using flash/silverlight","body":"<p>I want to access camera from browser.

I can't change the volume, nor can I send text messages automatically (although I can with Android OS). So, if I wanted to make my phone turn to silent with no vibrate between 9pm and 7am Monday - Sunday... I can't.</p>\n\n<p>If I wanted to schedule a text at a later date, I can't - all I can do is have the message populated, ready for me to send.</p>\n\n<p>And why? It makes little sense to limit these. OK, it makes some sense in regards to stopping developers having access to sending text messages (to protect the consumer from malicious dudes (especially if there is a cost of the text involved))... but no! This is what internet security does - or the UAC in Windows... It allows users to set permissions. A program should try to send a text, the OS detect it and a new rule is created to always allow / deny (depending on user input) (with a  nice little remember my preference setting). </p>\n\n<p>Any way, sorry for the rant but these 2 features are vital for the style of apps I've been asked to create.

Maybe caching in network routers works better with smaller file sizes or whatever?    </p>\n\n<p>So my question boils down to whether it is a good idea to inline <em>everything</em> when making singlepage mobile web apps?</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","html5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13132377,"title":"Group an image with text in an un-word-wrappable group in HTML5","body":"<p>In HTML, is it possible to have a group of an image and text that cannot be broken by word wrapping? i.e. would either be rendered together on one line, or wrap together to the next?</p>\n\n<p>This can be done with words, by using <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> but I want to add a small, letter sized icon to this group.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;\n  Some some normal, wrappable text \n  &lt;span class=\"unbreakable\"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img src=\"logo.png\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nsbp;&lt;a&gt;Product&amp;nbsp;Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NB. for brevity I have removed the attributes from the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, it is possible for the \"logo.png\" image to appear on one line, and \"Product Name\" on the next.</p>\n\n<p>This code is part of a resizable element, sometimes it will be capable of being rendered on 1 line, others it will need to, so I don't want to force a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for the times it is not needed.</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net-mvc","html5","video"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13132761,"title":"object tag not work in the chrome browser","body":"<p>i am using the following code to play video of different extension like(avi,wmv,flv,mp4) in the browser . with the following code only two file extension(avi,wmv) run only in intenet explore and mozilla but not in the chrome...\\\nhere my question is what is reason it not work in chrome and is there method to run above mention video in all browser.i tried many thing but not succeed \nIs there any jquery plugin to use this.\nplease help me ....\nThanks in advance</p>\n\n<pre><code>           &lt;object id=\"MediaPlayer1\" CLASSID=\"CLSID:22d6f312-b0f6-11d0-94ab-0080c74c7e95\" codebase=\"http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/mplayer/en/nsmp2inf.cab#Version=5,1,52,701\"\nstandby=\"Loading Microsoft Windows® Media Player components...\" type=\"application/x-oleobject\" width=\"262\" height=\"160\"&gt;\n\n          &lt;param name=\"src\" value=\"C:\\New folder\\Wildlife.wmv\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;param name=\"src\" value=\"flash_ad.swf\"&gt;\n\n&lt;param name=\"animationatStart\" value=\"true\"&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"transparentatStart\" value=\"true\"&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"showControls\" value=\"true\"&gt;\n&lt;param name=\"Volume\" value=\"-450\"&gt;\n&lt;embed type=\"application/x-mplayer2\" pluginspage=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/MediaPlayer/\" src=\"C:\\New folder\\Wildlife.wmv\" name=\"MediaPlayer1\" width=262 height=160 autostart=0 showcontrols=1 volume=-450&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;  \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","css","html5","animation","canvas"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":63,"score":0,"question_id":13129616,"title":"HTML5 Canvas & javascript prize wheel","body":"<p>I am having trouble trying to implement a \"prize wheel,\" using canvas.

Works great in all IOS devices as they have native web-socket support, and works fairly consistently in android devices when you have flash installed. Now, Android ICS 4.03 and above claims to support native web-sockets. Window.WebSocket is defined, but I'm having no luck opening the socket. Does anyone know why?

To do this you have to change the web-socket-js code to check if it is an android client. then, before using the web-socket, try to connect to a port on the local machine. Then check the protocol property of the websocket. If this is defined, then you are good to go with native, otherwise fall back to flash.

Right now, I'm working on my first HTML5 program on my own, and it's a really simple top down shooter. Right now, I've got the code written so that a ship appears on the screen that you can move side to side. However, now I'm trying to create a new object to draw called bullet. I kind of copied the code from the ship, but I can't get it to work. So far, here is the code. It's fairly small, so you can understand the ship. Here's the ship object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function ship() {\n    this.width = 100;\n    this.height = 75;\n    this.drawX = gameWidth/2 - this.width/2;\n    this.drawY = gameHeight - this.height - 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do draw that, I use this function: </p>\n\n<pre><code>ship.prototype.draw = function() {\n    clearCtx(ctxPlayer);\n    var srcX;\n    var srcY;\n    if(isRightKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 75;\n    } else if (isLeftKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 153;\n    } else {\n        srcX= 0;\n        srcY = 0;\n    }\n\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,srcX,srcY,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That stuff towards the top only changes the source of the image because the image is different if it's moving one way or another. Anyway, here's the bullet object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function BulletGreen() {\n    var drawX = 0;\n    var drawY = 0;\n    var height = 33;\n    var width = 9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it's pretty similar. Now, here's the code I use to draw it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BulletGreen.prototype.draw = function drawBulletsGreen() {\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,350,0,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this just doesn't seem to work when I use the command in the console. It returns no errors but doesn't seem to change the canvas at all. However, doing something like </p>\n\n<pre><code>ctxBullet.drawImage(sprites,0,0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will draw out the sprite sheet onto the canvas. I apologize if this sort of question isn't welcome here, but I'm just out of ideas!

In particular, a single-page web application should support the browser history, including the back and forward buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Most frameworks for single-page web applications do support the browser history. But they do not seem to emulate one crucial thing: When I am on, say, page 1 of a traditional web application and fill in a form field, navigate away to page 2 of the application and then click the back button, the browser will restore my input.</p>\n\n<p>With a single-page web application, one of two things usually happens: Either the form field of page 1 is still part of the DOM (but hidden) on page 2 (or at least part of a Javascript data structure), so that the application may show me the filled-in form field again after navigating back, or the form field is created anew everytime I visit page 1 (either through direct navigation or by pressing the back button). In the latter case, my former input is not restored.</p>\n\n<p>It seems clear that the former is the better. But even this solution isn't perfect: In a tradition web application, each history entry has its own cached values of form fields, even if the history contains the previously mentioned page 1 several times. The single-page application which doesn't recreate the form fields on every in-application navigation, however, caches only a single value for every form field.</p>\n\n<p>One idea to solve this problem and making single-page web applications better, would be to store the values of the form fields in the <em>data</em> attribute of the pushState and replaceState methods of the HTML5 history interface to have them stored along the other history information.

And the other tiles are working just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for collision detection and tile drawing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Function that allows you to draw a tile\nfunction drawTile(type, x, y, collision){\n    var tileImg = new Image();\n    tileImg.onload = function(){\n        ctx.drawImage(tileImg, x, y)\n    };\n    tileImg.src = \"images/\" + type + \".png\";\n\n    if (collision){\n        //Worst collision detection ever.\n        if((player_x + player_width == x) &amp;&amp; (player_y + player_height &gt; y)){\n            canMoveRight = false;\n        }else if((player_x == x + 32) &amp;&amp; (player_y + player_height &gt; y)){\n            canMoveLeft = false;\n        }else if((player_y + player_height &gt; y) &amp;&amp; (player_x + player_width &gt;= x) &amp;&amp; (player_x + player_width &lt;= x + 64)){\n            player_y = y - player_height;\n        }else{\n            canMoveRight = true;\n            canMoveLeft = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n//Draw the map\nfunction drawMap(){\n    drawTile(\"block\", 96, 208, true);\n    drawTile(\"block\", 128, 208, true);\n    drawTile(\"block\", 128, 176, true);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the collision detection code kinda sucks. So it also would be good if you showed me better ways of making it.</p>\n\n<p>Just say if you need to know something. :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","audio","html5-audio"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13078889,"title":"Working with AudioContext with a source from audio tag","body":"<p>I'm building a music player and I'd like to add a pulsation effect depending on the track currently played. </p>\n\n<p>Here some examples of what I'd want:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.htmlfivewow.com/demos/hal/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.htmlfivewow.com/demos/hal/index.html</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/360-player/canvas-visualization.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/360-player/canvas-visualization.html</a></p>\n\n<p>My problem is that in the first example, sound is loaded via xhr, and in the second it uses flash. </p>\n\n<p>I'd want to be able to get the sound that I want to analyze from the audio tag.</p>\n\n<p>I'm afraid it could not be possible, it would cause a big lack of security because we could load web pages instead of sound and then analyse it.

Right now, I'm working on my first HTML5 program on my own, and it's a really simple top down shooter. Right now, I've got the code written so that a ship appears on the screen that you can move side to side. However, now I'm trying to create a new object to draw called bullet. I kind of copied the code from the ship, but I can't get it to work. So far, here is the code. It's fairly small, so you can understand the ship. Here's the ship object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function ship() {\n    this.width = 100;\n    this.height = 75;\n    this.drawX = gameWidth/2 - this.width/2;\n    this.drawY = gameHeight - this.height - 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do draw that, I use this function: </p>\n\n<pre><code>ship.prototype.draw = function() {\n    clearCtx(ctxPlayer);\n    var srcX;\n    var srcY;\n    if(isRightKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 75;\n    } else if (isLeftKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 153;\n    } else {\n        srcX= 0;\n        srcY = 0;\n    }\n\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,srcX,srcY,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That stuff towards the top only changes the source of the image because the image is different if it's moving one way or another. Anyway, here's the bullet object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function BulletGreen() {\n    var drawX = 0;\n    var drawY = 0;\n    var height = 33;\n    var width = 9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it's pretty similar. Now, here's the code I use to draw it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BulletGreen.prototype.draw = function drawBulletsGreen() {\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,350,0,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this just doesn't seem to work when I use the command in the console. It returns no errors but doesn't seem to change the canvas at all. However, doing something like </p>\n\n<pre><code>ctxBullet.drawImage(sprites,0,0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will draw out the sprite sheet onto the canvas. I apologize if this sort of question isn't welcome here, but I'm just out of ideas!

Does anyone have a doc on this?</p>\n\n<p>I see there is a list on the <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/named-character-references.html#named-character-references\">WHATWG</a> spec but I'm not sure if it affects files served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. By any means the two mentioned trigger errors in both Chromium nightly and FF 3.6.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","angularjs","angular"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":3,"question_id":13076536,"title":"Why is an input of type=\"number\" not showing updates to its bound value?","body":"<p>A set of HTML input controls are bound to testVar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-app&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=\"TestCtrl\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"range\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;button ng-click=\"testVar = 5\"&gt;set to 5&lt;/button&gt;              \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Initially all the input controls show this value as expected, but the type=\"number\" input becomes blank when testVar is changed via the type=\"range\" or type=\"text\" inputs.

However, I can't seem to figure out how to get drag and drop to work in Safari, while it works perfectly in Chrome and Firefox. More precisely, it seems that drop event does not fire in Safari, when you try to drag an image inside the website into the drop area. At the same time it does fire when you drag and drop a file from desktop.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not really sure, but I'm pretty certain that when I tried the same script at work (where I have Safari 5.0.2 etc), it fired the drop event (going to check it tomorrow to be sure) and gave me the FileReader-related errors that were expected. But when I just installed Safari 5.1 on my own PC, I only get dragover, enter and leave events (and drop too if the file was dragged into the browser).</p>\n\n<p>I've been Googling for some time now and don't seem to find a single example of drag and drop that actually works in Safari 5.1. Even Safari's <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Tasks/DragAndDrop.html\">dev-centre's sample</a> doesn't work, let alone <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/drag\">html5demo.com 1</a> and <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/drag-anything\">html5demo.com 2</a>. This leads me to think whether the Safari has a bug, or maybe they have implemented something mandatory that isn't reflected in the dev-centre (last updated in 2009).</p>\n\n<p>The script I'm trying to fix is at <a href=\"http://www.ut.ee/~vahurr/memebuilder\">my site</a> (sorry guys, no problem specific code to post, as it seems to be broken elsewhere too).</p>\n\n<p>PS! I might have introduced some bugs into my own site while desperately trying to fix the drag and drop in Safari, but I'm too tired to fix them right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Just confirmed at work that the drop event does fire in Safari 5.0.2 on Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Also confirmed that everything works perfectly fine with Safari 5.0.6 on Win 7, the same computer that fails with 5.1</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","iis6","video-streaming","mime-types"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":146,"score":0,"question_id":11401753,"title":"IIS 6.0 loses MIME type after I set it","body":"<p>I'm hosting a few videos on an IIS server running version 6.0 and I have set my MIME types up properly (.mp4, video/mp4), however when I try and stream those videos it consistently tells me that the MIME types aren't supported. </p>\n\n<p>Since I'm running IIS I don't think I need to worry about .htaccess but I could be wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Any idea how I could be losing the MIME information?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","image","html5","canvas","game-engine"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":13077181,"title":"HTML5 - How to just draw the finished canvas/image","body":"<p>I'm making a little game with HTML5 and MooTools and I have performance problems on firefox.

I am not positive, but this solution only seems to work if Internet Explorer is version 9 or greater, which is not ideal, but definitely better than no support at all. I also do not think that I can do this onload like they did seeing I will be populating my draggable objects from a database, so onload will probably have fired before the items have been placed into the dropzone. <a href=\"http://marakana.com/s/html5_drag_n_drop_api,1071/samples/try2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://marakana.com/s/html5_drag_n_drop_api,1071/samples/try2.htm</a> Specifically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(myDiv.dragDrop){\n    myDiv.onselectstart=function(){this.dragDrop();return false};\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not trying to attain 100% browser compatibility, but I would like to get Internet Explorer and Firefox.

This is not my most pressing concern, but if you did happen to see a fix that would be great!(sorting only works on the upper dropzone) I do not want to use jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Basic drag and drop example&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;style&gt;\n    @CHARSET \"UTF-8\";\ntable.draggable-word {\n    background-color: red;\n    padding: 0px;\n    border: 1px solid green;\n    -webkit-touch-callout: none;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -khtml-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    -ms-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    border-spacing: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n    line-height: 1;\n    width: 100%;\n    height:50px;\n}\n\n.drop-div {\n    width: 150px;\n    height: 150px;\n    border: 3px solid #224163;\n    background-color: #AABACC;\n    margin-top: 15px;\n    text-align: center;\n    overflow: auto;\n}\n\n[draggable=true] {\n    cursor: default;\n    margin-top: 0px;\n    margin-bottom: 0px;\n    margin-top: 0px;\n}\n\ntable {\n     border-color: #600;\n    border-width: 0 0 1px 1px;\n    border-style: solid;\n}\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n\nvar user =\"\";\nvar multiples = false;\nvar data;\n\nfunction dragStartHandler(event,id) {\n    event.dataTransfer.setData('Object', event.target.id);\n    user = id;\n    multiples = true;\n     data = event.dataTransfer.getData('Object');\n    //multipleDrag(data,\"false\");\n\n}\nfunction dropHandler(event) {\n    preventDefaults(event);\n    if (!event.target) {\n        alert('we');\n        event.target = event.srcElement\n    }\n    data = event.dataTransfer.getData('Object');\n    event.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));\n    document.getElementById(data).selectedIndex = -1;\n    //alert(user);\n\n\n\n}\nfunction dragOverHandler(event) {\n    preventDefaults(event);\n}\n\nfunction preventDefaults(event) {\n    if (event.preventDefault) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n    }\n\n    try {\n        event.returnValue = false;\n    }\n    catch (exception) {}\n}\n\n\nfunction dragend(event) {\n//    multipleDrag(data,\"true\");\n\n}\n\nfunction multipleDrag(data,state){\n    document.getElementById(data).setAttribute(\"draggable\", state);\n}\n\nfunction sort(uList)\n{\n    var listItem = document.getElementById(uList).getElementsByTagName('td');\n    var listLength = listItem.length;\n    var list = [];\n\n    for(var i=0;

Again, this works perfectly when I only have one finger on the screen/one joystick in use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            if( ig.ua.mobile ) {\n            // ROTATION\n            if (ig.game.joystick1.touchStart.x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; ig.game.joystick1.touchStart.x &lt; ig.system.width/2) {\n                if (Math.abs(ig.game.joystick1.delta.x) &gt;= 50 || Math.abs(ig.game.joystick1.delta.y) &gt;= 50) {\n                    this.joystickAngle = ig.game.Controller.toDegrees(ig.game.Controller.joystickAngle());\n                    if (this.angle &gt; this.joystickAngle + 20) {\n                        this.angle -= this.turnSpeed * ig.system.tick;\n                    }\n\n                    else if (this.angle &lt; this.joystickAngle - 20) {\n                        this.angle += this.turnSpeed * ig.system.tick;\n                    }\n\n                    else {\n                        this.angle = this.joystickAngle;\n                    }\n                } \n            }\n\n            // THRUST\n            if (ig.game.joystick2.touchStart.x &gt; ig.system.width / 2) {\n                if (ig.game.joystick2.delta.y &lt;= -50) {\n                    this.accel.x = Math.cos(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*this.thrust;\n                    this.accel.y = (Math.sin(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*this.thrust);\n                    this.fuel -= 0.1;\n                }\n\n                else if (ig.game.joystick2.delta.y &gt;= 50) {\n                    this.accel.x = Math.cos(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*-this.thrust;\n                    this.accel.y = (Math.sin(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*-this.thrust);\n                    this.fuel -= 0.1;\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            else {\n                this.accel.x = 0;\n                this.accel.y = 0;\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As soon as I place a second finger on the screen, however, the first joystick becomes overwritten. I can rotate and then move or move and then rotate and it works fine, but I need to do both at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>I found out that touchStart.x and touchStart.y seems to be being set for both joysticks when I tap to use the other stick and not just the relevant joystick1 or joystick2, even though in the plugin code those coordinates are only meant to be affected if the touch for that joystick is within the specified zone. I believe this is partly what is contributing to the issue. At this stage I've spent hours trying to figure this out and am just as lost as when I started. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone possibly point me in the right direction with using both of these joysticks at the same time?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","geolocation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13045077,"title":"Needed assistance with getting the users location if there is a change in the users position using HTML5 and JS","body":"<p>I need some help in tracking the user continuously.

The user fills it out, and clicks the submit and it goes to a new page.  It uses HTML5 form validation to indicate required fields.  It uses webShims/polyfill for older browser compatibility.  </p>\n\n<p>That all works as it should.  My issues arises in certain circumstances, I do not want the form to submit to the \"subPage\" (the default action on the form).  Instead I want it to simply close the modal-form, staying on the page that displayed the modal.  (This occurs in the event that the email is already in the system - do not want to take the user to the secondary form page showing a message that the email is already in the system).</p>\n\n<p>If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").click(function(event){ blah blah blah }); - then I can control the submission vs. non-submission.  However, I then lose the HTML5 form validation feature.  If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").submit(function(event){ blah blah blah }); the form validation works, but the page submits and the event is not being captured by the code.</p>\n\n<p>All the researching I've done to date indicates that IE7 does not play well with the .submit event, however, I need the .submit event for the form validation to work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way for these three things to work together?  IE7 is the only browser causing my issue.  the .submit/form validation works as intended in FF, IE9, Opera, and Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
