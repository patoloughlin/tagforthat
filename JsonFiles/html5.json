Then as each video ended, I removed the previous  node and appended the next  element.</p>\n\n<p>Code executed on page load:</p>\n\n<pre>\nfor (i in timelinePlay)\n    if (timelinePlay[i] != null)        \n    {\n        var element = document.createElement('video');\n        element.id = 'video1-' + (i);\n        element.src = timelinePlay[i]['URL'];\n        element.preload = 'load';\n        video1Array[i] = element;\n    }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Code for video 'ended' event:</p>\n\n<pre>\nvideoElement.addEventListener(\"ended\", function (event) {\n    if (this.currentTime > 0)\n    {\n        if (player.hasChildNodes())\n            while (player.childNodes.length > 0)\n                player.removeChild(player.firstChild);\n\n        player = document.getElementById('canvas-player');\n        player.appendChild(video1Array[timelineCurrent]);\n\n        nextVideo = document.getElementById('video1-' + timelineCurrent);\n\n        nextVideo.play();\n\n        timelineCurrent++;\n    }\n}, false);\n</pre>\n\n<p>(Note that these code examples are partial and somewhat simplified.  Also, I do realize that my use of Objects as Associative Arrays is not best practice)</p>\n\n<p>The result of this modification was MUCH closer, because the videos were now loaded by the time they were required to play, but there was still a short and inconsistent gap between the videos.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt #3\nI replaced the 'ended' event listener with a 'timeupdate' listener, beginning as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>\nnextVideo.addEventListener(\"timeupdate\", function (event)\n{\n    if (this.currentTime > (this.duration - 0.1)  && this.currentTime > 1)\n    {\n        this.removeEventListener(\"timeupdate\", function () { return; }, false);\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>('this.currentTime > 1' is simply to ensure that the previous video actually plays)</p>\n\n<p>My hope was that the gap between videos was close enough to being consistent that starting the next video an arbitrary 0.1 seconds before the previous video ended would correct the gap to an acceptable extent.  The result was that the timing was indeed better, but it was skipping videos.  I attribute the skipped videos to misfiring of the 'timeupdate' event, but I could be mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>Other alternative options I had also considered:\nSMIL Script (seems to be obsolete, and would likely have the same syncing issues anyway)\nffmpeg on the backend to concatenate the videos (my host will not allow shell scripts)</p>\n\n<p>FYI I am developing for Safari 5.0.3 at the moment</p>\n"},{"tags":["security","file-io","html5","filesystems"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":19,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7934,"score":19,"question_id":2376745,"title":"Does HTML5 allow you to interact with local client files from within a browser","body":"<p>I've seen some posts regarding access to files on a client machine by a webpage, namely this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292566/browser-application-local-file-system-access\">question</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to hop on the \"continuously update in the cloud\" paradigm for some algorithms I am writing so my users can access the latest versions by simply accessing the webpage.

Solution must be cross platform (including feature phones) if it exists, which I doubt it does.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html5","jquery-mobile"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1259,"score":0,"question_id":8822907,"title":"Html5 - Cross Browser Iframe postmessage - child to parent?","body":"<p>I've been following this tutorial - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2hOvZ7bwXU\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2hOvZ7bwXU</a>, which basically explains how to use postmessage to securely pass a message between iframe and parent - you basically end up with something like this - <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/postmessage2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://html5demos.com/postmessage2</a></p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I need it to work the opposite way round (child to parent) and dont know how to target the parent window.</p>\n\n<p>this is my receiver code (in the parent) - </p>\n\n<pre><code>function handlingMsg(e)\n{alert(\"works\")\n    if(e.origin == \"http://uc.dialogue.net\")\n        {\n                var blah = e.data;\n                alert(blah);    \n        }\n        else{alert(\"error\");}\n}\naddEventListener(\"message\",handlingMsg, true);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this is the sender function that is triggered by a simple form (in child) - </p>\n\n<pre><code>   var text=$('.srchInput').val();\n   window.parent.postMessage(text, \"http://uc.dialogue.net\");   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Should I be targeting the parent in a different way?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers\nPaul</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","web-audio"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13288380,"title":"Do Web Audio API events run in a separate thread?","body":"<p>I'm particularly interested in the <strong><em>onaudioprocess</em></strong> of the <strong><em>ScriptProcessorNode</em></strong> (until recently called <em>JavaScriptNode</em>).

I have decided to create a really basic site and build it up to be like the main app and see where it breaks. I have done this and got stuck straight away with the offline caching.</p>\n\n<p>This is a basic 3 page static website hosted locally in IIS 7.5. I created the folder c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ManifestTesting, added it to IIS as a web application and added a new MIME type of text/cache-manifest for the .appcache extension. I am also using FireFox 9.0 for testing as this has an offline mode feature.</p>\n\n<p>I created 3 html pages and added them to the ManifestTesting folder:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>index.htm - this page contains 2 links to page1.htm and page2.htm</li>\n<li>page1.htm - just contains a header that says page 1</li>\n<li>page2.htm - just contains a header that says page 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So now if I browse to <a href=\"http://localhost/manifesttesting\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost/manifesttesting</a> if get the index page and can navigate to the 2 pages.</p>\n\n<p>I then created a file called manifest.appcache and added it to the ManifestTesting folder:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CACHE MANIFEST\n\nCACHE:\nindex.htm\npage1.htm\npage2.htm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and added the reference to the manifest file in the index.htm:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html manifest=\"manifest.appcache\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if I clear all history and browse to the index.htm, FireFox asks if I want to allow the website to store data for offline use. I click allow, switch the browser to offline mode then attempt to navigate to page1.htm which works fine! So all is good so far.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the bit that I don't understand. I then created a new folder in the ManifestTesting folder called 'pages' and moved page1 and page2 into it. I updated the links in the index to reference the new location and if I browse the website without the manifest reference, it all works fine just as before. I then re-reference the manifest file in the index and update the manifest to be like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CACHE MANIFEST\n\nCACHE:\nindex.htm\npages/page1.htm\npages/page2.htm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then clear history, refresh, firefox asks to allow the website to store offline data, enable offline mode and then attempt to navigate to page1 - it doesn't work! FireFox tells me it's in offline mode and can't browse the web!</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","amazon-s3","cors","plupload"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":0,"question_id":13282652,"title":"How to implement plupload directly to s3 with 'html5' runtime?","body":"<p>It is mentioned in this very related question (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8463694/upload-directly-to-amazon-s3-using-plupload-html5-runtime\">Upload directly to Amazon S3 using Plupload HTML5 runtime</a>) that amazon now allows CORS uploads using HTML5, but has anyone successfully configured plupload to push files to s3 using the 'html5' runtime?

This personally doesn't bother me, or 99% percent of users, but in the past (for doing something similar) I've been contacted by a user who was concerned about their page invalidating with a particular DocType due to the plugin markup. I can't recall entirely why this DocType was required (lost the email), but I think it may have had something to do with some HTTPS payment pages and security validation. I actually think this may have tied in with one of the plugin links not being HTTPS as well. Really vague, I know.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that kind-of poses another question. Is valid markup ever officially required as well?</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate anyone who can enlighten me. Again, I'm all for HTML5, as are most, but with the nature of such things (like Wordpress plugins) it can be important to support a wide range of use cases not to alienate specific users (or at least provide them with alternative options).</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","loops","video","html5-video"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":2,"question_id":13268972,"title":"loop html5 video using ended event broken","body":"<p>I am searching for the holy grail of a simple looping html5 video, I am currently using the following code which doesn't seem work</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;video width=\"650\" height=\"650\" class=\"outer_shadow\" autoplay=\"\" ended=\"this.play()\" loop&gt;\n    &lt;source src=\"/videos?video_id=ag1kZXZ-anQtd2luZG93cg4LEghUaW1lRGF0YRgNDA\"&gt;\n&lt;/video&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can anyone could hilight why this code doesn't work/suggest their best work arround?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","audio","web","volume"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13279758,"title":"Visual Mic Level Display using HTML5/Javascript","body":"<p>Here's the idea:</p>\n\n<p>A level meter that displays sound output from a user's mic.</p>\n\n<p>The tricky part: </p>\n\n<p>Having it work on a website using only HTML5/Javascript.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","cache-manifest"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4,"score":0,"question_id":13280439,"title":"html5 manifest cache https and external urls","body":"<p>I have the following cache.manifest file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CACHE MANIFEST \\n\nCACHE: \n/ \n/Content/Site.css \n/Scripts/base.js \n/Images/slider3.jpg\nhttps://api.trollbeadspartner.com/image.axd?f=c/trollbeads&amp;s=c&amp;id=6A6777786E746C79\nhttps://api.trollbeadspartner.com/image.axd?f=p/trollbeads&amp;s=s&amp;id=36363B3636\nhttps://api.trollbeadspartner.com/image.axd?f=p/trollbeads&amp;s=m&amp;id=36363B3636\n\nNETWORK: \n* \n\nFALLBACK: \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically chrome cahces the first 4 elements, but stops at the first image which is acquired from an external API.

Specifically, I want to be able to style the number/bullet in the same manner as the rest of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> content.</p>\n\n<p>From the testing I've done, the browser never styles  <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags directly (which actually controls the style of the number/bullet) but always places a <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tag (or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> if <code>StyleWithCSS</code>) as the first child node, using it for the formatting. I've tried a few ideas already to get around this, but have not found success:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Apply styles to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> programmatically</h2>\n\n<p>Here I tried listening for 'DOMNodeInserted' and when an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag was inserted into the DOM, I queried the current <code>fontName</code>, <code>fontSize</code>, and <code>foreColor</code> commands and applied them as an inline style on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>textarea.addEventListener('DOMNodeInserted', function (evt) {\n    if (evt.target.nodeName === 'LI') {\n        evt.target.style.color = queryCommandValue('foreColor');\n        evt.target.style.fontFamily = queryCommandValue('fontName');\n        evt.target.style.fontSize = queryCommandValue('fontSize');\n    }\n}, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even when doing this, as soon as you begin typing in the list item, the browser tries to be \"smart\" and strips the styles from the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, placing them into a <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>) tag.  :(</p>\n\n<h2>2. Create a rule for the styles to be inserted into the StyleSheet</h2>\n\n<p>Based off the attempt above, instead of writing the styles inline, I created a rule for them, gave the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> node an ID, and inserted the rule into the stylesheet. Now the rule would govern the style of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, and I could use the CSSOM to continually update any particular <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s styles.</p>\n\n<p>This seemed to work very well (with a few bugs to solve for), however, it completely breaks the contentEditable undo stack. Since the undo command is only tied to <code>textContent</code> and other formatting commands, there is no way to \"undo\" the styles you are setting in the stylesheet. (At least not very intuitively, I've thought about how this might be done...)</p>\n\n<h2>3. Watch for changes in the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s attributes and retain them</h2>\n\n<p>For this attempt, I made use of the newly-available MutationObserver <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutationobserve\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutationobserver</a> available in DOM level 4. This observer can watch for changes in a node's attributes, which will be passed back in a MutationRecord. It can even hold the previous attribute values, including <code>style</code> values, so I could find out what was being removed and re-apply it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var observer = new WebKitMutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n    mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {\n        if (mutation.target.nodeName === 'LI') {\n            ...\n        }\n    })\n});\n\nobserver.observe(document, {\n    attributes: true,\n    subtree: true,\n    attributeOldValue: true\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This still suffers from lack of undo support. You will undo other formatting changes but the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s will keep their styles.</p>\n\n<p>Any novel ideas out there? Modern-browser only solutions welcomed as well. I'm aware that I could format my own HTML to use for lists but I'm trying to see if this can be done using the standard <code>insertOrderedList</code> and <code>insertUnorderedList</code> commands which use real list tags. </p>\n\n<h2>** Update Nov 7 2012 **</h2>\n\n<p>Doesn't look like anyone has solved this yet, here is an example JSFiddle to see what I'm describing: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/8LyZR/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/8LyZR/</a>.

I thought this was a recommended way to create a game loop.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Frame Test&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"/css/bootstrap.css\" media=\"all\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js\"\n        type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/jquery.hotkeys.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/key_status.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/util.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script language=\"javascript\" src=\"js/sprite.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;button id=\"button1\"&gt;\n        Toggle Loop&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;h1 id=\"frameCount\"&gt;\n        Game Loop Test&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;canvas id=\"gameCanvas\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support canvas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/canvas&gt;\n    &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n\n\n\n        // demo code used for playing around with javascript-canvas animations\n        var frameCount = 0;\n        var drawingCanvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');\n        // Check the element is in the DOM and the browser supports canvas\n        if (drawingCanvas.getContext) {\n            var context = drawingCanvas.getContext('2d');\n            var x = 100;\n            var y = 100;\n            var right = true;\n            context.strokeStyle = \"#000000\";\n            context.fillStyle = \"Green\";\n            context.beginPath();\n            context.arc(x, y, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);\n            context.closePath();\n            context.stroke();\n            context.fill();\n\n        }\n\n\n\n        function Timer(settings) {\n            this.settings = settings;\n            this.timer = null;\n            this.on = false;  //Bool that represents if the timer is running or stoped\n            this.fps = settings.fps || 30;  //Target frames per second value\n            this.interval = Math.floor(1000 / 30);\n            this.timeInit = null;  //Initial time taken when start is called\n\n            return this;\n        }\n\n        Timer.prototype =\n            {\n                run: function () {\n                    var $this = this;\n\n                    this.settings.run();\n                    this.timeInit += this.interval;\n\n                    this.timer = setTimeout(\n                function () { $this.run() },\n                this.timeInit - (new Date).getTime()\n            );\n                },\n\n                start: function () {\n                    if (this.timer == null) {\n                        this.timeInit = (new Date).getTime();\n                        this.run();\n                        this.on = true;\n                    }\n                },\n\n                stop: function () {\n                    clearTimeout(this.timer);\n                    this.timer = null;\n                    this.on = false;\n                },\n\n                toggle: function () {\n\n                    if (this.on) { this.stop(); }\n                    else { this.start(); }\n                }\n            }\n\n        var timer = new Timer({\n            fps: 30,\n            run: function () {\n                //---------------------------------------------run game code here------------------------------------------------------\n                //Currently Chorme is playing a catch up game with the frames to be drawn when the user leaves the browser window and then returns\n                //A simple canvas animation is drawn here to try and figure out how to solve this issue.

However, when I resize the window it's very sluggish. I've temporarily gotten around this by putting in a throttler, which just sets a timer to avoid firing the above functions too quickly. This helps slightly, but will keep the background image in place (displaying open solid background areas around the image) until the throttler timer kicks in and fires the methods - resizing the canvas/image and applying the filter. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a faster way? I've read about using Typed Arrays/Bitwise for pixel manipulation loops, but it seems that support is horrible for this. I've also looked into CSS3 filters to accomplish the same thing, but again, support is horrible. So, would this be the only approach to full-screen background image filters with \"modern browser\" compatibility?</p></li>\n<li><p>The updateCanvas method is creating a new image object each time, I'm thinking that this might be a bottleneck, but am unsure, and also unsure of how to get around it?</p></li>\n<li><p>I've read others using a separate canvas as a buffer? Would this actually increase performance in my situation? </p></li>\n<li><p>I'm really thinking there's a major logic issue in my code somewhere. It just doesn't make sense to me that I would need to loop through all of the pixel information more than once, but this is the only way I've gotten it to work. Isn't there a way I can draw it/apply the filter once, then on resize, just adjust the dimensions without having to redraw/reloop/reapply the filter? I would think that it would maintain the filtered image, but if I remove the call to the canvasFilter method on window resize, it completely removes the filter effect. </p></li>\n<li><p>I've yet to use memoization techniques as I've never quite understood it, and never quite understand where/when to use it. But, essentially, if I have a function that is returning the same results again and again (such as the canvasFilter method) can I memoize to increase performance - or would it be difference because it's pulling different pixel information after the window has resized?</p></li>\n<li><p>I've also heard that a webGL render might help with this? Might be way off as I don't know anything about webGL.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So sorry for the loooonng question, but hopefully this covers some topics that others can benefit from as well. Any suggestions/tips would be much appreciated.

It's been working great so far except for one thing. In the HTML5 specification, the input type \"number\" can have both integers and floating point numbers. This seems incredibly short-sighted since it will only be a useful validator when your database fields are signed floating point numbers (for unsigned ints you'll have to fall back to \"pattern\" validation and thus loose extra features like the up and down arrows for browsers that support it). Is there another input type or perhaps an attribute that would restrict the input to just unsigned integers?

Setting the step to 1 is not the answer since it doesn't restrict the input. You can still type a negative floating point number into the textbox. Also, I am aware of pattern validation (I mentioned it in my original post), but that was not part of the question. I wanted to know if HTML5 allowed restricting an input of type \"number\" to positive integer values. To this question the answer, it seems, would be \"no, it does not\". I didn't want to use pattern validation because this causes some drawbacks when using jQuery Tools validation, but it now seems that the specification doesn't allow for a cleaner way to do this. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html5","jsf","canvas","graph"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":276,"score":2,"question_id":10621091,"title":"JSF for drawing graphs (not a chart, but a DAG) in HTML5","body":"<p>I want to draw some nodes (might be substituted by small thumbnails) and connect them with lines.

We wanted to come up with an <strong>ideal workflow</strong> to prepare, publish, and run high-quality animated graphics in the browser. So ideally have a single source of animation data that would work for small smartphone screens, tablets, retina displays, and desktop browsers.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, (vector-based) SVG should be ideal for that, but since SVG is not usually used that much - we decided to test it out. The idea was not to use SMIL SVG (so no SVG-based animation) but instead create an animation sprite-sheet (as you normally would with raster data PNG/JPG) but do this with pure vectors i.e. SVG. Its was a bit bigger but if it works this - it would work even with something thats even more optimized.</p>\n\n<p>Plus frame-by-frame vector animation could do great things for our workflow - it would allow us to use the Flash editor to do the animations and then export them to SVG sprite sheets.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <strong>the result works surprisingly well</strong> but also fails in some areas (please note for test purposes we only worked with Webkit-based browsers i.e. Safari, Chrome, mobile Safari on iOS, and Android ICS).</p>\n\n<p>In CSS it's pretty easy to trigger hardware acceleration for a sprite sheet like this (at least in modern browsers with keyframes and steps) - you simply do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>background-image: url(my.svg);\n-webkit-animation: walk 1s steps(12, end) infinite; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to call keyframe-based animation shown here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes walk {\n    from { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); }\n    to { -webkit-transform: translate3d(-100%, 0, 0); }          \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the use of translate3d should let GPU kick in and the entire thing should be hardware accelerated in iOS mobile Safari and Android ICS browser.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly enough considering that it's kind of a brute-force technique and a fairly large vector animation (600x600px for the test) - the whole thing flies. But its not perfect - it flickers in Safari before taking off. And in the ICS browser its flickering all the time so its not really usable.</p>\n\n<p>So we tried the usual tricks to get rid of flickering such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);    \n-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\n-webkit-perspective: 1000;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that didn't work. So then we tried rasterizing SVG dynamically in memory and using it as a texture with <em>-webkit-transform: scale3d(1, 1, 0)</em> but that didn't help ether. </p>\n\n<p>Finally we just replaced the SVG with a rendered out PNG/JPG sprite sheet of the same size thinking the complex vectors are just too much for the browser - but guess what? Its the same issue - so its not SVG rendering at all - <strong>its a browser drawing issue.</strong> A further proof of that is if we slow the animation down to 1FPS - flickering still persists.</p>\n\n<p>Is the image just too big for GPU? Have we reached the performance limit of what you're able to comfortably draw/animate in the browser (mobile in particular)?</p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate ideas/hacks on how to potentially get rid of the flickering (especially since its performing sooo fast). Its just a promising technique - hight performance browser animation that adapts to different screen sizes - <strong>the HTML5 Holy Grail</strong> ;)</p>\n\n<p>With a few optimizations such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;svg preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMax slice\" viewBox=\"0 0 600 50\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and some CSS magic we're able to have the SVG adapt to its container perfectly and change its size from a single CSS class. It really would work wonders - but alas the flickering.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway - please <strong>read more about it here</strong> (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/INMKZT\">http://bit.ly/INMKZT</a>) where you're also able to <strong>try it out</strong>. </p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","favicon","rel"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":13211206,"title":"HTML5 `<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" />`","body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#attr-hyperlink-rel\" rel=\"nofollow\">WHATWG document</a> for HTML5 says that the <code>rel</code> attribute must contain values that are space-separated, and then it gives a table of allowed values.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The attribue's value must be a set of space-separated tokens.

I'm using some videos as backgrounds inside a couple of slides. While I've tried many plugins, some worked erratically with jScrollPane so I ended up using \"simpleVideo jQuery plugin\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/markupboy/simpleVideo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/markupboy/simpleVideo</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The plugin uses the video tag to play everything. I'm including a video tag inside every page, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            &lt;div class=\"rsImg page\" id=\"page1\"&gt;\n\n                &lt;video poster=\"video/poster.png\" id=\"video-intro\"&gt;\n                    &lt;source src=\"video/trailer_480p.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\"&gt;\n                    &lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"&gt;\n                &lt;/video&gt;\n\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;!-- END OF PAGE 1--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Video plays and behaves correctly, it's nice.</p>\n\n<p>But as I add more slides, I'm getting worried about memory usage and slowness in the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>I have a function that listens for a \"SlideChange\" event, so destroying the video wouldn't be much of a problem once the slide changes, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  poshSlider.ev.on('rsAfterSlideChange', function() {\nif(poshSlider.currSlideId+1!=1)\n{\n  $('#video-intro').trigger('stop');\n  $('video').empty().remove();\n} else {\n  $('#page1').append('&lt;video poster=\"video/poster.png\" id=\"video-intro\"&gt;&lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/ogg\"&gt;&lt;source src=\"video/video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;');\n  $('#video-intro').simpleVideo();\n  $('#video-intro').trigger('play');\n}\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I've tried with emptying and removing the whole div, video tag and such. Then, to reinitialize the video I thought of appending the same code in the same place, but it doesn't work as expected and I don't know if it's a good way when it comes to taking care of memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p>What would be a way of loading and unloading videos considering my approach?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was using \"append\" instead of \"html\".

In HTML5, each section can have its own heading element so it is okay to have more than one <code>h1</code>. I've seen a Wordpress theme framework, <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/2012/02/21/getting-started-with-the-underscores-theme/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"underscores\"</a>, which seem to apply this in the fullest.</p>\n\n<p>However, this may seem to pose problem for older browsers (yet to support HTML5) in defining the site structure/document outline.

Matt Cutts also imply that multiple <code>h1</code> is not too good for SEO.</p>\n\n<p>However,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I previously never paid serious attention to site structure/document outline.

Ideally I'd use a worker to spawn subworkers but this does not have as wide of a support as workers alone. So since modern browsers support from 4-8 (mobile even more) parallel http connections per domain - I was wondering if I could just open 8 workers and use them for loading/crunching/encoding (with a queue function in my main thread delegating files to load). Are there possibly any performance considerations here?</p>\n\n<p>I guess this is an architecture question - how many workers can you open without impacting stability? I guess system developers know more about spawning threads than just poor web developers ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Another question - since my app is performance sensitive and workers are potentially initialising quite a bit of code at start I was thinking that instead of creating/destroying workers dynamically I would just create 6 of them at application start and keep them \"open\" and running during the entire lifespan of my app. They're not crunching data all the time - just from time to time when XHR requests/encoding is needed - so keeping them open when they're not doing anything should not make much difference right? Or would extra unused threads still impact the main application thread (or browser) somehow?</p>\n"},{"tags":["forms","html5","tornado"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13160340,"title":"how to make that the server trust client side validation?","body":"<p>i found sometimes -said- that <em>an application must have two validation: client side and server side</em>.</p>\n\n<p>my question: is there any way to make a kind of trusting message that is crypted, so only the server and client will understand, so like that the server will avoid form verification, because when i've added regex to validation in python, this increased my application reponse time!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","image","html5","html5-canvas","kineticjs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":13139671,"title":"Resizing the images while keeping proportion using kinetic js canvas","body":"<p>I'm using this in my app:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images/</a></p>\n\n<p>have use anchors for resizing the image ..</p>\n\n<p>What I want is to resize the image and keep its ratio maintained.\nI don't want it to stretch \nI'm able to achieve that using this peace of code.:..</p>\n\n<pre><code>  if(width) {\n        image.setSize(width);\n      }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this is screwing up the anchors ..\nAnyone ever tried something like this..</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","html5","ipad"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":24,"score":-2,"question_id":13158016,"title":"Access camera from browser without using flash/silverlight","body":"<p>I want to access camera from browser.

I can't change the volume, nor can I send text messages automatically (although I can with Android OS). So, if I wanted to make my phone turn to silent with no vibrate between 9pm and 7am Monday - Sunday... I can't.</p>\n\n<p>If I wanted to schedule a text at a later date, I can't - all I can do is have the message populated, ready for me to send.</p>\n\n<p>And why? It makes little sense to limit these. OK, it makes some sense in regards to stopping developers having access to sending text messages (to protect the consumer from malicious dudes (especially if there is a cost of the text involved))... but no! This is what internet security does - or the UAC in Windows... It allows users to set permissions. A program should try to send a text, the OS detect it and a new rule is created to always allow / deny (depending on user input) (with a  nice little remember my preference setting). </p>\n\n<p>Any way, sorry for the rant but these 2 features are vital for the style of apps I've been asked to create. So, finally, my question: I know the SDK for WP8 is rumoured to be released late July 2012, but do we know if the limitation I mentioned above are to be lifted? </p>\n\n<p>And my second question is, are any .NET developers running out to learn javscript because they feel that C# or VB.Net will suffer or go the same way as silverlight. I don't think it will but with so much marketing going on about HTML 5 I am interested to see if anyone is concerned about this. </p>\n\n<p>Dave</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":95,"score":1,"question_id":11435493,"title":"How to create HTML5 100% offline applications?","body":"<p>Sometimes I need to write a small program just to represent some data in a chart, or similar stuff.

Works great in all IOS devices as they have native web-socket support, and works fairly consistently in android devices when you have flash installed. Now, Android ICS 4.03 and above claims to support native web-sockets. Window.WebSocket is defined, but I'm having no luck opening the socket. Does anyone know why?

Has anyone come up with a better solution?</p>\n\n<p>=Update=</p>\n\n<p>There is a hacky way to determine if the websocket actually works, and then fallback to flash. To do this you have to change the web-socket-js code to check if it is an android client. then, before using the web-socket, try to connect to a port on the local machine. Then check the protocol property of the websocket. If this is defined, then you are good to go with native, otherwise fall back to flash.

Right now, I'm working on my first HTML5 program on my own, and it's a really simple top down shooter. Right now, I've got the code written so that a ship appears on the screen that you can move side to side. However, now I'm trying to create a new object to draw called bullet. I kind of copied the code from the ship, but I can't get it to work. So far, here is the code. It's fairly small, so you can understand the ship. Here's the ship object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function ship() {\n    this.width = 100;\n    this.height = 75;\n    this.drawX = gameWidth/2 - this.width/2;\n    this.drawY = gameHeight - this.height - 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do draw that, I use this function: </p>\n\n<pre><code>ship.prototype.draw = function() {\n    clearCtx(ctxPlayer);\n    var srcX;\n    var srcY;\n    if(isRightKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 75;\n    } else if (isLeftKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 153;\n    } else {\n        srcX= 0;\n        srcY = 0;\n    }\n\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,srcX,srcY,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That stuff towards the top only changes the source of the image because the image is different if it's moving one way or another. Anyway, here's the bullet object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function BulletGreen() {\n    var drawX = 0;\n    var drawY = 0;\n    var height = 33;\n    var width = 9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it's pretty similar. Now, here's the code I use to draw it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BulletGreen.prototype.draw = function drawBulletsGreen() {\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,350,0,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this just doesn't seem to work when I use the command in the console. It returns no errors but doesn't seem to change the canvas at all. However, doing something like </p>\n\n<pre><code>ctxBullet.drawImage(sprites,0,0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will draw out the sprite sheet onto the canvas. I apologize if this sort of question isn't welcome here, but I'm just out of ideas!

In particular, a single-page web application should support the browser history, including the back and forward buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Most frameworks for single-page web applications do support the browser history. But they do not seem to emulate one crucial thing: When I am on, say, page 1 of a traditional web application and fill in a form field, navigate away to page 2 of the application and then click the back button, the browser will restore my input.</p>\n\n<p>With a single-page web application, one of two things usually happens: Either the form field of page 1 is still part of the DOM (but hidden) on page 2 (or at least part of a Javascript data structure), so that the application may show me the filled-in form field again after navigating back, or the form field is created anew everytime I visit page 1 (either through direct navigation or by pressing the back button). In the latter case, my former input is not restored.</p>\n\n<p>It seems clear that the former is the better. But even this solution isn't perfect: In a tradition web application, each history entry has its own cached values of form fields, even if the history contains the previously mentioned page 1 several times. The single-page application which doesn't recreate the form fields on every in-application navigation, however, caches only a single value for every form field.</p>\n\n<p>One idea to solve this problem and making single-page web applications better, would be to store the values of the form fields in the <em>data</em> attribute of the pushState and replaceState methods of the HTML5 history interface to have them stored along the other history information.

And the other tiles are working just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for collision detection and tile drawing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Function that allows you to draw a tile\nfunction drawTile(type, x, y, collision){\n    var tileImg = new Image();\n    tileImg.onload = function(){\n        ctx.drawImage(tileImg, x, y)\n    };\n    tileImg.src = \"images/\" + type + \".png\";\n\n    if (collision){\n        //Worst collision detection ever.\n        if((player_x + player_width == x) &amp;&amp; (player_y + player_height &gt; y)){\n            canMoveRight = false;\n        }else if((player_x == x + 32) &amp;&amp; (player_y + player_height &gt; y)){\n            canMoveLeft = false;\n        }else if((player_y + player_height &gt; y) &amp;&amp; (player_x + player_width &gt;= x) &amp;&amp; (player_x + player_width &lt;= x + 64)){\n            player_y = y - player_height;\n        }else{\n            canMoveRight = true;\n            canMoveLeft = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n//Draw the map\nfunction drawMap(){\n    drawTile(\"block\", 96, 208, true);\n    drawTile(\"block\", 128, 208, true);\n    drawTile(\"block\", 128, 176, true);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the collision detection code kinda sucks. So it also would be good if you showed me better ways of making it.</p>\n\n<p>Just say if you need to know something. :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","audio","html5-audio"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13078889,"title":"Working with AudioContext with a source from audio tag","body":"<p>I'm building a music player and I'd like to add a pulsation effect depending on the track currently played. </p>\n\n<p>Here some examples of what I'd want:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.htmlfivewow.com/demos/hal/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.htmlfivewow.com/demos/hal/index.html</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/360-player/canvas-visualization.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/360-player/canvas-visualization.html</a></p>\n\n<p>My problem is that in the first example, sound is loaded via xhr, and in the second it uses flash. </p>\n\n<p>I'd want to be able to get the sound that I want to analyze from the audio tag.</p>\n\n<p>I'm afraid it could not be possible, it would cause a big lack of security because we could load web pages instead of sound and then analyse it.

Right now, I'm working on my first HTML5 program on my own, and it's a really simple top down shooter. Right now, I've got the code written so that a ship appears on the screen that you can move side to side. However, now I'm trying to create a new object to draw called bullet. I kind of copied the code from the ship, but I can't get it to work. So far, here is the code. It's fairly small, so you can understand the ship. Here's the ship object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function ship() {\n    this.width = 100;\n    this.height = 75;\n    this.drawX = gameWidth/2 - this.width/2;\n    this.drawY = gameHeight - this.height - 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do draw that, I use this function: </p>\n\n<pre><code>ship.prototype.draw = function() {\n    clearCtx(ctxPlayer);\n    var srcX;\n    var srcY;\n    if(isRightKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 75;\n    } else if (isLeftKey) {\n        srcX = 0;\n        srcY = 153;\n    } else {\n        srcX= 0;\n        srcY = 0;\n    }\n\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,srcX,srcY,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That stuff towards the top only changes the source of the image because the image is different if it's moving one way or another. Anyway, here's the bullet object: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function BulletGreen() {\n    var drawX = 0;\n    var drawY = 0;\n    var height = 33;\n    var width = 9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it's pretty similar. Now, here's the code I use to draw it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BulletGreen.prototype.draw = function drawBulletsGreen() {\n    ctxPlayer.drawImage(sprites,350,0,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY, this.width, this.height);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this just doesn't seem to work when I use the command in the console. It returns no errors but doesn't seem to change the canvas at all. However, doing something like </p>\n\n<pre><code>ctxBullet.drawImage(sprites,0,0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will draw out the sprite sheet onto the canvas. I apologize if this sort of question isn't welcome here, but I'm just out of ideas!

Does anyone have a doc on this?</p>\n\n<p>I see there is a list on the <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/named-character-references.html#named-character-references\">WHATWG</a> spec but I'm not sure if it affects files served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. By any means the two mentioned trigger errors in both Chromium nightly and FF 3.6.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","angularjs","angular"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":75,"score":3,"question_id":13076536,"title":"Why is an input of type=\"number\" not showing updates to its bound value?","body":"<p>A set of HTML input controls are bound to testVar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-app&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=\"TestCtrl\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"range\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" ng-model=\"testVar\"&gt;\n        &lt;button ng-click=\"testVar = 5\"&gt;set to 5&lt;/button&gt;              \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Initially all the input controls show this value as expected, but the type=\"number\" input becomes blank when testVar is changed via the type=\"range\" or type=\"text\" inputs.

However, I can't seem to figure out how to get drag and drop to work in Safari, while it works perfectly in Chrome and Firefox. More precisely, it seems that drop event does not fire in Safari, when you try to drag an image inside the website into the drop area. At the same time it does fire when you drag and drop a file from desktop.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not really sure, but I'm pretty certain that when I tried the same script at work (where I have Safari 5.0.2 etc), it fired the drop event (going to check it tomorrow to be sure) and gave me the FileReader-related errors that were expected. But when I just installed Safari 5.1 on my own PC, I only get dragover, enter and leave events (and drop too if the file was dragged into the browser).</p>\n\n<p>I've been Googling for some time now and don't seem to find a single example of drag and drop that actually works in Safari 5.1. Even Safari's <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Tasks/DragAndDrop.html\">dev-centre's sample</a> doesn't work, let alone <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/drag\">html5demo.com 1</a> and <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/drag-anything\">html5demo.com 2</a>. This leads me to think whether the Safari has a bug, or maybe they have implemented something mandatory that isn't reflected in the dev-centre (last updated in 2009).</p>\n\n<p>The script I'm trying to fix is at <a href=\"http://www.ut.ee/~vahurr/memebuilder\">my site</a> (sorry guys, no problem specific code to post, as it seems to be broken elsewhere too).</p>\n\n<p>PS! I might have introduced some bugs into my own site while desperately trying to fix the drag and drop in Safari, but I'm too tired to fix them right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Just confirmed at work that the drop event does fire in Safari 5.0.2 on Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Also confirmed that everything works perfectly fine with Safari 5.0.6 on Win 7, the same computer that fails with 5.1</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","iis6","video-streaming","mime-types"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":149,"score":0,"question_id":11401753,"title":"IIS 6.0 loses MIME type after I set it","body":"<p>I'm hosting a few videos on an IIS server running version 6.0 and I have set my MIME types up properly (.mp4, video/mp4), however when I try and stream those videos it consistently tells me that the MIME types aren't supported. </p>\n\n<p>Since I'm running IIS I don't think I need to worry about .htaccess but I could be wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Any idea how I could be losing the MIME information?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","image","html5","canvas","game-engine"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":13077181,"title":"HTML5 - How to just draw the finished canvas/image","body":"<p>I'm making a little game with HTML5 and MooTools and I have performance problems on firefox.

I am not positive, but this solution only seems to work if Internet Explorer is version 9 or greater, which is not ideal, but definitely better than no support at all. I also do not think that I can do this onload like they did seeing I will be populating my draggable objects from a database, so onload will probably have fired before the items have been placed into the dropzone. <a href=\"http://marakana.com/s/html5_drag_n_drop_api,1071/samples/try2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://marakana.com/s/html5_drag_n_drop_api,1071/samples/try2.htm</a> Specifically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(myDiv.dragDrop){\n    myDiv.onselectstart=function(){this.dragDrop();return false};\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not trying to attain 100% browser compatibility, but I would like to get Internet Explorer and Firefox.

This is not my most pressing concern, but if you did happen to see a fix that would be great!(sorting only works on the upper dropzone) I do not want to use jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Basic drag and drop example&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;style&gt;\n    @CHARSET \"UTF-8\";\ntable.draggable-word {\n    background-color: red;\n    padding: 0px;\n    border: 1px solid green;\n    -webkit-touch-callout: none;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -khtml-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    -ms-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    border-spacing: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n    line-height: 1;\n    width: 100%;\n    height:50px;\n}\n\n.drop-div {\n    width: 150px;\n    height: 150px;\n    border: 3px solid #224163;\n    background-color: #AABACC;\n    margin-top: 15px;\n    text-align: center;\n    overflow: auto;\n}\n\n[draggable=true] {\n    cursor: default;\n    margin-top: 0px;\n    margin-bottom: 0px;\n    margin-top: 0px;\n}\n\ntable {\n     border-color: #600;\n    border-width: 0 0 1px 1px;\n    border-style: solid;\n}\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n\nvar user =\"\";\nvar multiples = false;\nvar data;\n\nfunction dragStartHandler(event,id) {\n    event.dataTransfer.setData('Object', event.target.id);\n    user = id;\n    multiples = true;\n     data = event.dataTransfer.getData('Object');\n    //multipleDrag(data,\"false\");\n\n}\nfunction dropHandler(event) {\n    preventDefaults(event);\n    if (!event.target) {\n        alert('we');\n        event.target = event.srcElement\n    }\n    data = event.dataTransfer.getData('Object');\n    event.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));\n    document.getElementById(data).selectedIndex = -1;\n    //alert(user);\n\n\n\n}\nfunction dragOverHandler(event) {\n    preventDefaults(event);\n}\n\nfunction preventDefaults(event) {\n    if (event.preventDefault) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n    }\n\n    try {\n        event.returnValue = false;\n    }\n    catch (exception) {}\n}\n\n\nfunction dragend(event) {\n//    multipleDrag(data,\"true\");\n\n}\n\nfunction multipleDrag(data,state){\n    document.getElementById(data).setAttribute(\"draggable\", state);\n}\n\nfunction sort(uList)\n{\n    var listItem = document.getElementById(uList).getElementsByTagName('td');\n    var listLength = listItem.length;\n    var list = [];\n\n    for(var i=0;

Again, this works perfectly when I only have one finger on the screen/one joystick in use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            if( ig.ua.mobile ) {\n            // ROTATION\n            if (ig.game.joystick1.touchStart.x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; ig.game.joystick1.touchStart.x &lt; ig.system.width/2) {\n                if (Math.abs(ig.game.joystick1.delta.x) &gt;= 50 || Math.abs(ig.game.joystick1.delta.y) &gt;= 50) {\n                    this.joystickAngle = ig.game.Controller.toDegrees(ig.game.Controller.joystickAngle());\n                    if (this.angle &gt; this.joystickAngle + 20) {\n                        this.angle -= this.turnSpeed * ig.system.tick;\n                    }\n\n                    else if (this.angle &lt; this.joystickAngle - 20) {\n                        this.angle += this.turnSpeed * ig.system.tick;\n                    }\n\n                    else {\n                        this.angle = this.joystickAngle;\n                    }\n                } \n            }\n\n            // THRUST\n            if (ig.game.joystick2.touchStart.x &gt; ig.system.width / 2) {\n                if (ig.game.joystick2.delta.y &lt;= -50) {\n                    this.accel.x = Math.cos(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*this.thrust;\n                    this.accel.y = (Math.sin(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*this.thrust);\n                    this.fuel -= 0.1;\n                }\n\n                else if (ig.game.joystick2.delta.y &gt;= 50) {\n                    this.accel.x = Math.cos(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*-this.thrust;\n                    this.accel.y = (Math.sin(this.angle*Math.PI/180)*-this.thrust);\n                    this.fuel -= 0.1;\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            else {\n                this.accel.x = 0;\n                this.accel.y = 0;\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As soon as I place a second finger on the screen, however, the first joystick becomes overwritten. I can rotate and then move or move and then rotate and it works fine, but I need to do both at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>I found out that touchStart.x and touchStart.y seems to be being set for both joysticks when I tap to use the other stick and not just the relevant joystick1 or joystick2, even though in the plugin code those coordinates are only meant to be affected if the touch for that joystick is within the specified zone. I believe this is partly what is contributing to the issue. At this stage I've spent hours trying to figure this out and am just as lost as when I started. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone possibly point me in the right direction with using both of these joysticks at the same time?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","geolocation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13045077,"title":"Needed assistance with getting the users location if there is a change in the users position using HTML5 and JS","body":"<p>I need some help in tracking the user continuously.

The user fills it out, and clicks the submit and it goes to a new page.  It uses HTML5 form validation to indicate required fields.  It uses webShims/polyfill for older browser compatibility.  </p>\n\n<p>That all works as it should.  My issues arises in certain circumstances, I do not want the form to submit to the \"subPage\" (the default action on the form).  Instead I want it to simply close the modal-form, staying on the page that displayed the modal.  (This occurs in the event that the email is already in the system - do not want to take the user to the secondary form page showing a message that the email is already in the system).</p>\n\n<p>If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").click(function(event){ blah blah blah }); - then I can control the submission vs. non-submission.  However, I then lose the HTML5 form validation feature.  If I use $(\"#MyModal #form_reg\").submit(function(event){ blah blah blah }); the form validation works, but the page submits and the event is not being captured by the code.</p>\n\n<p>All the researching I've done to date indicates that IE7 does not play well with the .submit event, however, I need the .submit event for the form validation to work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way for these three things to work together?  IE7 is the only browser causing my issue.  the .submit/form validation works as intended in FF, IE9, Opera, and Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

One does not work in Safari(and probably Internet Exploder). It seems as if options in Safari may not be able to be made into a dragable object? Also in Firefox, the options do not deselect when dropped. This is part of a bigger project, so I will describe somewhat what I am trying to accomplish and why I ventured down the path that I did. So I chose the drop down so that elements could be inserted to and from it, and if needed items could be put in different places in the drop down. In the larger project, there will only be one of these drop downs, and many of the drop-zone divs. The items will be dragged from the drop down into many of these drop fields, but in certain cases may need to go backwards. I am not really sure if there is a better way to do this, but this is what I came up with.

Say I have 4 boxes, with car names. The boxes say saab, volvo, ford, and dodge. The task would be to drag from the drop down all of the cars into there respectable drop zone. Then if the user wanted to put the cars back in the drop down, they could drag them back into the drop down from the drop zone and it would then place them back into alphabetical order.

Data written to the database is read and rendered correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The problem occurs when I update the database. The update is done like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function sync_sites() {\n    display_status('');\n    var jqxhr = $.ajax({\n        type:   \"GET\",\n        url:    '/myapp.pl/REST/sites'\n    })\n    .fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus) {\n        display_status(jqXHR.responseText);\n    })\n    .done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {\n        var sites = jQuery.parseJSON(data.data);\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; sites.length; i++) {\n            myapp.indexedDB.add_site(sites[i]);\n        }\n        alert('sync done');\n    });\n}\n\nmyapp.indexedDB.add_site = function(site) {\n    var db = myapp.indexedDB.db;\n    var trans = db.transaction([\"sites\"], \"readwrite\");\n    var store = trans.objectStore('sites');\n    var request = store.put(site);\n\n    request.onsuccess = function(e) {\n        // TODO: whatever is appropriate if the site is added successfully\n    };\n\n    request.onerror = function(e) {\n        console.log(e.value);\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The update of the database also succeeds.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that shortly after the update of the database begins - just after the 'sync done' alert is displayed, the update_sites function empties the displayed table of sites and does not add any sites: as if the database were empty. Then, if I keep reloading the sites display, after a few more seconds (several reloads) several hundreds to a few thousand rows are added to the sites table, with each row duplicated several times. There are actually 216 records in the sites store/table normally.

I immediately run into two problems. I come across another ontology that also has vocabulary describing a Person.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: Some of these terms are functionally equivalent or related, but I don't want to be bothered wrapping both ontologies around the same object,</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span property=\"foaf:name\"&gt;&lt;span property=\"dc:creator\"&gt;Carl Boettiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because that's cumbersome and seems to ignore the entire idea of <strong>linked</strong> data, which should presumably be smart enough to know that a <code>dc:creator</code> is also a <code>foaf:person.</code>  So what's the correct way to to do this?  How can I confirm the relationship between these objects (e.g. presumably not all <code>foaf:person</code> should be <code>dc:creator</code>.  Is it said somewhere on the Semantic Web that <code>dc:creator</code> is a subset of <code>foaf:person</code>?  Do I need to link to such a statement somehow?  Can you point me to where?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: The vocabulary in one ontology isn't sufficient for my purposes, so I need to use the vocabulary from another one.  For instance, FOAF, to my knowledge, doesn't provide me a way to state my organization, location, or role (which GoogleSnippets seems to think are required fields to be a valid person).  So I go and find a handy ontology, say the one that Google suggests, <a href=\"http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org</a>, which has these terms.  Now again I have the closely related problem of making sure that the two ontologies agree on what a person is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div typeof=\"foaf:Person\"&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"foaf:name\"&gt;Carl Boettiger&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span property=\"v:role\"&gt; graduate student &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>v:role</code> has it's own idea of what it belongs to, a <code>typeof=\"v:Person</code>. Do I need to add this <code>typeof</code> declaration as well?  Do I then need to do something to say it is the same as <code>foaf:Person</code>, and indeed that <code>v:role</code> and <code>foaf:name</code> both describe the same thing (me)?</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks for clarifying my befuddlement.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","button","onclick"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":107,"score":0,"question_id":13018636,"title":"javascript button onclick doesn't fire","body":"<p>So i have done this simple task but i don't see why this is not working?

Now I've got several questions:</p>\n\n<p>1.\nAm I right, that it's not possible to connect draggable elements with drop-areas?</p>\n\n<p>Example: You have 2 different kinds of elements you want to be able to drag and drop: Files and Text-Labels. Now if I give some div an DragOver-Handler and a Drop-Handler it will respond to both, files and text-labels. I'm looking for a simple possibility to only respond to a specific type of draggable items.</p>\n\n<p>A connected problem is the dropEffect cursor-style: At the moment I enable all possible drop-targets in the DragStart-Handler and disable all of them in the DragEnd-Handler (with \"disable\" I mean, that I remove all DragOver- and Drop-Handlers). If I wouldn't do so, it'll look like if you could drop a file on an element that should only react to text-labels.</p>\n\n<p>2.\nThe dropEffect cursor-style is a mess. In Firefox I don't get them at all, in Chrome it will give me a big \"plus\"-icon (even if I have removed the DragOver- and Drop-Handlers from an element)</p>\n\n<p>3.\nLast feature I am looking for is multi-select: Select multiple Text-Labels and then drag all of them at a time. Is this possible? My first idea was to create a new div and move all selected elements inside this div and then drag the newly created div. Seems pretty hackish and looks quite ugly ;-) </p>\n\n<p>I hope you guys have some answers for me.

Appreciate if anyone can provide guidance on this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt; \n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\"  href=\"jquery.mobile-1.2.0/demos/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.css\" /&gt;  \n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.mobile-1.2.0/demos/js/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.mobile-1.2.0/demos/docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.mobile-1.2.0/demos/js/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    $(document).ready(function () {\n        $.ajax(\"http://localhost:8098/CustomerService.svc/GetCustomerList\",\n            {\n                beforeSend: function (xhr) {\n                    // $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg();\n                },\n                complete: function () {\n                    // $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg();\n                },\n                contentType: 'application/json',\n                dataType: 'jsonp',\n                jsonp: 'callback',\n                type: 'GET',\n                error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {\n                    alert(xhr.status);\n                    alert(xhr.responseText);\n                    //alert(thrownError);\n                },\n                success: function (data) {\n                    var result = data.GetCustomerListResult;\n\n                    $.each(result, function (index, output) {\n                        $('#CustomerList').append('&lt;li data-theme=\"c\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"RewardMember_Find.html?CustomerNo=' + output.CustomerNo + '\" data-transition=\"slide\"&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;div style=\"text-align:center; width:80px; float:left;\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"images/' + output.PhotoImage + '\"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;div style=\"padding-left:85px; color:#575749;\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;' + output.CustomerLastName + ' ' + output.CustomerFirstName + '&lt;/h2&gt;' +\n                            '&lt;table style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:10px;width:100%;\"&gt;' +\n                                '&lt;tr style=\"text-align:left;\"&gt;' +\n                                    '&lt;td style=\"font-weight:bold; width:30%;\"&gt;Member Since: &lt;/td&gt;' +\n                                    '&lt;td style=\"padding-left:5px;color:#FF6600;\"&gt;' + output.StartDate + '&lt;/td&gt;' +\n                                '&lt;/tr&gt;' +\n                                '&lt;tr style=\"text-align:left;\"&gt;' +\n                                    '&lt;td style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Residential Loc: &lt;/td&gt;' +\n                                    '&lt;td style=\"text-padding-left:5px;color:#FF6600;\"&gt;' + output.ResidentialLocation + '&lt;/td&gt;' +\n                                '&lt;/tr&gt;' +\n                            '&lt;/table&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;/div&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;');\n                    });\n\n                    $('#CustomerList').listview('refresh');\n                }\n            });\n        });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"tags":["php","iphone","objective-c","ios","html5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":6,"view_count":105,"score":-5,"question_id":12993546,"title":"Port iOS app to a web app","body":"<p>so i have an iPhone app and i want to convert it into php coding or some other form of coding that will allow my game to be played on a my website, so that people can see what it is like, how can i do this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","html5","video","youtube"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":0,"question_id":13000706,"title":"Seeking forward in YouTube HTML5 video over Android WebView","body":"<p>I have an application that shows an HTML5 videoview over a WebView.

I thought I might be able to use \"items[i].src = ...\" or use setAttribute, but I can't get anything to work.</p>\n\n<p>I'm still fairly new to all this, so I'm possibly missing something very simple... so if anyone has an idea and could point me into a direction, I would really appreciate it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nEventually we came up with this solution which is pretty simple and straightforward</p>\n\n<pre><code>var videoPlaying = vd1.currentSrc;\nvar ext = videoPlaying.substr(videoPlaying.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\nvd1.src = \"jerryclips/Bild02\"+ext;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","html5","css3"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":12973187,"title":"is jquery animate() doesn't have 'transform': 'rotateY(-45deg)'","body":"<p>I am working with a sample code in which div's replacement/changing animation will show same as windows phone div scroll left animation</p>\n\n<p>I am using this code</p>\n\n<pre><code>   $this.stop().animate({'transform': 'rotateY(-45deg)',scrollLeft:200px},5000);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But with this code div's are replacing but with not rotation degree.. \nas a 3D view.</p>\n"},{"tags":["internet-explorer","html5","internet-explorer-9","html5-video"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1711,"score":2,"question_id":8008212,"title":"Why doesn't my poster image show in IE9 html5 Video","body":"<p>I have a html5 video on this page:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yellowtulipcomms.com/portfolio/global-public-speaking/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yellowtulipcomms.com/portfolio/global-public-speaking/</a></p>\n\n<p>Down the bottom of the 3 right hand images.</p>\n\n<p>Im using the following code</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;video class=\"video-js\" width=\"235\" height=\"185\" playbackRate=\"1\" poster=\"http://www.yellowtulipcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kimia-Namadchi-STILL.jpg\" controls=\"controls\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the videos underneath and the poster image just never shows in IE9 </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","internet-explorer","audio","web-audio"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":12971942,"title":"pcm data support in internet explorer","body":"<p>For playing audio PCM data in HTML5 there in WebAudio API ( Chrome..) ,( mozSetup ,mozWriteAudio  in firefox ) .In these API Either We can append PCM data ( firefox ) and or give timer for play data ( noteon function in chrome ) .

I'm not a native speaker. I hope I can explain myself never the less! Further more, I read that I should show I made some efforts to solve the given problem myself. To show this my post became relatively long.</p>\n\n<h2>What I want to do:</h2>\n\n<p>I am new (three weeks) to javascript and I try to build a pool billiard table via html5 canvas and javascript. In the end a user should be able to present a certain playing situation on the virtual pool tabe by dragging the sixteen balls around. I found a lot of hints here on stackoverflow concerning paths and drag &amp; drop.</p>\n\n<h2>What already works:</h2>\n\n<p>By the while the circles almost look like pool balls and I'm able to move them around with the mouse. So far so good.</p>\n\n<h2>What the problem is:</h2>\n\n<p>Certainly pool balls collide in reality and don't overlap. Concerning the collision detection I found a helpful post which told me to do this using the Pythagorean therm a*a + b*b = c*c. I understand this concept. What I definitely don't understand is where I have to implement the detection within my code. In my script there is a function (moveBall00(e)) which calculates the new x- and y-coordinates if the balls are dragged around (dragok = true). But how can a calculation of the distance between the balls be made while the new coordinates of the dragged ball are calculated at the same time? This could easily be newbie-question!</p>\n\n<p>I tried this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>new variable “x”</p>\n\n<p>var x = true;</p></li>\n<li><p>new function to detect the distance between the balls</p>\n\n<p>function collision() {\n    if((Math.pow(bp[1][0] - bp[1][1], 2)) + (Math.pow(bp[2][0] - bp[2][1], 2)) &lt;= 576 ) {\n        x = false;\n    }\n}</p></li>\n<li><p>call “collision()” every 10 millisecounds</p>\n\n<p>(function isIntersecting() {\n    return setInterval(collision, 10);\n})();</p></li>\n<li><p>only drag the ball if “x=true”</p>\n\n<p>function moveBall00(e) {\n    if (dragok &amp;&amp; x) {\n        bp[1][0] = e.pageX - canvas.offsetLeft;\n        bp[2][0] = e.pageY - canvas.offsetTop;\n    }\n}</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The result is that the circles (balls) overlaped until they came to a rest. They overlaped the more the quicker I dragged the ball. This seams to be a first-after-problem?!</p>\n\n<p>For experienced developers it is most certain a walk through the park but not for me.</p>\n\n<p>I'm the insistent type and will learn to do this stuff in javascript but at the moment I have no clue on how to solve the mentioned problem.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any help with this an will post the future result here!</p>\n\n<h2>Here is what I did so far:</h2>\n\n<p>(To simplify it only the white ball is drawable.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Collision detection&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n\n    &lt;body&gt;\n\n            &lt;canvas id=\"pooltable\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\"&gt;This text is displayed if your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas&lt;/canvas&gt;\n\n        &lt;script&gt;\n\n            var canvas;\n            var ctx;\n            var width = 1200;\n            var height = 660;\n            var dragok = false;\n\n            var bp = new Array();\n                // color of balls \"ballColor\"\n                bp[0] = new Array(\"rgba(255,255,255,1)\",\"rgba(231,214,8,1)\");\n                // x-position of balls \"xBallPosition\"\n                bp[1] = new Array(20,50);\n                // y-position of balls \"yBallPosition\"\n                bp[2] = new Array(50,50);\n                // color of stripes \"stripe\"\n                bp[3] = new Array(\"rgba(255,255,255,0)\",\"rgba(231,214,8,1)\");\n                // color of stripe strokes \"stripeStroke\"\n                bp[4] = new Array(\"rgba(255,255,255,0)\",\"rgba(231,214,8,1)\");\n                // ball numbers \"ballNumber\"\n                bp[5] = new Array(\" \",\"1\");\n                // position of ball numbers \"positionBallNumber\"\n                bp[6] = new Array();\n\n            function init() {\n                canvas = document.getElementById(\"pooltable\");\n                ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n                return setInterval(draw, 1);\n            }\n\n            function clear() {\n                ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);\n            }\n\n            function rect(x,y,w,h) {\n                ctx.beginPath();\n                ctx.rect(x,y,w,h);\n                ctx.closePath();\n                ctx.fill();\n            }\n\n            function ball(ballColor, xBallPosition, yBallPosition, ballRadius, angle, stripe, stripeStroke, circleRadius, ballNumber, positionBallNumber) {\n\n                ctx.fillStyle = ballColor;\n                ctx.shadowBlur = 5;\n                ctx.shadowColor = \"rgba(0,0,0,1)\";\n                ctx.beginPath();\n                ctx.arc(xBallPosition, yBallPosition, ballRadius, angle, Math.PI * 2, true);\n                ctx.closePath();\n                ctx.fill();\n\n                ctx.fillStyle = stripe;\n                ctx.strokeStyle = stripeStroke;\n                ctx.shadowColor = \"rgba(0,0,0,0)\";\n                ctx.beginPath();\n                ctx.moveTo(xBallPosition -

To produce sound effects for a simple game, I created a class as follows. I created an AudioContext, loaded sound data into SoundBuffers, and when the sound needed to be played, created an AudioBufferSourceNode via which to play the data stored in the buffers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Sfx {\n  AudioContext audioContext;\n  List&lt;Map&gt; soundList;\n  int soundFiles;\n\n  Sfx() {\n    audioContext = new AudioContext();\n    soundList = new List&lt;Map&gt;();\n    var soundsToLoad = [\n      {\"name\": \"MISSILE\", \"url\": \"SFX/missile.wav\"},\n      {\"name\": \"EXPLOSION\", \"url\": \"SFX/explosion.wav\"}\n    ];\n    soundFiles = soundsToLoad.length;\n\n    for (Map sound in soundsToLoad) {\n      initSound(sound);\n    }\n  }\n\n  bool allSoundsLoaded() =&gt; (soundFiles == 0);\n\n  void initSound(Map soundMap) {\n    HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();\n    req.open('GET', soundMap[\"url\"], true);\n    req.responseType = 'arraybuffer';\n    req.on.load.add((Event e) {\n      audioContext.decodeAudioData(\n        req.response,\n        (var buffer) {\n            // successful decode\n            print(\"...${soundMap[\"name\"]} loaded...\");\n            soundList.add({\"name\": soundMap[\"name\"], \"buffer\": buffer});\n            soundFiles--;\n        },\n        (var error) {\n          print(\"error loading ${soundMap[\"name\"]}\");\n        }\n      );\n    });\n    req.send();\n  }\n\n  void sfx(AudioBuffer buffer) {\n    AudioBufferSourceNode source = audioContext.createBufferSource();\n    source.connect(audioContext.destination, 0, 0);\n    source.buffer = buffer;\n    source.start(0);\n  }\n\n  void playSound(String sound) {\n    for (Map m in soundList) {\n      print(m);\n      if (m[\"name\"] == sound) {\n        sfx(m[\"buffer\"]);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(The sound effects are in a folder \"SFX\". Now that I look at the code, there are probably a million better ways to organise the data, but that's besides the point right now.) I am able to play sound effects by creating an instance of Sfx and calling the method playSound. </p>\n\n<p>e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import('dart:html');\n\n#source('sfx.dart');\n\nSfx sfx;\nvoid main() {\n  sfx = new Sfx();\n  window.on.keyUp.add((KeyboardEvent keX) {\n    sfx.playSound(\"MISSILE\");\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Edit: added code to play sound when a key is hit.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is: although with the dart2js Javascript, the sound effects play as expected in Safari, when they are played in Dartium or (with the dart2js Javascript) in Chrome, they are distorted. (In Firefox, there are even worse problems!)</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything obvious that I have neglected to do or that I need to take into account? Otherwise, are there any references or tutorials, preferably in a Dart context, that might help?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","html5","appmobi","app-hub"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":11926809,"title":"appMobi iOS build failure \"An error occured while building the application.

In short, you've got to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTML 5 vs. HTML 4</li>\n<li>Large screens vs. small screens</li>\n<li>Touch-based input vs. mouse-based input</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, it's theoretically possible to build a single application that utilizes the latest in responsive design (to handle large AND small screens), utilizes the latest HTML 5 capabilities but degrades gracefully (to support the millions of users who are stuck on IE 6, 7, and 8), and somehow supports both touch input (huge hit areas, no hover/rollover behaviors, pinch-to-zoom, etc.) <strong>and</strong> mouse-based input.</p>\n\n<p>However, in my opinion, this requires a <strong>TON</strong> of additional code and is <strong>nightmarishly</strong> difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative - what I <em>generally</em> tend to recommend - is a Flash version for desktop users, and a <strong>HTML5/Touch</strong>-<em>only</em> version for mobile/iPad users.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>huge</strong> downside of this is that you've got two totally distinct sets of code. The upside is that you can create the optimal experience for both sets of users (i.e., you don't need to write code to support sub-optimal experiences for poor IE6/7/8 desktop users who are otherwise stuck with HTML4), and you can safely assume that mobile users are using a VERY current, VERY capable HTML5 compliant browser.</p>\n\n<p>Is my thinking correct?

Any suggestions for this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ajax","html5","xmlhttprequest-level2"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":12927365,"title":"XMLHttpRequest.addEventListener vs XMLHttpRequest.upload.addEventListener","body":"<p>What is the difference between the this code block:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", uploadProgress, false);\nxhr.addEventListener(\"load\", uploadComplete, false);\nxhr.addEventListener(\"error\", uploadFailed, false);\nxhr.addEventListener(\"abort\", uploadCanceled, false);\n\nxhr.open(\"POST\", \"upload_url\");\nxhr.send(some_form_data);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", uploadProgress, false);\nxhr.upload.addEventListener(\"load\", uploadComplete, false);\nxhr.upload.addEventListener(\"error\", uploadFailed, false);\nxhr.upload.addEventListener(\"abort\", uploadCanceled, false);\n\nxhr.open(\"POST\", \"upload_url\");\nxhr.send(some_form_data);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've seen both implementations in blogs and other SO posts, but no one explains why they use one over the other.

As far as I can tell, I can only find examples where the text and the background expand but none with a separation of functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html5","animation","diagram"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":95,"score":-2,"question_id":12919143,"title":"How did they create this fancy diagram?","body":"<p>I found a fancy diagram (with animation) <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYTimes Fancy Diagram</a> on a NYTimes webpage.\nDoes anybody know about such diagram, the underlying techs and possible tools please?

Before I move to the actual development phase, I want to be sure that my current strategy will not turn out to be a bust. </p>\n\n<p>I first thought about using html5 app cache but after doing some tests I found that it seems to not cache the server side operations but the actual html that is rendered (Please correct me if I'm wrong). This will not work because the rendered html depends upon who is currently logged in. From my tests, it always rendered the html as if the last person that logged in (online) is logging in.</p>\n\n<p>My current strategy is this:\nI cache only the login page and an offline (.html) page to correspond to each aspx page that will need to be available offline. Every successful login (online) results in creating or updating Web SQL Database or IndexDB (depending on browser) with all data needed for that person to operate offline including a table that will be used for login credentials. In this way the only requirement for logging in offline is logging in with your login credentials at least one time.</p>\n\n<p>My concern is that I am overcomplicating it.

It sounds simple enough but I can't get it cooperate.  I have a page with many buttons, some directly accessible, some buttons are accessed via various accordions and tabs.  Many of the copy targets contain dynamic data, some of which are inserted via ajax.  Also many of the sections are collapsible. If the flash overlay that <code>.zclip()</code> attaches to the button is present when the section closes, then it causes the animation to glitch.   </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to approach this from several different ways:  </p>\n\n<p>Attaching <code>.zclip()</code> all the button elements, and then refreshing the page at set interval.  While it does capture the dynamic data, its performance is horrible.  </p>\n\n<p>Attaching and removing <code>.zclip()</code> based on <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events, as well as <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code>.  When attaching this way, all the events are firing many times per second causing multiple flash overlays to be bound to one button.  </p>\n\n<p>Attaching and removing <code>.zclip()</code> based on <code>.hover()</code> and <code>.hoverIntent()</code>.  While this behaves better than the above attempt and captures the dynamic data, the events fire way to much still. I have tried doing a <code>.hover()</code> on the parent section and attaching <code>.zclip()</code> to all the buttons in that section.  That works but its performance is terrible.</p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that there is an easy solution to this, but I just cant figure it out.  I can bind <code>.zclip()</code> via <code>.click()</code> and it will attach to a button.  I can remove <code>.zclip()</code> via its <code>afterFunction</code> parameter.  I cant figure out how to pass an additional <code>click</code> event to the button and fire <code>.zclip()</code> once its attached.  It will work, but the button has to be clicked twice.  Once to activate it, the one to fire and remove it.  I was thinking maybe the additional <code>click</code> event needs to be sent to the flash overlay and not to the button again.

I'm running into a problem wherein large scroll areas cause the elements that are offscreen to appear after a delay when I scroll down to them.</p>\n\n<p>What I mean by that is, if I have a row of images (or even a div with a gradient) that is offscreen, when I scroll down (or up) to it, the <strong>expected behavior</strong> is for the element to appear on screen as I am scrolling to it.</p>\n\n<p>However, what I'm seeing is that the element <strong>does not appear</strong> until I lift my finger off the screen and the scroller finishes all its animations.</p>\n\n<p>This is causing a super noticeable problem for me, making the whole thing look choppy, although it is not. I'm guessing the iPad Safari is trying to do something to save memory. Is there any way in which I can prevent this choppy-ness from happening. Additionally, I would also appreciate if anyone can shed light on what the iPad Safari is actually trying to do.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a ton for all your help, in advance! :-)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: Complete answer to question. The answer I've selected helped me get to the complete solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To the one who answered my question, thank you!\nYour answer and the article you linked out to gave me a lead to try something with CSS.</p>\n\n<p>So, I was using translate3d before. It produced unwanted results. Basically, it would chop off and NOT RENDER elements that were offscreen, until I interacted with them. So, basically, in landscape orientation, half of my site that was offscreen was not being shown. This is a iPad web app, owing to which I was in a fix.</p>\n\n<p>Applying translate3d to relatively positioned elements solved the problem for those elements, but other elements stopped rendering, once offscreen. The elements that I couldn't interact with (artwork) would never render again, unless I reloaded the page.</p>\n\n<p>The complete solution:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*:not(html) {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, although this might not be the most \"efficient\" solution, it was the only one that works. Mobile Safari does not render the elements that are offscreen, or sometimes renders erratically, when using <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code>. Unless a translate3d is applied to all other elements that might go offscreen owing to that scroll, those elements will be chopped off after scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>So, thanks again, and hope this helps some other lost soul.
