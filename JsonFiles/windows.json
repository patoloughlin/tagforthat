The hardware device is responsible sending out precise periodic messages onto various networks that it, in turn, connects too.  Inside the hardware device I have a couple Microchip dsPICs.  There are two modes of operation.  </p>\n\n<p>One scenario is where send simple \"jobs\" down to the dsPICs that, in turn, can send out the precise messages with .001ms accuracy.  This architecture is not ideal for more complex messaging where we need to send a periodic packet that changes based on events going on within the PC application.  So we have a second mode of operation where our PC application will send the periodic messages and the dsPICs simply convert and transmit in response.  All this, by the way, is transparent to the end user of our software.  Our hardware device is a test tool used in the automotive field.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we use a USB to serial chip from FTDI and the FTDI Windows drivers to interface the hardware to our PC software.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that in mode two where we send messages from the PC, the best we are able to achieve is around 1ms on average hardware range.  We are subjected to Windows kernel pre-emption.  I've tried a number of \"tricks\" to improve things such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Making sure our reader &amp; writer threads live on seperate CPU affinities when possible.</li>\n<li>Increasing the thread priority of the writer while reducing that of the reader.</li>\n<li>Informing the user to turn off screen saver and other applications when using our software.</li>\n<li>Replacing createthread calls with CreateTimerQueueTimer calls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All our software is written in C/C++.  I'm very familiar and comfortable with advanced Windows programming; such as IO Completions, Overlapped I/O, lockless thread queues (really a design strategy), sockets, threads, semaphores, etc...</p>\n\n<p>However, I know nothing about Windows driver development.  I've read through a few papers on KMDF vs. UDMF vs. WDM.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping a seasoned Windows kernel mode driver developer will respond here... </p>\n\n<p>The next rev. of our hardware has the option to replace the FTDI chip and use either the dsPIC's USB interface or, possibly, port the open source Linux FTDI stuff to Windows and continue to use the FTDI chip within our custom driver.  I think by going to a kernel mode driver on the PC side, I can establish a kernel driver that can send out periodic messages at more precise intervals without preemption and/or possibly taking advantage of DMA.</p>\n\n<p>We have a competitor in our business who I think does exactly something similar with their tools.  As far as I know, user space applications can not schedule a thread any better than 1ms.  We currently use timeGetTime in a thread.  I've experiemented with timer queues (via CreateTimerQueueTimer) with no real improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Is a WDM the correct approach to achieve more precise timing?</p>\n\n<p>Our competitor some how is achieveing very precise timing from Windows driven signals to their hardware and they do load a kernel driver (.sys) and their device runs over USB2.0 as does ours.</p>\n\n<p>If WDM is the way to go, can I get some advise on what kernel functions I should be studying for setting up the timings?\nThanks for reading</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","build-automation","winddk","umdf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":1,"question_id":9066333,"title":"Different library paths for different build environments","body":"<p>I'm developing a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463294\" rel=\"nofollow\">UMDF-driver</a>.

This single thread sits inside <code>poll()</code> most of the time (I've already converted this to <code>select()</code>, on Windows), the network thread only waking up when there's incoming network data.  When a client command arrives, the network thread fires the command off to a worker thread to actually perform work on the back-end, and then goes back to listening for more incoming commands.  Commands are asynchronous -- multiple commands can come in on one socket, one right after the next.  At any one time, there can be dozens of outstanding commands on a single connection, all being worked on in various worker threads.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that when the worker thread wants to send response data, the network thread is probably asleep inside <code>poll()</code> at the time that the worker thread is trying to send its result.  The network thread has to wait for <code>poll()</code> to time out (or another packet to be received) before it will notice that there's new outbound data queued up to be sent.</p>\n\n<p>Under unix, I deal with this by including a pipe amongst the descriptors being watched by <code>poll()</code>, and when a worker thread has outbound data to send, it also writes a byte of data into the pipe to wake up the network thread.

(How would the call of SuspendThread know when the target thread was actually suspended?)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <em>I lied.</em> I said this was for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>Well, the strange truth is that I don't see this behavior under Windows XP 64 (at least not in the last week and I don't really know what happened before that)... but we have been testing this Windows application under Wine on Ubuntu 10.x.  The <a href=\"http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/ntdll/thread.c#L766\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wine source for the guts of GetThreadContext</a> contains\nan Access Denied return response on line 819 when an attempt to grab the thread state fails for some reason. I'm guessing, but it appears that Wine GetThreadStatus believes that a thread just might not be accessible repeatedly.  Why that would be true after a SuspendThead is beyond me, but there's the code.  Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: <em>I lied again</em>.  I said we only saw the behavior on Wine.  Nope... we have now found a Vista Ultimate system that seems to produce the same error (again, rarely).   So, it appears that Wine and Windows agree on an obscure case. It also appears that the mere enabling of the Sysinternals Process monitor program aggravates the situation and causes the problem to appear on Windows XP 64; I suspect a Heisenbug.  (The Process Monitor\ndoesn't even exist on the Wine-tasting (:-) machine or the XP 64 system I use for development).</p>\n\n<p>What on earth is it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: Sept 15 2010.  I've added careful checking to the error return status, without otherwise disturbing the code, for SuspendThread, ResumeThread, and GetContext.  I haven't seen <em>any</em> hint of this behavior on Windows systems since I did that.  Haven't gotten back to the Wine experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2010: Strange.  It seems that if I compile this under VisualStudio 2005, it fails on Windows Vista and 7, but not earlier OSes.  If I compile under VisualStudio 2010, it doesn't fail anywhere.  One might point a finger at VisualStudio2005, but I'm suspicious of a location-sensitivve problem, and different optimizers in VS 2005 and VS 2010 place the code a slightly different places.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2012: Saga continues.  We see this failure on a number of XP and Windows 7 machines, at a pretty low rate (once every several thousand runs).  Our Suspend activities are applied to threads that mostly execute pure computational code but that sometimes make calls into Windows.    I don't recall seeing this issue when the PC of the thread was in our computational code.   Of course, I can't see the PC of the thread when it hangs because GetContext won't give it to me, so I can't directly confirm that the problem only happens when executing system calls.  But, all our system calls are channeled through one point, and so far the evidence is that point was executed when we get the hang. So the indirect evidence suggests GetContext on a thread only fails if a system call is being executed by that thread.    I haven't had the energy to build a critical experiment to test this hypothesis yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","icons","file-type"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":13210560,"title":"How do I assign an icon to a custom file type?","body":"<p>Is there any way to do so in C or C++ (I know that it can be done in C#, so if you know how to, it'd also help!)?</p>\n\n<p>What I want is a way to, automatically and through my own application, associate a custom file extension with a custom icon.

This support is always disabled by default, but may be\nenabled/disabled via the /V command line switch to CMD.EXE.  See CMD /?\n\nDelayed environment variable expansion is useful for getting around\nthe limitations of the current expansion which happens when a line\nof text is read, not when it is executed.  The following example\ndemonstrates the problem with immediate variable expansion:\n\n    set VAR=before\n    if \"%VAR%\" == \"before\" (\n        set VAR=after\n        if \"%VAR%\" == \"after\" @echo If you see this, it worked\n    )\n\nwould never display the message, since the %VAR% in BOTH IF statements\nis substituted when the first IF statement is read, since it logically\nincludes the body of the IF, which is a compound statement.  So the\nIF inside the compound statement is really comparing \"before\" with\n\"after\" which will never be equal.  Similarly, the following example\nwill not work as expected:\n\n    set LIST=\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST=%LIST% %i\n    echo %LIST%\n\nin that it will NOT build up a list of files in the current directory,\nbut instead will just set the LIST variable to the last file found.\nAgain, this is because the %LIST% is expanded just once when the\nFOR statement is read, and at that time the LIST variable is empty.\nSo the actual FOR loop we are executing is:\n\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST= %i\n\nwhich just keeps setting LIST to the last file found.\n\nDelayed environment variable expansion allows you to use a different\ncharacter (the exclamation mark) to expand environment variables at\nexecution time.  If delayed variable expansion is enabled, the above\nexamples could be written as follows to work as intended:\n\n    set VAR=before\n    if \"%VAR%\" == \"before\" (\n        set VAR=after\n        if \"!VAR!\" == \"after\" @echo If you see this, it worked\n    )\n\n    set LIST=\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST=!LIST! %i\n    echo %LIST%\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I tried using the <code>!</code> sign, still it does not work for me.

How does my standalone software know which one to communicate with?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I already have my standalone software running and open the 3rd party software, does the plugin somehow have to register or find my standalone software to communicate with it?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I already have the 3rd party software running and then open my standalone software does it have to scan for the plugin to see if its running or how does it find it?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've done a search on the topic on SO but didn't see many questions for C++ specifically and most of them didn't have many answers or weren't very clear or didn't specifically refer to software communication with a plugin for a 3rd party program.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows","microsoft-metro","store"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":1,"question_id":13203236,"title":"Setting periodic Live tile update","body":"<p>I have been developing a windows store app, where I need something like</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Periodically call a function that performs a http request and returns the response string</li>\n<li>Update the Live tile with the returned string</li>\n<li>These should happen only when the app is suspended/navigated away to start screen or something</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(I have written the function to perform and return http request)</p>\n\n<p>I referred to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh868228.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> link but I do not know where to put those code in my program.

These alarms then pile up, and get all sent at once, when the program is finally restarted. This makes these alarms pretty useless, because by the time you restart the program, you already know that something is wrong with the system.</p>\n\n<p>The solution that I'm aiming at is that Windows Task Scheduler could every night kill and then restart the program with the help of a simple batch file.

I finally figured out that the browser seemed to not be understanding the font correctly. If I used websafe fonts like arial and georgia, the issues went away.

The weirdest part about this is that it only happens <i>intermittently</i>. Sometimes the page displays fine and sometimes it looks crazy.

I'm writing a kernel-mode Windows driver, that gets notified when a kernel-mode DLL (or other executable module) is loaded. In some situations I have to intercept the DLL entry point routine. That is, override it so that my routine is called first, and then I may pass control to the original entry point.</p>\n\n<p>On 32-bit (x86 to be exact) there was no problem to do that. I get the module base mapping address, which actually begins with the standard PE header (used by Windows executables). There there's an RVA (address relative to the image base) of the DLL entry point. I just override it by the address of my routine minus the module base address. Voila!</p>\n\n<p>Now, the things are more complicated in 64-bit. The problem is that RVAs are still 32-bit integers. Such RVAs cover the address range starting from the image base address and ending with 4GB offset. There's no problem to reference any symbol inside the same executable module (assume it doesn't exceed 4GB size), however this imposes problems for cross-module interception. Naturally my executable module and the one that I'm trying to hook don't have to fall into the same 4GB range, hence there's a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Temporarily I solved this by overriding the original routine prolog code by an unconditional <code>jmp</code> into my code. This takes 12 bytes on 64-bit platform. Then, in order to call the original code from my routine I restore the overridden 12 bytes (means - I save them before overwriting).</p>\n\n<p>So far - no problems. But now the things are changing, and I'll have to support multi-threaded access to the entry point routine (please don't ask why, it's related to multi-session DLL loaded into a so-called \"user space\", separate for each terminal session).</p>\n\n<p>One of the solutions is to use a global lock, but I'd like to avoid this.</p>\n\n<p>I know about the so-called \"trampoline functions\", but I'd like to avoid this as well. Doing this requires a run-time decoding of the function prolog code to properly identify the instruction boundary and possible branching.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I thought about another idea. What if I could find some \"unneeded\" portion of the original DLL, which is at least 12 bytes length (size of <code>mov RAX addr</code> + <code>jmp RAX</code>). Then this portion could be overridden by <code>jmp</code> into my hands. Then the entry point RVA could be set to this portion!</p>\n\n<p>All that is needed for this to work is the appropriate portion that can be overwritten. I suppose there is such a possibility, since the PE header contains a lot of historical fields that are no more used for decades.</p>\n\n<p>Is this idea worth trying, or is this a well-known technique? Andy other suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","windows"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":490,"score":1,"question_id":3997428,"title":"How Can I get the Ip address of System","body":"<p>How can  I get the IP address of the system. </p>\n\n<p>I want the Ip address as I can see after doing <code>ipconfig</code> or <code>/bin/ifconfig</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","windows-8","winjs","appbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":13190431,"title":"Windows 8 App Bar By default in app development","body":"<p>I want to create an app bar for my javascript app , as we know we see app bar when pressing right click , but I want it to be show by default , without right click. here is my html code</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;div id=\"appbar\" data-win-control=\"WinJS.UI.AppBar\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Commands for show/hide --&gt;\n    &lt;button data-win-control=\"WinJS.UI.AppBarCommand\" \n            data-win-options=\"{id:'showHideButton', label:'Show/Hide Picker', icon:'view'}\"&gt;\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>thank you</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","web-services","dns"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":17,"score":-1,"question_id":13192225,"title":"How to configure DNS server For resolving The web servers address and Their name","body":"<p>I have configured my DNS server and active directory in my domain, but now i have installed a new Web server in my domain when im accessing the website through the IP address for example <a href=\"http://XXX.YYY.ZZZ:80\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://XXX.YYY.ZZZ:80</a>  then it is getting aces but  now i want to aces it through the name, PLZ help me what changes i want to make in my DNS server for this.</p>\n\n<p>Note my Domain is registered.    </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","windows","eclipse","java-ee"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":88,"score":0,"question_id":11189013,"title":"Eclipse shutdown after start error due to wrong username or password","body":"<p>I am getting error <strong>Wrong username or password</strong> when I try to start Eclipse.

I know that RMI's SecurityManager forbids file I/O by default, so I've created a policy file for my server that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>grant codeBase \"file:///C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/bin/-\" {\n    //Giving the server permission to make connections\n    permission java.net.SocketPermission \"127.0.0.1:1024-\", \"connect, resolve\";\n    permission java.net.SocketPermission \"127.0.0.1:1024-\", \"accept, resolve\";\n    //File I/O permissions\n    permission java.io.FilePermission \"C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/-\", \"read,write,delete\";\n    permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"user.dir\", \"read\";\n    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"readFileDescriptor\";\n    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"modifyThread\";\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Note that the name of my Eclipse project is \"authmatch\", and this is running on Windows). In my Eclipse run configuration, I enable this policy file with the following VM flags:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:///C:/Users/Edward/Documents/College/CS197/authmatch/bin/\n-Djava.security.policy=server.policy\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that the policy file is being parsed and loaded because if I introduce a syntax error in server.policy Java complains about it (\"error parsing file\") when my application runs. However, the security manager seems to be somehow ignoring the permissions I grant in my policy, because when I run the application I get this error: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Exception in thread \"main\" java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"smalltest.txt\" \"read\")\n    at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkRead(Unknown Source)\n    at java.io.RandomAccessFile.&lt;init&gt;(Unknown Source)\n    at etremel.authmatch.text.TextFileFormatter.&lt;init&gt;(TextFileFormatter.java:39)\n    at etremel.authmatch.source.PatternMatcherSource.main(PatternMatcherSource.java:302)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the file I'm asking it to read (smalltest.txt) is in the \"authmatch\" project directory, and I explicitly gave my application permission to read that directory with the line</p>\n\n<pre><code>permission java.io.FilePermission \"C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/-\", \"read,write,delete\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>why is it still insisting that it doesn't have read permission for the file? I suspect this may be a Windows issue because I have the same project running on a Linux computer and a similar policy file allows it to read from its local project directory just fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>I ran the server with <code>-Djava.security.debug=access,failure</code> and it generated a bunch of debug messages while parsing the policy file. You can see the entire log at <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/ijjg3FC9\" rel=\"nofollow\">this pastebin</a>, but there seem to be two important parts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>access: access allowed (\"java.security.SecurityPermission\" \"getPolicy\")\naccess: access allowed (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"C:\\Users\\Edward\\Documents\\College\\CS197\\authmatch\\bin\" \"read\")\naccess: domain that failed ProtectionDomain  (file:/C:/Users/Edward/Documents/College/CS197/authmatch/bin/ &lt;no signer certificates&gt;)\n sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@74ba86ef\n &lt;no principals&gt;\n java.security.Permissions@7a8a44a6 (\n (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"\\C:\\Users\\Edward\\Documents\\College\\CS197\\authmatch\\bin\\-\" \"read\")\n (\"java.net.SocketPermission\" \"localhost:1024-\" \"listen,resolve\")\n ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and much later:</p>\n\n<pre><code>access: access allowed (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"C:\\Users\\Edward\\Documents\\College\\CS197\\authmatch\\bin\\etremel\\authmatch\\text\\TextFileFormatter.class\" \"read\")\naccess: access allowed (\"java.util.PropertyPermission\" \"user.dir\" \"read\")\naccess: access denied (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"smalltest.txt\" \"read\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like there's some kind of \"domain protection\" failure because my codebase isn't signed, but I thought it was acceptable to specify a security policy without a signature using the <code>grant codeBase</code> setup. More puzzling, it doesn't look like it ever reads the FilePermission for the root authmatch directory, just the authmatch/bin directory. Then it concludes that it should deny access to \"smalltest.txt,\" but it never resolves the full directory path of that file. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, the same project and policy work fine on Linux.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4538,"score":0,"question_id":398571,"title":"Need to Run Windows Security Dialog Box from Command Line","body":"<p>You know, what you normally get when typing ctrl-alt-del or ctrl-alt-end.

When I copy the inf, sys and exe to another machine, the sample does NOT monitor. Through traceview output, I can see that on the second machine, DriverEntry() is not called, therefore the flow controls are never set up. The two machines are running the release version of Win8. It doesn't appear to be an issue with my new code, since the driver works fine on machine #1, and it doesn't appear to be a signature problem because when I turn off signature enforcement on machine #2 I still have the problem.

I have followed the instructions here (http://qjson.sourceforge.net/get_it/windows.html) for building with visual studio and I also tried building qjson with the qt creator IDE - both of them appear to compile correctly, I get no errors, and each process generates a dll file. But when I try to link to the generated dll file from my app, it won't build. It gives me this error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file: cannot read at 0x2C0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are my statements from the .pro file from when I tried to build qjson using qt creator.

When I compiled qjson using cmake and visual studio, I got no errors and a file called qjson.dll (instead of qjson0.dll). I moved this into my qjson folder within my app's working directory and tried to link to that. Got the exact same error about a corrupt file. Here is my lib statement for that. </p>\n\n<pre><code>LIBS += \"$$PWD/qjson/qjson.dll\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have been able to compile the qjson code statically into my app on Windows XP and on Mac and my json file is parsed correctly. But then if I try to move this build to a windows 7 computer it won't launch. If I try to build statically on Windows 7 it will finish the build process sucessfuly, then it will run, but it crashes as soon as I try to load a json file by moving it into the application's search path.

Whereas if I link dynamically that means  I am telling qt where to find the already compiled qjson.dll file, and I probably need to include it in the build directory. Either way is fine, I just need to get something to run.   </p>\n\n<p>The same json file runs fine on windows XP and on mac, so I don't think that is corrupted. If I build statically the app can't find a json file to read, the app launches. I have tried this with qt 4.7.4 (this version works on XP and Windows) and I have also tried qt 4.8.1 with the same result. Could it be that I compiled qt wrong? I swear I even saw it work once with a json file, and then it would crash every time.</p>\n\n<p>Any help at all is very appreciated. Could someone even please just send me a comppiled qjson dll file that is not corrupted so I can try linking to that?

And the second menu is 'edit' which means the operation to the content, mostly some edit to the content, but the 'find' method is also placed there though it do nothing of an 'edit' behaviour (leave the 'replace' alone). And the third menu is view, which changes the layout. The fourth is most strange, 'insert'. The insert operation in my view in a kind of edit which changes the content of the file.  And the most unacceptable menu is 'Table', and it's 'insert table' got duplicated with the order in 'insert' menu, which make the logic even more sensiless.

</p>\n\n<p>Since people seemed confused about my question here's a more detailed explanation:</p>\n\n<p>When executing the code below (supplied by Baz), I am able to drag files and drop them on to the text box, when I drag a file from most locations on my machine, the window appears like this -></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NQkG5.png\" alt=\"Working Drag\"></p>\n\n<p>The cursor indicates that I can drop, and when I release the mouse the <code>drop(DropTargetEvent event)</code> method is invoked.</p>\n\n<p>Now when I do the same thing, but take a file from explorer that is on a DVD in my optical drive then it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HWgMc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Indicating that the drop is not allowed, and when I release the mouse the <code>drop(DropTargetEvent event)</code> method is NOT invoked. </p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting that I am able to drop the same DVD files in to a folder in the eclipse navigator, indicating that this isn't a machine specific issue, there must be something different in the eclipse trees that allows it but I can't see it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>package

(What role does this new adapter play that makes it the adapter that any network aware program should choose to consult for internet access?)</li>\n<li>If a real internet connection is available on a node, this would be shared by that node to other nodes on the mesh through the Babel implementation</li>\n<li>Whether or not internet is available from any node, not sure what services could be hosted within the mesh itself.  How is resource/domain name resolution provided?</li>\n<li>If the current node has internet, any requests to internet resources would go directly through it and any resources within the mesh would go through Babel.  If direct internet is lost by that node, all traffic would go through Babel.  Does this need to be programmed for or does the windows network stack know how to deal with this, assuming our program is written correctly?</li>\n<li>Since this is Windows 7+, IPv6 is a legitimate choice for addressing nodes in the mesh, however, not all internet connectivity is expected to support IPv6.

Instead, they might look for other's wireless networks when theirs are down and find the SSID \"Free Emergency Mesh WiFi\" and connect.

Today while changing the way my player character class works, I've come up against a very puzzling problem. The following code forms part of my logic allowing the player to fire bullets. The control variables, b_canFire and b_shouldFire (I plan to rename these to make more sense), are set elsewhere in the class to allow this function to execute when the user presses a key. </p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if(b_canFire &amp;&amp; b_shouldFire)\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Does not work\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Does not work\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I step through this code using my debugger, it becomes aparrent that the values of b_canFire and b_shouldFire are not being changed to false by the assignments inside the if statement. However, if I change the code to the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if((b_canFire) &amp;&amp; (b_shouldFire))\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Works\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Works\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if(b_canFire == true &amp;&amp; b_shouldFire == true)\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Works\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Works\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suddenly the assignments work.

I added some code to check the FPS in windows(sending current fps to log file when a button is pressed) and it was running at 20-30 FPS with shaders disabled.</p>\n\n<p>I'm VERY confused by this because none of the code I'm using is actually DIFFERENT, the only differences are in how I use openGL: in windows I use GLEW to handle my extensions while in linux I use #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES.\nI've looked around and it would seem as though the code I'm using SHOULD work on both linux and windows, although I'm having these very strange effects whenever I run my program in windows.</p>\n\n<p>The problems would be: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>View seems to be stuck in an orthographic projection(when it's set up to be perspective)</li>\n<li>Shaders, Blending, Framebuffers/VBO's, Textures, are not working.</li>\n<li>Extreme delay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only places I think I could be doing something wrong would be in Initializing SDL/OpenGL/GLEW .</p>\n\n<p>I'm directly using GLEW, as the libraries I was originally linking to were giving me problems.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//SAE_GL.h\n/**Header Guard**/\n#ifndef __SAE_OPENGL__\n#define __SAE_OPENGL__\n\n/**Include**/\n///gl extensions\n#ifdef __WIN32\n    #define GLEW_STATIC\n    #include \"GL/glew.h\"\n#else\n    #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES\n#endif\n\n///opengl\n#include \"GL/gl.h\"\n#include \"GL/glu.h\"\n\n///SAE Dependencies\n#include \"SAE_Core.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window manager(WM.h simply has declarations and includes SAE_GL.h, SAE_SDL.h, and SAE_Core.h)</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"SAE_WM.h\"\n\nnamespace SAE{\n\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_QUIT_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_MENU_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_VERBOSE_FLAG = false;\n\n///Constructor\nSDL_Application::SDL_Application(){\n\n    ///Video Info\n    screen      = (SDL_Surface*)NULL;\n    videoInfo   = (SDL_VideoInfo*)NULL;\n\n    VIEW_MODE               = SAE_PERSPECTIVE;\n    VIEW_DIM                = SAE_3D;\n\n    defaultScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n    currentScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n\n    numResolutions = 0;\n\n    ///Set up our video flags\n    videoFlags  = SDL_OPENGL;

It contains a number of memory allocation caused by the same <code>operator new</code>.  I don't know why they are all combined into one single heap entry but by looking at the content, I managed to find out the code causing the leak.  Perhaps, it's a CRT feature to combine all similar data into one heap entry?

I have spent a considerable amount of time reading up on UNICODE, UTF-8 (and other encodings), widechars and such and here is what I have come to understand so far:</p>\n\n<p>UNICODE, as the standard, describes the set of characters that are mappable and the order in which they occur.  I refer to this as the \"what\": UNICODE specifies <em>what</em> will be available.</p>\n\n<p>UTF-8 (and other encodings) specify the <em>how</em>: How each character will be represented in a binary format.</p>\n\n<p>Now, on windows, they opted for a UCS-2 encoding originally, but that failed to meet the requirements, so UTF-16 is what they have, which is also multi-char when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>So here is the delemma:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Windows internally only does UTF-16, so if you want to support international characters you are forced to convert to their widechar versions to use the OS calls accordingly.  There doesn't seem to be any support for calling something like CreateFileA() with a multi-byte UTF-8 string and have it come out looking proper.  Is this correct?</li>\n\n<li>In C, there are some multi-byte supporting functions (_mbscat, _mbscpy, etc), however, on windows, the character type is defined as unsigned char* for those functions.  Given the fact that the _mbs series of functions is not a complete set (i.e. there is no _mbstol to convert a multi-byte string to a long, for example) you are forced to use some of the char* versions of the runtime functions, which leads to compiler problems because of the signed/unsigned type difference between those functions.  Does anyone even use those?  Do you just do a big pile of casting to get around the errors?</li>\n\n<li>In C++, std::string has iterators, but these are based on char_type, not on code points.  So if I do a ++ on an std::string::iterator, I get the next char_type, not the next code point.  Similarly, if you call std::string::operator[], you get a reference to a char_type, which has the great potential to not be a complete code point.  So how does one iterate an std::string by code point?

I used it to sign a simple INF file that is a driver for some of our USB devices that use Microsoft's usbser.sys.  Everything seems to work on the Windows 7 64-bit computer where I signed it: if I right-click on the INF file and select \"Install\" then the second warning I see is this good warning that shows the correct Publisher name:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4caH4.png\" alt=\"Publisher is correct\"></p>\n\n<p>However, if I go to a different computer (Windows Vista 64-bit), right click on the INF file, and select \"Install\", then I get this error message instead:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bxu7E.png\" alt=\"Cannot verify publisher\"></p>\n\n<p>This makes me think that my drivers are not properly signed, and the only reason it looks good on my computer is because of some root/intermediate/cross certificate I installed during Go Daddy's installation process.

I am not totally sure how it is different from the <em>Code Signing Certificate</em>, but it is the same price.  I followed the <a href=\"http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/6973/downloading-and-installing-a-driver-signing-certificate\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructions on Go Daddy's website to download and install the certificate</a>, though the instructions do not match reality perfectly.  After I installed the Microsoft Cross Certificate in step 1, I saw a red warning message that said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before you can install your certificate, you must use Windows Update to update your root certificates or manually download and install the root certificate from our repository.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what to do about that.  I did install some GoDaddy root certificates from their repository but it made no noticeable difference.</p>\n\n<p>I installed the latest version (8.0) of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg487428.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows Driver Kit (WDK)</a> and then installed the latest version (8.0) of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8</a>.  This gives me access to the <code>inf2cat</code> and <code>signtool</code> utilities.  Both of the kits were released within the last month, so it's possible there could be some new bugs that we are treading on.</p>\n\n<p>In a new directory, I put three files:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>pololu_usb_to_serial.inf</code>, the INF file I want to sign.  It is long but simple; <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3647208\" rel=\"nofollow\">you can read it here</a>.  This INF file is a standalone driver; no other files are needed in our driver package.  This file is basically the same as the version that our company has successfully distributed (unsigned) for years, but I had to make a few changes for Inf2Cat to accept it.</li>\n<li><code>mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt</code>, which I downloaded from the <a href=\"https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.seam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go Daddy certificate repository</a>.  I believe this is the Cross Certificate that proves that the \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" is trusted by Microsoft, but I am not totally sure if this is the right certificate to use.</li>\n<li><code>sign_it.bat</code>, the batch file I run to do the signing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The batch file just contains:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\inf2cat\" /v /driver:%~dp0 /os:XP_X86,Vista_X86,Vista_X64,7_X86,7_X64,8_X86,8_X64\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\signtool\" sign /v /ac \"mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt\" /n \"Pololu Corporation\" /t http://tsa.starfieldtech.com pololu.cat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first command invokes <code>inf2cat</code> from the Windows Driver Kit.  The <code>/v</code> option makes it verbose.  The <code>/driver:%~dp0</code> option points it to the directory that contains the batch file; a <code>.</code> does not work for some reason and this is nicer than having to hard code the full path.  The <code>/os</code> option specifies all the operating systems I would like to support with this driver package.  This command creates <code>pololu.cat</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The second command invokes <code>signtool</code> from the Windows Software Development Kit to sign the catalog file.  The <code>/v</code> option makes it verbose.  The <code>/ac</code> option specifies which cross certificate use (see #2 above). The <code>/n</code> option specifies the name of the certificate to use (that certificate is installed on my computer according to <code>certmgr.msc</code>).

The solution to this guy's problem was to add a CatalogFile directive to the INF file, but I already have that.  (<code>CatalogFile=pololu.cat</code>).</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #1: Signing executables works</h2>\n\n<p>I used signtool with those same options to sign an executable file (NSIS installer), and it worked correctly on the first try, on both computers.  So I think there is something different about the signing policy for INF driver files and that is what is screwing me up.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #2: Warning on GoDaddy's certificate</h2>\n\n<p>If I double click on <code>mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt</code>, in the General tab it says \"Windows does not have enough information to verify this certificate.\" In the Certification Path tab, under \"Certificate status:\", it says \"The issuer of this certificate could not be found.\". I also see those same warnings if I double click on <code>gd_ms_drv_sign_bundle.p7b</code> (a certificate bundle from GoDaddy) and open up the first certificate. </p>\n\n<p>The issuer of both of those certificates is supposed to be the Microsoft Code Verification Root.  Should I worry about that warning message?</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #3: Deleting GoDaddy's certificates</h2>\n\n<p>Lindsay from GoDaddy's advanced support team got back to me.  She linked to <a href=\"https://www.globalsign.com/support/code-signing/codesign_vista64.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page from globalsign</a> which explains how you have to uninstall the root and intermediate certificates from your CA on the computer where you sign the drivers.  Lindsay says that if you don't do this step, the signing tools will assume that those certificates are present on other computers and hence not include them in the signature.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to check what certificates are \"imported\" into a signature?  What tools can I use to see if Lindsay and GlobalSign are right?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, we have Windows XP computers around but Microsoft will stop supporting that OS soon.  Despite what GlobalSign says, there has <em>got</em> to be a way to make this work on Windows 7.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Lindsay's advice, I followed instructions from Microsoft to <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/cc734054\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update</a>, and then I used the UI of <code>certmgr.msc</code> to delete all GoDaddy certificates from \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" and \"Intermediate Certification Authorities\".  Then I re-signed my inf file.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that did not work!  After signing, I double checked that all the GoDaddy certificates are still deleted.</p>\n\n<p>I have received no feedback from GoDaddy on the output of <code>signtool verify</code>, or any input on which driver signing policy I should check when doing the verification.  I was hoping that they could just look at the verification output and tell me what I was doing wrong, or tell me what correct output would look like.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness, here are the three outputs from <code>signtool verify</code> after I deleted those certificates and re-signed the drivers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\david.POLOLU\\Desktop\\sign_inf&gt;\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\\nbin\\x86\\signtool.exe\" verify /v pololu.cat\n\nVerifying: pololu.cat\nSignature Index: 0 (Primary Signature)\nHash of file (sha1): 5AE4F370471009C8B0ED936C9AE19ED14ABD67D7\n\nSigning Certificate Chain:\n    Issued to: Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority -

I couldn't find an explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I took out the DefaultInstall section of my INF file, so from now on I have to test it by running a little DLL I wrote, that calls <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376990.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">SetupCopyOemInf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still no luck; I keep on getting the unverified publisher warning on the Windows Vista computer.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #5: JLink driver is signed correctly</h2>\n\n<p>I was poking around in C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository to try to find some properly signed driver packages.  The first interesting one I found is JLinkCDC.cat/JLinkCDC.inf.  The version of the Inf file is <code>DriverVer=01/25/2012,6.0.2600.4</code>.  On the Windows Vista machine, if I call SetupCopyOemInf on the inf file (using my DLL) then I get a proper message telling me who the publisher is (Segger GMBH or something like that).  Therefore, it is possible to sign driver packages like mine properly, but somehow GoDaddy or I am doing something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The JLinkCDC.inf driver is very similar to my driver because it is just one file and uses usbser.sys.  The trust chain of their signature goes back to VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certificate Authority - G5.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, this JLinkCDC driver is similar to mine and it works, so I plan on looking carefully at it to see what the differences are.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3647208#file_jlinkcdc_verify.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of signtool verify for JLinkCDC.cat</a> looks very similar to mine except it traces back to Verisign instead of GoDaddy.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #6: Minor changes</h2>\n\n<p>To make my driver more like JLinkCDC.inf, I added <code>DriverPackageType=PlugAndPlay</code> to the INF file and I shortened the file names: the files are now called polser.cat and polser.inf.  Still no luck!</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #7: Some success!</h2>\n\n<p>I think the following things are true; please correct me if I am wrong:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For a driver package (.cat file), the correct option for <code>signtool verify</code> is <code>/pa</code>.  I infer this from <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg487328.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">KMCS_Walkthrough.doc</a>.</li>\n<li>For a driver package, Windows only considers the publisher to be verified if the chain of trust goes back to a certificate in the \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" folder in certmgr.msc.</li>\n<li>For a driver package, you can sign it with a cross certificate (extending the chain of trust from gdroot-g2.crt to the Microsoft Code Verification Root), but Windows seems to ignore that.  This is because the Microsoft Code Verification Root is not a \"Trusted Root Certification Authority\".</li>\n<li>There are certificate stores for the current user and certificates for the local machine.  Both of them matter, so you should use the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788967.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MMC Certificates Snap-In</a> to view both.  Certmgr.msc only shows the ones for the current user.</li>\n<li>Windows <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931125\" rel=\"nofollow\">should seamlessly add</a> the \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" (gdroot-g2.crt) to the \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" folder when needed, downloading it from Windows Update, but it doesn't.  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749331%28WS.10%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">More info here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I used the Windows Event Viewer on the test machine to see what was up.  It looks like Windows WILL fetch \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" automatically, but only after it displays the undesirable unverified publisher warning dialog.  As soon as the user closes that dialog, the certificate is fetched from Windows Update, so the next attempt at installation should be successful.  Interestingly, it does automatically download the a Starfield certificate (which is the root at the chain of trust for my timestamp) in a timely manner.</p>\n\n<p>I have gotten my signature to work on Windows 7 and Windows Vista computers by double-clicking on gdroot-g2.crt and importing it before I attempt to install the drivers.  I will see if this process can be automated and added to an installer.</p>\n\n<p>I found a driver package from another company (JLinkCDC.cat) that was signed with a VeriSign certificate, rooted in \"VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\".  That certificate is on all the computers I have looked at, so if you go with VeriSign instead of Go Daddy I think you can avoid this problem with Windows Update.</p>\n\n<p>I did notice that the VeriSign certificates use SHA1 while my Go Daddy certificates use SHA256 for the signature algorithm and signature hash algorithm.  Not sure if that matters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #8: Asked Microsoft for help</strong></p>\n\n<p>See the discussion and my conclusion on the MSDN forums: <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wdk/thread/1fede768-7925-4f30-8eef-ce5bd08b0b60\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wdk/thread/1fede768-7925-4f30-8eef-ce5bd08b0b60</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["windows"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":28,"score":-1,"question_id":13076748,"title":"Closing Task in Windows Task Manager","body":"<p>I have 4 Internet Browser opened in my system. \nI want to end 1 of the application from windows task manager, since it got stuck.</p>\n\n<p>However when I select 1 application and click on 'End Task' button, all my 4 Internet Windows are getting closed.

Thanks to @Werner Henze and @Ven Boigt for their feedback</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Turns out this was a bug in Windows due to being beta and it was fixed in newer revisions so I don't have to worry about this anymore. Thanks for the feedback anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I used to do the following to create a window of an 800*600 client area:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dwStyle = WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME | WS_BORDER | WS_DLGFRAME | WS_SYSMENU | WS_MINIMIZEBOX;\nhWindowHandle = CreateWindow(   L\"CGFramework\", wszWndCaption, \n                            pWindowData-&gt;dwStyle, pWindowData-&gt;nPositionX, pWindowData-&gt;nPositionY, \n                            800 + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CXSIZEFRAME )*2, \n                            600 + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CYSIZEFRAME ) *2\n                            + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CYCAPTION ),\n                            0, 0, hInstance, 0\n                        ); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when querying the client rect with GetClientRect, I used to get 800*600, but now I upgraded my Visual Studio 2008 project to VS2012, and now the GetClientRect() function is returning 792*592 instead. </p>\n\n<p>On top of that, the actual size of the window being created is 804*629, for which I see no reason as the resizeable frame (from WS_THICKFRAME) is obviously larger than 2 pixels on each side.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it was an issue of the Aero behaviour of Windows 8, but then I realized this is only happening with my VS2012 builds and not with my VS2008 builds.

Is there something I can change on my VS2012 project configuration to fix this horrible behaviour?</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing \"DPI Awareness\" setting of the project config, but this is not making any difference.

The return value should always\n  be checked to make sure that the\n  rename operation was successful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my case, as part of an upgrade procedure, I need to move (rename) a directory that may contain gigabytes of data (lots of subdirectories and files of varying sizes). The move is always done within the same partition/drive, so there's no real need to physically move all the files on disk.</p>\n\n<p>There <em>shouldn't</em> be any file locks to the contents of the dir to be moved, but still, quite often, renameTo() fails to do its job and returns false. (I'm just guessing but perhaps some file locks expire somewhat arbitrarily on Windows.)</p>\n\n<p>Currently I have a fallback method that uses copying &amp; deleting, but this sucks because it may take <strong>a lot</strong> of time, depeding on the size of the folder. I'm also considering simply documenting the fact that the user can move the folder manually to avoid waiting for hours, potentially. But the Right Way would obviously be something automatic and quick.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, <strong>do you know an alternative, reliable approach to do a quick move/rename with Java on Windows</strong>, either with plain JDK or some external library. Or if you know an <em>easy</em> way to detect and release any file locks for a given folder and <em>all of its contents</em> (possibly thousands of individual files), that would be fine too.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: In this particular case, it seems we got away using just <code>renameTo()</code> by taking a few more things into account; see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1000183/reliable-file-renameto-alternative-on-windows/1006489#1006489\">this answer</a>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","winapi"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":1,"question_id":12915734,"title":"A global keyboard hook with a delay","body":"<p>I'm making a \"driver\" for a barcode scanner.</p>\n\n<p>This particular scanner is basically a USB keyboard that generates keystrokes whenever something is scanned.</p>\n\n<p>I want to find a way to distinguish these keystrokes from those keystrokes a proper keyboard sends.

Unfortunately the problem can't be solved outside the FOR loop as best I can tell.</p>\n\n<p>This works fine for the single IP example, but not for multiple values being iterated. The problem is, as laid out, your example will only ever return a single line after all iterations, and that line will be the value of the last iteration.</p>\n\n<p>This is much closer to the actual code that's running.
