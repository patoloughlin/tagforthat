The subprocess isn't well behaved so the script makes a non-blocking spawn call and watches the process on the side. If some timeout threshold is met it kills of the process, assuming it has gone of the rails.</p>\n\n<p>In some instances, which are non-reproducible, the spawned subprocess will just disappear and the watcher routine won't pick up on this fact. It'll keep watching until the timeout threshold is passed, try to kill the subprocess and get an error, and then exit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What might be causing the fact that the subprocess has gone away to be undetectable to the watcher process? Why isn't the return code trapped and returned by the call to <code>Popen.poll()</code>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The code I use to spawn and watch the process follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef nonblocking_subprocess_call(cmdline):\n    print 'Calling: %s' % (' '.join(temp_cmdline))\n    p = subprocess.Popen(cmdline, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n    return p\n\n\ndef monitor_subprocess(handle, timeout=1200):\n    start_time = time.time()\n    return_code = 0\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(60)\n        return_code = handle.poll()\n        if return_code == None:\n            # The process is still running.\n            if time.time() - start_time &gt; timeout:\n                print 'Timeout (%d seconds) exceeded -- killing process %i' % (timeout, handle.pid)\n                return_code = handle.terminate()\n                # give the kill command a few seconds to work\n                time.sleep(5)\n                if not return_code:\n                    print 'Error: Failed to kill subprocess %i -- return code was: %s' % (handle.pid, str(return_code))\n                # Raise an error to indicate that the process was hung up\n                # and we had to kill it.\n                raise RuntimeError\n        else:\n            print 'Process exited with return code: %i' % (return_code))\n            break\n    return return_code\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I'm seeing is that, in cases where the process has disappeared, the call to <code>return_code = handle.poll()</code> on line 15 is returning <code>None</code> instead of a return code. I know the process has gone away completely -- I can see that it is no longer there in Task Manager. And I know the process disappeared long before the timeout value was reached.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","shell","scripting","console","cdialog"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":747,"score":1,"question_id":553352,"title":"Command-line dialog tool for Windows","body":"<p>I need a dialog tool similar to cdialog (or whiptail), but one that will work on Windows. </p>\n\n<p>I have MinGW and compiling something from source is no problem, but both cdialog and whiptail, the only ones that I know of, contain code that is UNIX-specific, and so they will not compile on Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any alternatives that I can use?

I'm using the software package ImageMagick. I want to use this package to convert pdfs to pngs on-the-fly from a Unity 3d project -- so that the application can display the PDFs as .png textures in-game when it needs, but still preserves them as PDFs for smaller file sizes. I'm not quite sure what I've done wrong, here -- but when I run it in Unity, all I get is an open cmd prompt without my command in it. Is there something obvious that I'm missing, here? Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Reflection;\nusing System.Security.Policy;\n\npublic class CommandLineTest : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    // Use this for initialization\n    void Start () {\n        string convertedDirName = \"ConvertedPDFs\";\n        string currDir = System.Environment.CurrentDirectory;\n        System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(currDir + @\"\\\" + convertedDirName);\n\n        string strCmdText;\n    strCmdText= @\"/c \" + currDir + @\"\\ImageMagick\\convert.exe \" + currDir + @\"\\PDFs\\Appointment.pdf \" + currDir + @\"\\\" + convertedDirName + @\"\\\" + \"Appointment.png\";\n        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(\"CMD.exe\",strCmdText);\n        //ImageMagick\n        print(strCmdText);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the print statement at the end runs, it prints the following string: c/ convert /c F:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Desktop\\ImageMagickTest\\ImageMagick\\convert.exe F:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Desktop\\ImageMagickTest\\PDFs\\Appointment.pdf F:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Desktop\\ImageMagickTest\\ConvertedPDFs\\Appointment.png</p>\n\n<p>Does anything appear obviously wrong, to you? I should mention that ImageMagick's convert application is not actually \"installed\" on my system -- I'm just using the \"portable\" version and have thrown it in my project folder.

If I can't, then how do I pass an image to the \"convert\" program in imagemagick using, provided I know that it's going to be in my project's folder?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Some people have suggested that I access convert.exe instead of cmd.exe, and to attempt to just feed the image paths to it that way.

The hardware device is responsible sending out precise periodic messages onto various networks that it, in turn, connects too.  Inside the hardware device I have a couple Microchip dsPICs.  There are two modes of operation.  </p>\n\n<p>One scenario is where send simple \"jobs\" down to the dsPICs that, in turn, can send out the precise messages with .001ms accuracy.  This architecture is not ideal for more complex messaging where we need to send a periodic packet that changes based on events going on within the PC application.  So we have a second mode of operation where our PC application will send the periodic messages and the dsPICs simply convert and transmit in response.  All this, by the way, is transparent to the end user of our software.  Our hardware device is a test tool used in the automotive field.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we use a USB to serial chip from FTDI and the FTDI Windows drivers to interface the hardware to our PC software.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that in mode two where we send messages from the PC, the best we are able to achieve is around 1ms on average hardware range.  We are subjected to Windows kernel pre-emption.  I've tried a number of \"tricks\" to improve things such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Making sure our reader &amp; writer threads live on seperate CPU affinities when possible.</li>\n<li>Increasing the thread priority of the writer while reducing that of the reader.</li>\n<li>Informing the user to turn off screen saver and other applications when using our software.</li>\n<li>Replacing createthread calls with CreateTimerQueueTimer calls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All our software is written in C/C++.  I'm very familiar and comfortable with advanced Windows programming; such as IO Completions, Overlapped I/O, lockless thread queues (really a design strategy), sockets, threads, semaphores, etc...</p>\n\n<p>However, I know nothing about Windows driver development.  I've read through a few papers on KMDF vs. UDMF vs. WDM.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping a seasoned Windows kernel mode driver developer will respond here... </p>\n\n<p>The next rev. of our hardware has the option to replace the FTDI chip and use either the dsPIC's USB interface or, possibly, port the open source Linux FTDI stuff to Windows and continue to use the FTDI chip within our custom driver.  I think by going to a kernel mode driver on the PC side, I can establish a kernel driver that can send out periodic messages at more precise intervals without preemption and/or possibly taking advantage of DMA.</p>\n\n<p>We have a competitor in our business who I think does exactly something similar with their tools.  As far as I know, user space applications can not schedule a thread any better than 1ms.  We currently use timeGetTime in a thread.  I've experiemented with timer queues (via CreateTimerQueueTimer) with no real improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Is a WDM the correct approach to achieve more precise timing?</p>\n\n<p>Our competitor some how is achieveing very precise timing from Windows driven signals to their hardware and they do load a kernel driver (.sys) and their device runs over USB2.0 as does ours.</p>\n\n<p>If WDM is the way to go, can I get some advise on what kernel functions I should be studying for setting up the timings?\nThanks for reading</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","build-automation","winddk","umdf"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78,"score":1,"question_id":9066333,"title":"Different library paths for different build environments","body":"<p>I'm developing a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463294\" rel=\"nofollow\">UMDF-driver</a>.

But ZeroMQ is indeed a progress.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","git","apache"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":0,"question_id":12759854,"title":"Client denied by server configuration while trying to use git-http-backend.exe","body":"<p>I use apache 2.4</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sat Oct 06 15:25:47.948789 2012] [authz_core:error] [pid 7580:tid 1232] [client 192.168.100.252:10153] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend.exe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my configuration </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \"C:\\git-server\"&gt;\nOptions +ExecCGI\nAllow from all\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n  DocumentRoot  \"C:/git-server\"\n   ServerName ****\n  DirectoryIndex index.php\n\nSetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT c:/git-server\nSetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL\nSetEnv REMOTE_USER=$REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER\nScriptAlias /git/ \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend.exe/$1\"\n\n\n&lt;LocationMatch \"^/.*/git-receive-pack$\"&gt;\nOptions +ExecCGI\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName intranet\nAuthUserFile \"C:/git-server/config/users\"\nRequire valid-user\n&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;\n\n&lt;LocationMatch \"^/.*/git-upload-pack$\"&gt;\nOptions +ExecCGI\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName intranet\nAuthUserFile \"C:/git-server/config/users\"\nRequire valid-user\n&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am trying 2 days to setup git. i didnt expect that it was that difficult.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","qt","opengl","qglwidget","ogre"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":875,"score":1,"question_id":5024328,"title":"Embedding Ogre into a qt application on windows platform","body":"<p>Embedding Ogre into a qt application\n<a href=\"http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/QtOgre&amp;structure=Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link:QtOgre</a></p>\n\n<p>But it is mac and linux  platform，I try to migrate to windows platform, but failed.\nMy app run like this:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NJ0US.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>enter code here\n#ifndef OGREWIDGET_H\n#define OGREWIDGET_H\n#include \"XVQCUGLLIB_Global.h\"\n#include &lt;QGLWidget&gt;\n#include &lt;Ogre/Ogre.h&gt;\n\n\nclass XVQCUGLFXLIB_API OgreWidget : public QGLWidget\n{\n    //Q_OBJECT;\n\npublic:\n    OgreWidget( QWidget *parent=0 );\n    virtual ~OgreWidget();\n\nprotected:\n     virtual void initializeGL();\n    virtual void resizeGL( int, int );\n    virtual void paintGL();\n\n    void init();\n\n    virtual Ogre::RenderSystem* chooseRenderer( Ogre::RenderSystemList* );\n\n    Ogre::Root *mOgreRoot;\n    Ogre::RenderWindow *mOgreWindow;\n    Ogre::Camera *mCamera;\n    Ogre::Viewport *mViewport;\n    Ogre::SceneManager *mSceneMgr;\n};\n#endif // OGREWIDGET_H\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>///////////////////////////////////////</p>\n\n<pre><code>  #include \"XVQCUGLLIB_Internal.h\"\n\n #include \"OgreWidget.h\"\n #define THIS OgreWidget\n\n OgreWidget::OgreWidget(QWidget *parent)\n     : QGLWidget( parent ),\n     mOgreWindow(NULL)\n {\n     init();\n }\n\n OgreWidget::~OgreWidget()\n {\n     mOgreRoot-&gt;shutdown();\n     delete mOgreRoot;\n     destroy();\n }\n\n /**\n  * @brief init the object\n  * @author kito berg-taylor\n  */\n      void THIS::init()\n      {\n   // create the main ogre object\n   mOgreRoot = new Ogre::Root;\n\n   mOgreRoot-&gt;loadPlugin(\"RenderSystem_GL_d\");\n   Ogre::String rName(\"OpenGL Rendering Subsystem\");\n   Ogre::RenderSystemList rList = mOgreRoot-&gt;getAvailableRenderers();\n   Ogre::RenderSystemList::iterator it = rList.begin();\n   Ogre::RenderSystem *rSys = 0;\n   while(it != rList.end())\n   {\n       rSys = * (it++);\n       Ogre::String strx=rSys-&gt;getName();\n       if(strx == rName)\n       {\n           mOgreRoot-&gt;setRenderSystem(rSys);\n           break;\n       }\n   }\n   mOgreRoot-&gt;initialise(false);

A high-level description of the test is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Main thread:\n------------\nenumerate connected device\nspin off Buffer queuing thread\nwait for completion events from all threads to be set\n\nBuffer queuing thread:\n----------------------\nfor 0 to X\n  create new IoObject\n  queue ioObject's buffer into driver\n  add the buffer to athe std::vector\nspin off Io result thread\nfor (;;)\n  while (number of buffers in queue &lt; X)\n    queue a buffer the same way as before\n\nIo result thread:\n-----------------\nfor (;;)\n  if (number of buffers &gt; 0)\n    GetOverlappedResult from ioObject-&gt;overlapped\n    pop the buffer out of the std::vector\n    read data\n    delete ioObject-&gt;dataBuffer\n    delete ioObject\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All of this is written to break at a key press, and logically works as expected.

It appears that the heap corruption is caused by the deletion of IoObject above.\nThe test app works without issue if I comment out the <code>delete IoObject</code> line and introduce a memory leak, which seems to indicate that I am calling <code>delete</code> prematurely on the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> object (since I can delete ioObject->dataBuffer without issue).\nFurthermore, if I add a Sleep call for some amount of time (~200ms) before deleting <code>ioObject</code>, then everything works as it should.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some issue here with the way I'm using overlapped IO?

But in my application, I want to process the images in the desktop buffer for which I need to have the image data buffer pointer. But when I call function m_temp.GetBits() which is suppsoed to return the pointer of the data , I get NULL pointer there.

Also, it renders non-standard fonts on Windows much better. I've have not done a thorough investigation, but I think it has to do with the fact that both IE9 and Firefox use now a different graphics layer which in apparently renders fonts differently. Also, the reason some of the standard fonts such as Arial, Tahoma etc. look in Firefox the same as 10 years ago is that it actually has a list of exceptions for them (look for <code>gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.force_gdi_classic_for_families</code>).</p>\n\n<p>So far so good.

This single thread sits inside <code>poll()</code> most of the time (I've already converted this to <code>select()</code>, on Windows), the network thread only waking up when there's incoming network data.  When a client command arrives, the network thread fires the command off to a worker thread to actually perform work on the back-end, and then goes back to listening for more incoming commands.  Commands are asynchronous -- multiple commands can come in on one socket, one right after the next.  At any one time, there can be dozens of outstanding commands on a single connection, all being worked on in various worker threads.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that when the worker thread wants to send response data, the network thread is probably asleep inside <code>poll()</code> at the time that the worker thread is trying to send its result.  The network thread has to wait for <code>poll()</code> to time out (or another packet to be received) before it will notice that there's new outbound data queued up to be sent.</p>\n\n<p>Under unix, I deal with this by including a pipe amongst the descriptors being watched by <code>poll()</code>, and when a worker thread has outbound data to send, it also writes a byte of data into the pipe to wake up the network thread.  But WinSock only seems to support waiting on sockets, so that approach isn't going to work for me in Windows.  Is there any way for me to salvage this architecture on Windows using WinSock (so I can share most of the code between different platforms), or is there no option but to write a custom network server implementation for use on Windows?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any advice!</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","multithreading"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13206414,"title":"Why slim reader/writer exclusive lock outperformance the shared one?","body":"<p>I have tested the performance of slim reader/writer lock under windows 7 using the codefrom <em>Windows Via C/C++</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The result surprised me that the exclusive lock out performance the shared one.

(How would the call of SuspendThread know when the target thread was actually suspended?)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <em>I lied.</em> I said this was for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>Well, the strange truth is that I don't see this behavior under Windows XP 64 (at least not in the last week and I don't really know what happened before that)... but we have been testing this Windows application under Wine on Ubuntu 10.x.  The <a href=\"http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/ntdll/thread.c#L766\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wine source for the guts of GetThreadContext</a> contains\nan Access Denied return response on line 819 when an attempt to grab the thread state fails for some reason. I'm guessing, but it appears that Wine GetThreadStatus believes that a thread just might not be accessible repeatedly.  Why that would be true after a SuspendThead is beyond me, but there's the code.  Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: <em>I lied again</em>.  I said we only saw the behavior on Wine.  Nope... we have now found a Vista Ultimate system that seems to produce the same error (again, rarely).   So, it appears that Wine and Windows agree on an obscure case. It also appears that the mere enabling of the Sysinternals Process monitor program aggravates the situation and causes the problem to appear on Windows XP 64; I suspect a Heisenbug.  (The Process Monitor\ndoesn't even exist on the Wine-tasting (:-) machine or the XP 64 system I use for development).</p>\n\n<p>What on earth is it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: Sept 15 2010.  I've added careful checking to the error return status, without otherwise disturbing the code, for SuspendThread, ResumeThread, and GetContext.  I haven't seen <em>any</em> hint of this behavior on Windows systems since I did that.  Haven't gotten back to the Wine experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2010: Strange.  It seems that if I compile this under VisualStudio 2005, it fails on Windows Vista and 7, but not earlier OSes.  If I compile under VisualStudio 2010, it doesn't fail anywhere.  One might point a finger at VisualStudio2005, but I'm suspicious of a location-sensitivve problem, and different optimizers in VS 2005 and VS 2010 place the code a slightly different places.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2012: Saga continues.  We see this failure on a number of XP and Windows 7 machines, at a pretty low rate (once every several thousand runs).  Our Suspend activities are applied to threads that mostly execute pure computational code but that sometimes make calls into Windows.    I don't recall seeing this issue when the PC of the thread was in our computational code.   Of course, I can't see the PC of the thread when it hangs because GetContext won't give it to me, so I can't directly confirm that the problem only happens when executing system calls.  But, all our system calls are channeled through one point, and so far the evidence is that point was executed when we get the hang. So the indirect evidence suggests GetContext on a thread only fails if a system call is being executed by that thread.    I haven't had the energy to build a critical experiment to test this hypothesis yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","icons","file-type"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":13210560,"title":"How do I assign an icon to a custom file type?","body":"<p>Is there any way to do so in C or C++ (I know that it can be done in C#, so if you know how to, it'd also help!)?</p>\n\n<p>What I want is a way to, automatically and through my own application, associate a custom file extension with a custom icon.

This support is always disabled by default, but may be\nenabled/disabled via the /V command line switch to CMD.EXE.  See CMD /?\n\nDelayed environment variable expansion is useful for getting around\nthe limitations of the current expansion which happens when a line\nof text is read, not when it is executed.  The following example\ndemonstrates the problem with immediate variable expansion:\n\n    set VAR=before\n    if \"%VAR%\" == \"before\" (\n        set VAR=after\n        if \"%VAR%\" == \"after\" @echo If you see this, it worked\n    )\n\nwould never display the message, since the %VAR% in BOTH IF statements\nis substituted when the first IF statement is read, since it logically\nincludes the body of the IF, which is a compound statement.  So the\nIF inside the compound statement is really comparing \"before\" with\n\"after\" which will never be equal.  Similarly, the following example\nwill not work as expected:\n\n    set LIST=\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST=%LIST% %i\n    echo %LIST%\n\nin that it will NOT build up a list of files in the current directory,\nbut instead will just set the LIST variable to the last file found.\nAgain, this is because the %LIST% is expanded just once when the\nFOR statement is read, and at that time the LIST variable is empty.\nSo the actual FOR loop we are executing is:\n\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST= %i\n\nwhich just keeps setting LIST to the last file found.\n\nDelayed environment variable expansion allows you to use a different\ncharacter (the exclamation mark) to expand environment variables at\nexecution time.  If delayed variable expansion is enabled, the above\nexamples could be written as follows to work as intended:\n\n    set VAR=before\n    if \"%VAR%\" == \"before\" (\n        set VAR=after\n        if \"!VAR!\" == \"after\" @echo If you see this, it worked\n    )\n\n    set LIST=\n    for %i in (*) do set LIST=!LIST! %i\n    echo %LIST%\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I tried using the <code>!</code> sign, still it does not work for me. I use get <code>!</code> printed on the screen or the wrong result again.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","powershell","command-line","windows-8","microsoft-metro"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":957,"score":4,"question_id":10984786,"title":"How to run a Metro-App from PowerShell on Windows 8?","body":"<p>Related to <a href=\"http://superuser.com/q/433477/79358\">another question on Superuser</a>, I'm trying to run a Metro based application from the command-line.

(Windows, C++)</em></p>\n\n<p>Theoretical situation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>On a Windows PC, I have a <strong>3rd party software</strong> that you use to do stuff (like open/edit/save files...it's not really important). This <strong>3rd party software</strong> has an available <strong>C++ SDK</strong> so you can develop plugins for it.</p></li>\n<li><p>I develop a separate <strong>standalone</strong> Windows C++ program (most likely using Qt) with a GUI. This program is made to run on the same Windows computer as the 3rd party software. This program would act as a <strong>remote control</strong> or sender.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using the 3rd party software's SDK, I develop a tiny <strong>plugin</strong> for the <strong>3rd party software</strong>. This program acts as a receiver, so that my Qt GUI can send commands that this plugin would receive and thus <em>remote control the 3rd party software accordingly</em>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for a basic example, I could press a button on my standalone GUI that would communicate with the plugin that would then open a specified file in the 3rd party software. </p>\n\n<p>What I'm essentially looking for is to develop standalone software that would communicate back and forth with a plugin that I would develop for the 3rd party software.</p>\n\n<p>What is the best approach to this? I really have no clue where to start or what to look at. Are there common C++ libraries that make this type of thing easy?</p>\n\n<p>I'm relatively new to C++ and very new to Qt, so please try to elaborate. Please don't just say \"Use Shared Memory\" or something like that cause I'm not gonna know exactly what you are talking about.</p>\n\n<p>The program would NOT be run on a separate computer, so no network stuff is necessary here I don't think.</p>\n\n<p>Some questions I was thinking about:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What if user has multiple copies of 3rd party software open at the same time. How does my standalone software know which one to communicate with?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I already have my standalone software running and open the 3rd party software, does the plugin somehow have to register or find my standalone software to communicate with it?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I already have the 3rd party software running and then open my standalone software does it have to scan for the plugin to see if its running or how does it find it?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've done a search on the topic on SO but didn't see many questions for C++ specifically and most of them didn't have many answers or weren't very clear or didn't specifically refer to software communication with a plugin for a 3rd party program.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","windows","microsoft-metro","store"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":1,"question_id":13203236,"title":"Setting periodic Live tile update","body":"<p>I have been developing a windows store app, where I need something like</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Periodically call a function that performs a http request and returns the response string</li>\n<li>Update the Live tile with the returned string</li>\n<li>These should happen only when the app is suspended/navigated away to start screen or something</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(I have written the function to perform and return http request)</p>\n\n<p>I referred to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh868228.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> link but I do not know where to put those code in my program.

However, this server program that we use is really buggy, and can at some given moment just stop caring about the alarms. These alarms then pile up, and get all sent at once, when the program is finally restarted. This makes these alarms pretty useless, because by the time you restart the program, you already know that something is wrong with the system.</p>\n\n<p>The solution that I'm aiming at is that Windows Task Scheduler could every night kill and then restart the program with the help of a simple batch file. I can't seem to find a way to kill the process though, because the program's process is running as a subprocess, a child process, of the Windows process csrss.exe.</p>\n\n<p>If I open the taskmanager I can see the process and kill it, but the command <code>tasklist</code> only shows the parent process csrss.exe, and I need the PID to kill it with <code>taskkill</code>. Yes, <code>tasklist</code> does have the extra parameter <code>/t</code> that kills the child process as well, but I need a way to ONLY kill the child process, and leave the apparently essential for Windows csrss.exe running.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Does anyone know how to ONLY kill a child process with the help of a batch file?</p>\n\n<p>This could of course be done by coding a specific program for this, and then have the batch file use that program, but I'm hoping for a quick fix.</p>\n\n<p>So far I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TASKLIST /FI \"IMAGENAME eq program.exe\" 2&gt;NUL | FIND /I /N \"program.exe\"&gt;NUL\nIF NOT %ERRORLEVEL%==0 GOTO :restart\nTASKKILL /FI \"IMAGENAME eq program.exe\" /F /T\n\n:restart\nSTART /D \"C:\\path\\\" program.exe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>I just realized that a process' image name isn't indented in the Task Manager because it's a child process of another process, but because it's a 16-bit process (how intuitive). So, it's a 16-bit process and the question now is how do you find a PID to, or otherwise kill a 16-bit process. <code>Tasklist</code>, as I mentioned, isn't showing it and neither is <code>pslist</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","graphics","windows-7","paint"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":0,"question_id":13198102,"title":"How to create transparent image in MS Paint?","body":"<p>I want to know how to draw transparent image in Microsoft Paint in windows 7.</p>\n\n<p>I searched it on google a lot but couldn't find anything for windows 7 paint.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. I want to draw a star for my application.But i want that when i display it on black background then there should be no rectangular image with a white background and a star on it.It must be a proper star . </p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","windows-7"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12,"score":0,"question_id":13198565,"title":"Windows 7 font too large","body":"<p>I installed a theme (<a href=\"http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Lite-Suite-259740013\" rel=\"nofollow\">metro lite</a>) but now i have a problem: my font size is too large.

Text will overlap, paragraphs within the same div will have different widths, buttons will have shortened width, copy will shift to the right on the page...to the point where some of the site is unusable. I finally figured out that the browser seemed to not be understanding the font correctly. If I used websafe fonts like arial and georgia, the issues went away. So I thought that maybe the @font-face fonts that live on my server were corrupt. The Chrome issue also only appeared to happen on later versions of Chrome (20 and up). The weirdest part about this is that it only happens <i>intermittently</i>. Sometimes the page displays fine and sometimes it looks crazy. This has occurred on multiple computers and cache clearing does not seem to affect the error.</p>\n\n<p>I then integrated Typekit from Adobe to serve the fonts instead from their server. Now the display errors are gone, but all Windows browsers ignore the typekit font and display the fallback fonts instead. That's IE, Firefox, and Chrome on Windows, various versions.</p>\n\n<p>The site is part Ruby on Rails, part php (WordPress), and these issues only happen on the Ruby on Rails pages.

I'm writing a kernel-mode Windows driver, that gets notified when a kernel-mode DLL (or other executable module) is loaded. In some situations I have to intercept the DLL entry point routine. That is, override it so that my routine is called first, and then I may pass control to the original entry point.</p>\n\n<p>On 32-bit (x86 to be exact) there was no problem to do that. I get the module base mapping address, which actually begins with the standard PE header (used by Windows executables). There there's an RVA (address relative to the image base) of the DLL entry point. I just override it by the address of my routine minus the module base address. Voila!</p>\n\n<p>Now, the things are more complicated in 64-bit. The problem is that RVAs are still 32-bit integers. Such RVAs cover the address range starting from the image base address and ending with 4GB offset. There's no problem to reference any symbol inside the same executable module (assume it doesn't exceed 4GB size), however this imposes problems for cross-module interception. Naturally my executable module and the one that I'm trying to hook don't have to fall into the same 4GB range, hence there's a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Temporarily I solved this by overriding the original routine prolog code by an unconditional <code>jmp</code> into my code. This takes 12 bytes on 64-bit platform. Then, in order to call the original code from my routine I restore the overridden 12 bytes (means - I save them before overwriting).</p>\n\n<p>So far - no problems. But now the things are changing, and I'll have to support multi-threaded access to the entry point routine (please don't ask why, it's related to multi-session DLL loaded into a so-called \"user space\", separate for each terminal session).</p>\n\n<p>One of the solutions is to use a global lock, but I'd like to avoid this.</p>\n\n<p>I know about the so-called \"trampoline functions\", but I'd like to avoid this as well. Doing this requires a run-time decoding of the function prolog code to properly identify the instruction boundary and possible branching.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I thought about another idea. What if I could find some \"unneeded\" portion of the original DLL, which is at least 12 bytes length (size of <code>mov RAX addr</code> + <code>jmp RAX</code>). Then this portion could be overridden by <code>jmp</code> into my hands. Then the entry point RVA could be set to this portion!</p>\n\n<p>All that is needed for this to work is the appropriate portion that can be overwritten. I suppose there is such a possibility, since the PE header contains a lot of historical fields that are no more used for decades.</p>\n\n<p>Is this idea worth trying, or is this a well-known technique?

When the server starts up, I want it to read in text from a file supplied as a command-line argument. I'm using Eclipse, and this file is in the same directory as the root of the Java project (so I can just give the filename in the command-line argument instead of a full path). I know that RMI's SecurityManager forbids file I/O by default, so I've created a policy file for my server that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>grant codeBase \"file:///C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/bin/-\" {\n    //Giving the server permission to make connections\n    permission java.net.SocketPermission \"127.0.0.1:1024-\", \"connect, resolve\";\n    permission java.net.SocketPermission \"127.0.0.1:1024-\", \"accept, resolve\";\n    //File I/O permissions\n    permission java.io.FilePermission \"C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/-\", \"read,write,delete\";\n    permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"user.dir\", \"read\";\n    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"readFileDescriptor\";\n    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"modifyThread\";\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Note that the name of my Eclipse project is \"authmatch\", and this is running on Windows).

However, the security manager seems to be somehow ignoring the permissions I grant in my policy, because when I run the application I get this error: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Exception in thread \"main\" java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"smalltest.txt\" \"read\")\n    at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkRead(Unknown Source)\n    at java.io.RandomAccessFile.&lt;init&gt;(Unknown Source)\n    at etremel.authmatch.text.TextFileFormatter.&lt;init&gt;(TextFileFormatter.java:39)\n    at etremel.authmatch.source.PatternMatcherSource.main(PatternMatcherSource.java:302)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the file I'm asking it to read (smalltest.txt) is in the \"authmatch\" project directory, and I explicitly gave my application permission to read that directory with the line</p>\n\n<pre><code>permission java.io.FilePermission \"C:/Users/Edward/College/CS197/authmatch/-\", \"read,write,delete\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>why is it still insisting that it doesn't have read permission for the file? I suspect this may be a Windows issue because I have the same project running on a Linux computer and a similar policy file allows it to read from its local project directory just fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>I ran the server with <code>-Djava.security.debug=access,failure</code> and it generated a bunch of debug messages while parsing the policy file.

More puzzling, it doesn't look like it ever reads the FilePermission for the root authmatch directory, just the authmatch/bin directory. Then it concludes that it should deny access to \"smalltest.txt,\" but it never resolves the full directory path of that file. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, the same project and policy work fine on Linux.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4542,"score":0,"question_id":398571,"title":"Need to Run Windows Security Dialog Box from Command Line","body":"<p>You know, what you normally get when typing ctrl-alt-del or ctrl-alt-end.

Whereas if I link dynamically that means  I am telling qt where to find the already compiled qjson.dll file, and I probably need to include it in the build directory. Either way is fine, I just need to get something to run.   </p>\n\n<p>The same json file runs fine on windows XP and on mac, so I don't think that is corrupted. If I build statically the app can't find a json file to read, the app launches. I have tried this with qt 4.7.4 (this version works on XP and Windows) and I have also tried qt 4.8.1 with the same result. Could it be that I compiled qt wrong? I swear I even saw it work once with a json file, and then it would crash every time.</p>\n\n<p>Any help at all is very appreciated. Could someone even please just send me a comppiled qjson dll file that is not corrupted so I can try linking to that?

There are similar questions on stackoverflow, but none match exact (nor do they have good answers).</p>\n\n<p>I want to write a program (if it doesn't already exist and if it is possible) that allows Windows 7+ users to configure an ad-hoc mesh network using a single WiFi adapter and then somehow allows connectivity similar to normal internet connectivity for each node.  Bonus is if devices like phones do not need extra software, but can connect to one or more mesh nodes as if it were a standard access point.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how to do this, but I think:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A single wireless card can be configured to operate in adhoc mode programmatically using the Windows Wireless-ADHOC API</li>\n<li>Ad hoc mode usually excludes infrastucture mode unless the adapter's driver supports it, so connection from a node to the real internet would need a second adapter.</li>\n<li>Our program would have/need exclusive control of the WiFi adapter.</li>\n<li>The mesh aspect is achieved independently of the adhoc connectivity by a routing protocol such as Babel.</li>\n<li>Internet would have to be provided through some new virtual adapter that is created by our program.  (What role does this new adapter play that makes it the adapter that any network aware program should choose to consult for internet access?)</li>\n<li>If a real internet connection is available on a node, this would be shared by that node to other nodes on the mesh through the Babel implementation</li>\n<li>Whether or not internet is available from any node, not sure what services could be hosted within the mesh itself.  How is resource/domain name resolution provided?</li>\n<li>If the current node has internet, any requests to internet resources would go directly through it and any resources within the mesh would go through Babel.  If direct internet is lost by that node, all traffic would go through Babel.  Does this need to be programmed for or does the windows network stack know how to deal with this, assuming our program is written correctly?</li>\n<li>Since this is Windows 7+, IPv6 is a legitimate choice for addressing nodes in the mesh, however, not all internet connectivity is expected to support IPv6.  Some might.  How do we define the internet segment from the mesh segment?</li>\n<li>The mesh can be arbitrarily large and Babel and the other components would be able to handle it with good bandwidth, low memory usage, and optimal path convergence.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's pretty clear that I don't have the background to actually complete this project, but I'd like to understand the outline of a solution.  Can you comment on what is right about the outline, what is missing/wrong?  What concepts are unnecessary or obsolete because of the advent of newer technologies?</p>\n\n<p>How simple could a node be to operate?  How secure can each node be from other nodes attacking them?  Poisoning network traffic &amp; routing?</p>\n\n<p>I've read about projects that attempt similar goals for Linux, but nothing for current for Windows.  Some discussions of vehicular and emergency responders, but this is different.  My interest is, piqued by Hurricane Sandy, in connectivity for popular residential operating systems in situations of widespread urban connectivity outages.  When power and communication systems for many are unavailable, the mesh can help.  </p>\n\n<p>Almost all mesh participants will not have configured their nodes in advance.  Instead, they might look for other's wireless networks when theirs are down and find the SSID \"Free Emergency Mesh WiFi\" and connect.  As with hotspots, they would be presented with a proxied login page that explains the project and offers an install link if they want to participate.  If not, they can still connect to the mesh \"access point\" as a client.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","qt","qextserialport"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12959612,"title":"QextSerialPort::read() does not return until timeout expired but data is available","body":"<p>I am using QextSerialPort with Qt 4.8.1 on Win32.

Today while changing the way my player character class works, I've come up against a very puzzling problem. The following code forms part of my logic allowing the player to fire bullets. The control variables, b_canFire and b_shouldFire (I plan to rename these to make more sense), are set elsewhere in the class to allow this function to execute when the user presses a key. </p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if(b_canFire &amp;&amp; b_shouldFire)\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Does not work\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Does not work\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I step through this code using my debugger, it becomes aparrent that the values of b_canFire and b_shouldFire are not being changed to false by the assignments inside the if statement. However, if I change the code to the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if((b_canFire) &amp;&amp; (b_shouldFire))\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Works\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Works\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if(b_canFire == true &amp;&amp; b_shouldFire == true)\n    {\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y); // This fires a bullet\n        b_canFire = false; // Works\n        b_shouldFire = false; // Works\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suddenly the assignments work. I have also tried replicating this situation in an empty test-project, as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool bC = true;\nbool bD = true;\n\nif(bC == true &amp;&amp; bD == true)\n{\n    bC = false; // Works\n    bD = false; // Works\n}\n\n\nbool bE = true;\nbool bF = true;\n\nif(bE &amp;&amp; bF)\n{\n    bE = false; // Works\n    bF = false; // Works\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, both of these examples assign the values exactly as they should. Clearly I am missing something here, but for the life of me, I can't see what it is. I have figured out how to fix the problem to make my code work, but it's really bothering me not knowing what is breaking the assignments in the first example, because everything I've learned about C++ so far is telling me they should work fine. </p>\n\n<p>This is my first major project using the C++ language, and I am still learning, so any help or advice from more experienced programmers would be great.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>As requested here is the entire class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;list&gt;\n#include \"SDL_mixer.h\"\n#include \"hiGlobalVars.h\"\n#include \"hiGlobalObjects.h\"\n#include \"hiAssetManager.h\"\n#include \"hiRendering.h\"\n#include \"hiTimer.h\"\n#include \"hiBullet.h\"\n#include \"hiPlayerChar.h\"\n#include \"hiDebugger.h\"\n\n\nusing std::list;\n\n\nPlayerChar::PlayerChar()\n{\n    moveSpeed = 6;\n    moveDir = NONE;\n    b_canFire = true;\n    b_shouldFire = false;\n    box.x = 0;\n    box.y = 470;\n    box.w = 38;\n    box.h = 40;\n}\n\n\nPlayerChar::~PlayerChar()\n{\n\n}\n\n\nvoid PlayerChar::SetPos(int x)\n{\n    box.x = x;\n}\n\n\nvoid PlayerChar::Draw()\n{\n    BlitSurface(box.x, box.y, assets.ss_playerchar_idle, ss_screen);\n}\n\n\nbool PlayerChar::DoFiring()\n{\n    if((b_canFire) &amp;&amp; (b_shouldFire)) \n    {\n        // Fire a bullet\n        Fire(box.x + 22, box.y);\n        b_canFire = false;\n        b_shouldFire = false;\n\n        return true; // fired a bullet\n    }\n    return false; // did not fire a bullet\n}\n\n\nvoid PlayerChar::Fire(int x, int y)\n{\n    // Create a new bullet at the correct location and add it to the global bullet list\n    Bullet* bullet = new Bullet();\n    bullet-&gt;SetPos(x, y);\n    bullets.push_back(bullet);\n\n    // Play bullet firing sound\n    Mix_PlayChannel(-1, assets.mc_firebullet, 0);\n}\n\n\nvoid PlayerChar::HandleInput(Uint8* keystates)\n{\n    if(keystates[SDLK_LEFT] &amp;&amp; keystates[SDLK_RIGHT])// Both direction keys\n        moveDir = NONE;\n    if(keystates[SDLK_LEFT] &amp;&amp; !keystates[SDLK_RIGHT]) // Left key and not right key\n        moveDir = LEFT; \n    if(!keystates[SDLK_LEFT] &amp;&amp; keystates[SDLK_RIGHT]) // Right key and not left key\n        moveDir = RIGHT; \n    if(!keystates[SDLK_LEFT] &amp;&amp; !keystates[SDLK_RIGHT]) // Neither direction key\n        moveDir = NONE;\n\n    if(keystates[SDLK_SPACE]) // Space bar\n        b_shouldFire = true;\n\n    if(!keystates[SDLK_SPACE]) // Allow another bullet to be fired after release\n        b_canFire = true;\n}\n\n\nvoid PlayerChar::Move()\n{\n    if(moveDir == LEFT &amp;&amp; box.x &gt; 0) // If not off screen, move\n        box.x -= moveSpeed;\n    if(moveDir == RIGHT &amp;&amp; box.x &lt; (ss_screen-&gt;w - box.w)) \n        box.x += moveSpeed;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef __hiPlayerChar__\n#define __hiPlayerChar__\n\n\n#include \"SDL.h\"\n#include \"SDL_mixer.h\"\n#include \"hiGlobalVars.h\"\n\n\nenum MoveDir\n{\n    LEFT,\n    RIGHT,\n    NONE\n};\n\n\nclass PlayerChar\n{\nprivate:\n    Sint16 moveSpeed;\n    MoveDir moveDir;\n    bool b_canFire;\n    bool b_shouldFire;\n\npublic:\n    // Ctr &amp; Dtr\n    PlayerChar();\n    ~PlayerChar();\n\n    // Functions\n    void SetPos(int x);\n    bool DoFiring();\n    void Fire(int x, int y);\n    void Move();\n    void Draw();\n    void HandleInput(Uint8* keystates);\n\n    // Size and position\n    SDL_Rect box;\n};\n\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["windows","audio","windows-7","audio-recording","wasapi"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13107368,"title":"Is it possible to caputre the rendering audio session from another process?","body":"<p>I am taking my first dives in to the WSASAPI system of windows and I do not know if what I want is even possible with the windows API.</p>\n\n<p>I am attempting to write program that will record the sound from various programs and break each in to a separate recorded track/audio file.

This project is a 3D-engine(using SDL and openGL for input handling, and graphics respectively). I have been working on this project in linux(Ubuntu 10.10) for the past several months and recently decided to port the code over to a Windows 7 environment. One of the main reasons I chose SDL was because it handles window creation independent of operating system, meaning it should be rather simple to port from one OS to another. I am not having problems compiling or linking, it's the problem that the exact same code is running in two completely different ways for apparently no reason. </p>\n\n<p>First off, a visual example of the differences:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's not supposed to look this way, first off the purple revtanglers in the lower left are supposed to be text, and if you look REALLLY closely you can see some points being rendered, I'm using geometry, vertex, and pixel shaders:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It should look a lot more like this, as it does in linux.

I added some code to check the FPS in windows(sending current fps to log file when a button is pressed) and it was running at 20-30 FPS with shaders disabled.</p>\n\n<p>I'm VERY confused by this because none of the code I'm using is actually DIFFERENT, the only differences are in how I use openGL: in windows I use GLEW to handle my extensions while in linux I use #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES.\nI've looked around and it would seem as though the code I'm using SHOULD work on both linux and windows, although I'm having these very strange effects whenever I run my program in windows.</p>\n\n<p>The problems would be: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>View seems to be stuck in an orthographic projection(when it's set up to be perspective)</li>\n<li>Shaders, Blending, Framebuffers/VBO's, Textures, are not working.</li>\n<li>Extreme delay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only places I think I could be doing something wrong would be in Initializing SDL/OpenGL/GLEW .</p>\n\n<p>I'm directly using GLEW, as the libraries I was originally linking to were giving me problems.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//SAE_GL.h\n/**Header Guard**/\n#ifndef __SAE_OPENGL__\n#define __SAE_OPENGL__\n\n/**Include**/\n///gl extensions\n#ifdef __WIN32\n    #define GLEW_STATIC\n    #include \"GL/glew.h\"\n#else\n    #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES\n#endif\n\n///opengl\n#include \"GL/gl.h\"\n#include \"GL/glu.h\"\n\n///SAE Dependencies\n#include \"SAE_Core.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window manager(WM.h simply has declarations and includes SAE_GL.h, SAE_SDL.h, and SAE_Core.h)</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"SAE_WM.h\"\n\nnamespace SAE{\n\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_QUIT_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_MENU_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_VERBOSE_FLAG = false;\n\n///Constructor\nSDL_Application::SDL_Application(){\n\n    ///Video Info\n    screen      = (SDL_Surface*)NULL;\n    videoInfo   = (SDL_VideoInfo*)NULL;\n\n    VIEW_MODE               = SAE_PERSPECTIVE;\n    VIEW_DIM                = SAE_3D;\n\n    defaultScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n    currentScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n\n    numResolutions = 0;\n\n    ///Set up our video flags\n    videoFlags  = SDL_OPENGL;

It contains a number of memory allocation caused by the same <code>operator new</code>.  I don't know why they are all combined into one single heap entry but by looking at the content, I managed to find out the code causing the leak.  Perhaps, it's a CRT feature to combine all similar data into one heap entry?

I have spent a considerable amount of time reading up on UNICODE, UTF-8 (and other encodings), widechars and such and here is what I have come to understand so far:</p>\n\n<p>UNICODE, as the standard, describes the set of characters that are mappable and the order in which they occur.  I refer to this as the \"what\": UNICODE specifies <em>what</em> will be available.</p>\n\n<p>UTF-8 (and other encodings) specify the <em>how</em>: How each character will be represented in a binary format.</p>\n\n<p>Now, on windows, they opted for a UCS-2 encoding originally, but that failed to meet the requirements, so UTF-16 is what they have, which is also multi-char when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>So here is the delemma:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Windows internally only does UTF-16, so if you want to support international characters you are forced to convert to their widechar versions to use the OS calls accordingly.  There doesn't seem to be any support for calling something like CreateFileA() with a multi-byte UTF-8 string and have it come out looking proper.  Is this correct?</li>\n\n<li>In C, there are some multi-byte supporting functions (_mbscat, _mbscpy, etc), however, on windows, the character type is defined as unsigned char* for those functions.  Given the fact that the _mbs series of functions is not a complete set (i.e. there is no _mbstol to convert a multi-byte string to a long, for example) you are forced to use some of the char* versions of the runtime functions, which leads to compiler problems because of the signed/unsigned type difference between those functions.  Does anyone even use those?  Do you just do a big pile of casting to get around the errors?</li>\n\n<li>In C++, std::string has iterators, but these are based on char_type, not on code points.  So if I do a ++ on an std::string::iterator, I get the next char_type, not the next code point.  Similarly, if you call std::string::operator[], you get a reference to a char_type, which has the great potential to not be a complete code point.  So how does one iterate an std::string by code point?

I used it to sign a simple INF file that is a driver for some of our USB devices that use Microsoft's usbser.sys.  Everything seems to work on the Windows 7 64-bit computer where I signed it: if I right-click on the INF file and select \"Install\" then the second warning I see is this good warning that shows the correct Publisher name:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4caH4.png\" alt=\"Publisher is correct\"></p>\n\n<p>However, if I go to a different computer (Windows Vista 64-bit), right click on the INF file, and select \"Install\", then I get this error message instead:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bxu7E.png\" alt=\"Cannot verify publisher\"></p>\n\n<p>This makes me think that my drivers are not properly signed, and the only reason it looks good on my computer is because of some root/intermediate/cross certificate I installed during Go Daddy's installation process.

I am not totally sure how it is different from the <em>Code Signing Certificate</em>, but it is the same price.  I followed the <a href=\"http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/6973/downloading-and-installing-a-driver-signing-certificate\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructions on Go Daddy's website to download and install the certificate</a>, though the instructions do not match reality perfectly.  After I installed the Microsoft Cross Certificate in step 1, I saw a red warning message that said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before you can install your certificate, you must use Windows Update to update your root certificates or manually download and install the root certificate from our repository.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what to do about that.  I did install some GoDaddy root certificates from their repository but it made no noticeable difference.</p>\n\n<p>I installed the latest version (8.0) of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg487428.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows Driver Kit (WDK)</a> and then installed the latest version (8.0) of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8</a>.  This gives me access to the <code>inf2cat</code> and <code>signtool</code> utilities.  Both of the kits were released within the last month, so it's possible there could be some new bugs that we are treading on.</p>\n\n<p>In a new directory, I put three files:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>pololu_usb_to_serial.inf</code>, the INF file I want to sign.  It is long but simple; <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3647208\" rel=\"nofollow\">you can read it here</a>.  This INF file is a standalone driver; no other files are needed in our driver package.  This file is basically the same as the version that our company has successfully distributed (unsigned) for years, but I had to make a few changes for Inf2Cat to accept it.</li>\n<li><code>mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt</code>, which I downloaded from the <a href=\"https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.seam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go Daddy certificate repository</a>.  I believe this is the Cross Certificate that proves that the \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" is trusted by Microsoft, but I am not totally sure if this is the right certificate to use.</li>\n<li><code>sign_it.bat</code>, the batch file I run to do the signing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The batch file just contains:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\inf2cat\" /v /driver:%~dp0 /os:XP_X86,Vista_X86,Vista_X64,7_X86,7_X64,8_X86,8_X64\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\signtool\" sign /v /ac \"mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt\" /n \"Pololu Corporation\" /t http://tsa.starfieldtech.com pololu.cat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first command invokes <code>inf2cat</code> from the Windows Driver Kit.  The <code>/v</code> option makes it verbose.  The <code>/driver:%~dp0</code> option points it to the directory that contains the batch file; a <code>.</code> does not work for some reason and this is nicer than having to hard code the full path.  The <code>/os</code> option specifies all the operating systems I would like to support with this driver package.  This command creates <code>pololu.cat</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The second command invokes <code>signtool</code> from the Windows Software Development Kit to sign the catalog file.  The <code>/v</code> option makes it verbose.  The <code>/ac</code> option specifies which cross certificate use (see #2 above). The <code>/n</code> option specifies the name of the certificate to use (that certificate is installed on my computer according to <code>certmgr.msc</code>).

The solution to this guy's problem was to add a CatalogFile directive to the INF file, but I already have that.  (<code>CatalogFile=pololu.cat</code>).</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #1: Signing executables works</h2>\n\n<p>I used signtool with those same options to sign an executable file (NSIS installer), and it worked correctly on the first try, on both computers.  So I think there is something different about the signing policy for INF driver files and that is what is screwing me up.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #2: Warning on GoDaddy's certificate</h2>\n\n<p>If I double click on <code>mscvr-cross-gdroot-g2.crt</code>, in the General tab it says \"Windows does not have enough information to verify this certificate.\" In the Certification Path tab, under \"Certificate status:\", it says \"The issuer of this certificate could not be found.\". I also see those same warnings if I double click on <code>gd_ms_drv_sign_bundle.p7b</code> (a certificate bundle from GoDaddy) and open up the first certificate. </p>\n\n<p>The issuer of both of those certificates is supposed to be the Microsoft Code Verification Root.  Should I worry about that warning message?</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #3: Deleting GoDaddy's certificates</h2>\n\n<p>Lindsay from GoDaddy's advanced support team got back to me.  She linked to <a href=\"https://www.globalsign.com/support/code-signing/codesign_vista64.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page from globalsign</a> which explains how you have to uninstall the root and intermediate certificates from your CA on the computer where you sign the drivers.  Lindsay says that if you don't do this step, the signing tools will assume that those certificates are present on other computers and hence not include them in the signature.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to check what certificates are \"imported\" into a signature?  What tools can I use to see if Lindsay and GlobalSign are right?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, we have Windows XP computers around but Microsoft will stop supporting that OS soon.  Despite what GlobalSign says, there has <em>got</em> to be a way to make this work on Windows 7.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Lindsay's advice, I followed instructions from Microsoft to <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/cc734054\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update</a>, and then I used the UI of <code>certmgr.msc</code> to delete all GoDaddy certificates from \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" and \"Intermediate Certification Authorities\".  Then I re-signed my inf file.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that did not work!  After signing, I double checked that all the GoDaddy certificates are still deleted.</p>\n\n<p>I have received no feedback from GoDaddy on the output of <code>signtool verify</code>, or any input on which driver signing policy I should check when doing the verification.  I was hoping that they could just look at the verification output and tell me what I was doing wrong, or tell me what correct output would look like.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness, here are the three outputs from <code>signtool verify</code> after I deleted those certificates and re-signed the drivers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\david.POLOLU\\Desktop\\sign_inf&gt;\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\\nbin\\x86\\signtool.exe\" verify /v pololu.cat\n\nVerifying: pololu.cat\nSignature Index: 0 (Primary Signature)\nHash of file (sha1): 5AE4F370471009C8B0ED936C9AE19ED14ABD67D7\n\nSigning Certificate Chain:\n    Issued to: Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority -

I couldn't find an explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I took out the DefaultInstall section of my INF file, so from now on I have to test it by running a little DLL I wrote, that calls <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376990.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">SetupCopyOemInf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still no luck; I keep on getting the unverified publisher warning on the Windows Vista computer.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #5: JLink driver is signed correctly</h2>\n\n<p>I was poking around in C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository to try to find some properly signed driver packages.  The first interesting one I found is JLinkCDC.cat/JLinkCDC.inf.  The version of the Inf file is <code>DriverVer=01/25/2012,6.0.2600.4</code>.  On the Windows Vista machine, if I call SetupCopyOemInf on the inf file (using my DLL) then I get a proper message telling me who the publisher is (Segger GMBH or something like that).  Therefore, it is possible to sign driver packages like mine properly, but somehow GoDaddy or I am doing something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The JLinkCDC.inf driver is very similar to my driver because it is just one file and uses usbser.sys.  The trust chain of their signature goes back to VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certificate Authority - G5.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, this JLinkCDC driver is similar to mine and it works, so I plan on looking carefully at it to see what the differences are.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3647208#file_jlinkcdc_verify.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of signtool verify for JLinkCDC.cat</a> looks very similar to mine except it traces back to Verisign instead of GoDaddy.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #6: Minor changes</h2>\n\n<p>To make my driver more like JLinkCDC.inf, I added <code>DriverPackageType=PlugAndPlay</code> to the INF file and I shortened the file names: the files are now called polser.cat and polser.inf.  Still no luck!</p>\n\n<h2>Edit #7: Some success!</h2>\n\n<p>I think the following things are true; please correct me if I am wrong:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For a driver package (.cat file), the correct option for <code>signtool verify</code> is <code>/pa</code>.  I infer this from <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg487328.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">KMCS_Walkthrough.doc</a>.</li>\n<li>For a driver package, Windows only considers the publisher to be verified if the chain of trust goes back to a certificate in the \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" folder in certmgr.msc.</li>\n<li>For a driver package, you can sign it with a cross certificate (extending the chain of trust from gdroot-g2.crt to the Microsoft Code Verification Root), but Windows seems to ignore that.  This is because the Microsoft Code Verification Root is not a \"Trusted Root Certification Authority\".</li>\n<li>There are certificate stores for the current user and certificates for the local machine.  Both of them matter, so you should use the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788967.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MMC Certificates Snap-In</a> to view both.  Certmgr.msc only shows the ones for the current user.</li>\n<li>Windows <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931125\" rel=\"nofollow\">should seamlessly add</a> the \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" (gdroot-g2.crt) to the \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" folder when needed, downloading it from Windows Update, but it doesn't.  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749331%28WS.10%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">More info here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I used the Windows Event Viewer on the test machine to see what was up.  It looks like Windows WILL fetch \"Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2\" automatically, but only after it displays the undesirable unverified publisher warning dialog.  As soon as the user closes that dialog, the certificate is fetched from Windows Update, so the next attempt at installation should be successful.  Interestingly, it does automatically download the a Starfield certificate (which is the root at the chain of trust for my timestamp) in a timely manner.</p>\n\n<p>I have gotten my signature to work on Windows 7 and Windows Vista computers by double-clicking on gdroot-g2.crt and importing it before I attempt to install the drivers.  I will see if this process can be automated and added to an installer.</p>\n\n<p>I found a driver package from another company (JLinkCDC.cat) that was signed with a VeriSign certificate, rooted in \"VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\".  That certificate is on all the computers I have looked at, so if you go with VeriSign instead of Go Daddy I think you can avoid this problem with Windows Update.</p>\n\n<p>I did notice that the VeriSign certificates use SHA1 while my Go Daddy certificates use SHA256 for the signature algorithm and signature hash algorithm.  Not sure if that matters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #8: Asked Microsoft for help</strong></p>\n\n<p>See the discussion and my conclusion on the MSDN forums: <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wdk/thread/1fede768-7925-4f30-8eef-ce5bd08b0b60\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wdk/thread/1fede768-7925-4f30-8eef-ce5bd08b0b60</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["windows"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":28,"score":-1,"question_id":13076748,"title":"Closing Task in Windows Task Manager","body":"<p>I have 4 Internet Browser opened in my system. \nI want to end 1 of the application from windows task manager, since it got stuck.</p>\n\n<p>However when I select 1 application and click on 'End Task' button, all my 4 Internet Windows are getting closed.

Thanks to @Werner Henze and @Ven Boigt for their feedback</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Turns out this was a bug in Windows due to being beta and it was fixed in newer revisions so I don't have to worry about this anymore. Thanks for the feedback anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I used to do the following to create a window of an 800*600 client area:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dwStyle = WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME | WS_BORDER | WS_DLGFRAME | WS_SYSMENU | WS_MINIMIZEBOX;\nhWindowHandle = CreateWindow(   L\"CGFramework\", wszWndCaption, \n                            pWindowData-&gt;dwStyle, pWindowData-&gt;nPositionX, pWindowData-&gt;nPositionY, \n                            800 + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CXSIZEFRAME )*2, \n                            600 + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CYSIZEFRAME ) *2\n                            + GetSystemMetrics( SM_CYCAPTION ),\n                            0, 0, hInstance, 0\n                        ); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when querying the client rect with GetClientRect, I used to get 800*600, but now I upgraded my Visual Studio 2008 project to VS2012, and now the GetClientRect() function is returning 792*592 instead. </p>\n\n<p>On top of that, the actual size of the window being created is 804*629, for which I see no reason as the resizeable frame (from WS_THICKFRAME) is obviously larger than 2 pixels on each side.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it was an issue of the Aero behaviour of Windows 8, but then I realized this is only happening with my VS2012 builds and not with my VS2008 builds.

Is there something I can change on my VS2012 project configuration to fix this horrible behaviour?</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing \"DPI Awareness\" setting of the project config, but this is not making any difference.

I've included the library and tested if it's actually loaded through various tests, including a tiny class called installationchecker I downloaded somewhere (sorry I don't remember where). All tests pass fine, including some that I added within my code that are simply <code>if() else</code>clauses to see if the variable where I call the validators are returning true. I developed in windows 7 on wamp, but then on the remote server the code doesn't work. \nI have a Linux testing environment where I copied the backup of my whole site. In there, I had to do <code>chown</code> to the public_html folder to be able to see it in Apache. I also had to do <code>chown</code> on the images folder. I didn't make any further changes and although I noticed that once I downloaded the backup of my site from the remote server, the owner and the group of my public_html folder was 'root', and 'root', that didn't happened with the library, which appears as owned by myself. (I have the library on a separate, sister folder to the public folder). \nAnyway, I have come to the conclusion that the problem is with the code working under Linux, but I have no idea how to investigate if I have the correct permissions on the remote server, or why are the Zend Validators not working under Linux. They work fine on my Windows 7 machine. </p>\n\n<p>The tests I did to see if the Zend Validators load are like this: \nFor the Library itself, I do an include of the following code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php $libreria = '/var/home/u230474/public_classes/Zend/ZendFramework/library';\nset_include_path(get_include_path().PATH_SEPARATOR.$libreria);\nrequire_once('Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php');\n$libload = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();\nif (!$libload) echo \"No se pudo cargar la librería Zend Framework\"; else echo \"Librería cargada\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then for each validator I do: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$validaUno = new Zend_Validate_Regex('etc, etc'); \nif (!$validaUno) echo \"No se cargó la clase de validación\"; else echo \"Clase de validación cargada\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And similary for each validator. Now, it is with the next line that there seems to be a problem, since when I do: </p>\n\n<p><code>if(!$validaUno-&gt;isValid($text))</code> etc. etc. (Here the script seems doesn't work, as none of my validations pass). As I said, this is only in Linux. </p>\n\n<p>I would greatly appreciate some help.

As I said in the topic, I can't even find any mention of what 17 means in the documentation.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","printing","xps"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":13058565,"title":"Creating XPS file with the Microsoft XPS Document Writer programatically","body":"<p>I'm investigating a batch printing solution.  </p>\n\n<p>The files to be printed will be in various (typical) formats, e.g., PDF, Word, Excel, etc.  From what I've gathered (and tested) printing XPS files is the way to go on a Windows platform.  </p>\n\n<p>However, it's completely unclear to me how one actually creates an XPS file - without intimate knowledge of the input file format in question (<em>programmatically</em> that is).    </p>\n\n<p>My hope was that I could print to the local <em>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</em> \"printer\" and then physically print its output (i.e., the XPS file).</p>\n\n<p>I'm unable to do this successfully programmatically.

It listens on one port throughout the run of the program, and waits for connections from distant peers.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, this works well. However, due to some problems I'd experienced, I've decided to add a simple debug print directly after the call to <code>WSARecvFrom</code> (the win32 function used in the library to recv datagrams from my socket of interest, and tell what IP and port they came from).<br>\nStrangely enough, in some cases, I've discovered packets are dropped at the <strong>OS level</strong> (i.e. I see them in Wireshark, they have the right dst-port, all checksums are correct - but they never appear in the debug prints I've implanted into the code).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm fully of the fact (people tend to mention a bit too often) that \"UDP doesn't guarantee delivery\" - but this is not relevant, as the packets <strong>are</strong> received by the machine - I see them in Wireshark.<br>\nAlso, I'm familiar with OS buffers and the potential to fill up, but here comes the weird part...</p>\n\n<p>I've done some research trying to find out which packets are dropped exactly. What I've discovered, is that all dropped packets share two things in common (though <em>some</em>, but definitely not <em>most</em>, of the packets that <em>aren't</em> dropped share these as well):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They are small. Many of the packets in the protocol are large, close to MTU - but all packets that are dropped are under 100 bytes (gross).</li>\n<li>They are always one of two: a SYN-equivalent (i.e. the first packet a peer sends to us in order to initiate communications) or a FIN-equivalent (i.e. a packet a peer sends when it is no longer interested in talking to us).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can either one of these two qualities affect the OS buffers, and cause packets to be randomly (or even more interesting - selectively) dropped?<br>\nAny light shed on this strange issue would be very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (24/10/12):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think I may have missed an important detail. It seems that the packets dropped before arrival share something else in common: They (and I'm starting to believe, <em>only</em> they) are sent to the server by \"new\" peers, i.e. peers that it <strong>hasn't tried to contact before</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a syn-equivalent packet arrives from a peer* we've never seen before, it will not be seen by <code>WSARecvFrom</code>. However, if we have sent a syn-equivalent packet to that peer <strong>ourselves</strong> (even if it didn't reply at the time), and now it sends <strong>us</strong> a syn-equivalent, we will see it.</p>\n\n<p>(*) I'm not sure whether this is a <em>peer</em> we haven't seen (i.e. ip:port) or just a <em>port</em> we haven't seen before.</p>\n\n<p>Does this help?<br>\nIs this some kind of WinSock option I've never heard of?

One of problems I have to solve is to identify each unique client in network (not so much of a problem), so that I can apply certain attributes to every specific client, retain and enforce those attributes during deployment lifetime of a specific client.</p>\n\n<p>While I was looking for a solution, I was aware of following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Windows activation system uses some kind of heavy fingerprinting mechanism, that is extremely sensitive to hardware modifications,</li>\n<li>Disk imaging software copies along all Volume IDs (tied to each partition when formatted), and custom, uniquely generated IDs during installation process, during first run, or in any other way, that is strictly software in its nature, and stored in registry or on hard drive, so it's very easy to confuse two </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obvious choice for this kind of problem would be to find out BIOS identifiers (not 100% sure if this is unique through identical motherboard models, though), as that's the only thing I can rely on, that isn't duplicated, transferred by cloning, and that can't be changed (at least not by using some user-space program). Everything else fails as either being not reliable (MAC cloning, anyone?), or too demanding (in terms that it's too sensitive to configuration changes).</p>\n\n<p>Sub-question that I'd like to ask is, am I doing it correctly, architecture-wise? Perhaps there is a better tool for task that I have to accomplish...</p>\n\n<p>Another approach I had in mind is something similar to handshake mechanism, where server maintains internal lookup table of connected client IDs (which can be even completely software-based and non-unique at any given moment), and tells client to come up with different ID during handshake, if duplicate ID is provided upon connection. That approach, unfortunately, doesn't play nicely with one of requirements to tie attributes to specific client during lifetime.</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","microsoft","ms-office","office-2010"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13053109,"title":"How to rearm Microsoft Office in 2010 Information Worker Demonstration and Evaluation Virtual Machine (SP1)","body":"<p>I'm doing some tests in a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27417\" rel=\"nofollow\">2010 Information Worker Demonstration and Evaluation Virtual Machine (SP1)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, after a few days (maybe ~180), <strong>Office is now saying that it needs to be activated.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've tried rearming with OSPPREARM.EXE, but I get the following error: <em>\"The security processor reported that the maximum allowed number of re-arms has been exceeded.

E.g. you're halfway through writing the file and crash/powerfail/BSOD then you definitely have a corrupted file. Doing a temp file write and then a move is a commonly used and simple way of ensuring that you do an atomic file operation as possible (well, as close as is reasonable without using NTFS specific APIs).

These scripts call into native Win32 applications that don't link with Cygwin, which is apparently not officially supported by Cygwin.</p>\n\n<p>This has come as a surprise to me, as for years I was under the impression that Cygwin could be used in a more mixed environment that combines both native non-Cygwin Win32 apps, and POSIX programs using the Cygwin compatibility layer.  But apparently only the POSIX compatibility layer is really supported, and if native Win32 non-Cygwin apps work then it is considered a happy coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>I found this out from an incompatibility I ran into with running programs compiled against the .NET Framework from within Cygwin.  This used to work fine, but was broken a few months ago.  Specifically, standard output from a .NET program that is piped to any other Win32 program's standard input will generally cause the receiving Win32 program to get a premature end-of-file signal because Cygwin recently switched to message pipes from byte pipes a few months ago - and message pipes appear to be incompatible with any receiving app using Visual C++ or .NET Framework.  This is because .NET issues a null write to the standard output, which is only passed on to the receiving app if a message pipe is used.  The receiving app successfully reads zero bytes, so thinks it is end-of-file.  The project lead doesn't appear to consider this to be a real problem, since they apparently don't really support running non-Cygwin programs from within Cygwin (surprise!).</p>\n\n<p>To quote the project lead Christopher Faylor from multiple e-mails on the mailing list:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What you are seeing may be because Cygwin was changed to use\n  message-type pipes a couple of revisions ago.  This is not going to\n  change.  The change was adopted to fix a problem with Cygwin programs\n  and those are obviously our #1 priority.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regardless of how many people use Visual C++ or .NET they are really\n  not our target audience.  It's nice when things work for people who\n  don't want to use UNIX tools but they are not our primary focus. \n  Fixing problems for people who want to use non-Cygwin stuff is not\n  something that I find a high priority.</p>\n  \n  <p>From pipe.cc: Note that the write side of the pipe is opened as PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE. \n  This <em>seems</em> to more closely mimic Linux pipe behavior and is \n  definitely required for pty handling since fhandler_pty_master writes\n  to the pipe in chunks, terminated by newline when CANON mode  is\n  specified.  </p>\n  \n  <p>The above comment shows an \"and\" relationship here.  Message type\n  pipes more closely mimic Linux (UNIX) pipe behavior AND are definitely\n  required for ptys.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>I agree with James that the runtimes are probably buggy BUT I also \n    agree that cygwin should be able to have a handle these scenarios.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Your complete agreement with each other is not going to have much\n  effect.  Cygwin source code is not changed by voting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if this one issue is ultimately fixed somehow - who knows - they might break something else in 3 months and not care to fix the regression.  They might consider a patch, but it would take me quite awhile to figure out something that works.  I think my time is better spent elsewhere, because it's clear that they are quite willing to break compatibility with native Win32 apps and don't want to waste more time on getting Win32 apps to work.  So I guess Cygwin shouldn't be considered a stable platform for mixed Win32/Cygwin environments - what are my alternatives?  Where should I start that would avoid a complete rewrite into something other than bash?  I don't use more than the base Cygwin installation + some basic perl scripts.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","windows","sdk","jdk"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2414,"score":1,"question_id":5413691,"title":"Android SDK deosn't think JDK is installed? - Windows 7","body":"<p>On Windows 7 I have installed the Java SE JDK, then rebooted.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H02Vu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>When I then run the Android SDK installer, there is a warning that the JDK is not installed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kfm9d.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","windows","winapi","richtextbox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":1,"question_id":11141549,"title":"Rich edit control: difference between rcPage and rc members of FORMATRANGE structure","body":"<p>The Win32 <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787605%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">rich edit control</a> has a message called <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb788020%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>EM_FORMATRANGE</code></a> that can render the contents of the control to an arbitrary device context.

This problem has had me stressed out for quite some time now and there doesn't seem to be any clear solution, other than forcing non-windows machines to use the file permissions windows seems to inflict.</p>\n\n<p>Let's begin with the scenario. I have 2 development machines, one running Windows7, the other Mac OSX. They both are using Eclipse and EGit, and both have cloned the same project from a remote repo. That's where the similarities end, because my windows machine has a nasty habit of retaining a file mode of <strong>644</strong> (r-xr--r--) on its local repo, while the mode on the Mac defaults to a cool <strong>775</strong> (rwxrwxr--x).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem's obviously the file permissions - GIT reports there are files that have changed due to differences in file modes and not actual content. The solution seemed obvious, run the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code> git config core.filemode false\n git config --global core.filemode false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which worked like a charm, <em>except</em> when committing and merging resolved <em>conflicts</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say files A, B and C exist on both the Windows and Mac repos. Next, let's change the file mode for these 3 files on the Mac machine so that the developer can edit them. Now change some of the contents in file A. Because we're ignoring the file modes (thanks to the commands above) only file A will be committed and pushed, ready for the Windows machine to fetch, merge and enjoy...</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's edit file A again on the Mac <em>and</em> on the Windows machines, effectively causing a potential conflict, and let the Windows machine commit and push file A first. Then, when the Mac user commits their changes to file A and fetches the latest changes from the remote repo, a conflict is obviously created.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving the conflict on the Mac machine and adding file A back to their local repo, committing that merge includes the previously ignored files B and C, and thus highlighting my problem! Why are the previously ignored files being included in this merge commit? This doesn't seem to be a Mac / Windows problem exclusively, as this problem can be recreated both ways...</p>\n\n<p>This probably wouldn't matter if there were only 3 files, but this project I'm referring to includes thousands, and all these up and down push and pulls are insane. Am I missing something really obvious? Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","windows","safari","web-inspector"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":180,"score":4,"question_id":12556895,"title":"Accessing iOS Safari Web Inspector from Windows Machine","body":"<p>New iOS 6 Safari comes with Web Inspector feature which allows to connect to it from your desktop Safari via USB cable.

Why would a game not run when everything is theoretically backwards-compatible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","date","logging","time","batch"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":1,"question_id":12972241,"title":"Windows batch scripting: Showing date, time and all output in logs","body":"<p>I have made a script that I am going to call using windows scheduler to back up a Ruby on Rails app I have made.</p>\n\n<p>When I call the command normally in a command window, the output looks like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\app&gt;heroku db:pull --confirm app\n    Loaded Taps v0.3.23\n    Auto-detected local database: postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/app?encoding=utf8\n    Warning: Data in the database 'postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/app?encoding=utf8' will be overwritten and\n     will not be recoverable.\n    Receiving schema\n    Schema:          0% |                                          | ETA:  --:--:--\n    Schema:         20% |========                                  | ETA:  00:00:21\n    Schema:         40% |================                          | ETA:  00:00:18\n    Schema:         60% |=========================                 | ETA:  00:00:12\n    Schema:         80% |=================================         | ETA:  00:00:05\n    Schema:        100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:29\n    Receiving indexes\n    schema_migrat:   0% |                                          | ETA:  --:--:--\n    schema_migrat: 100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:05\n    users:           0% |                                          | ETA:  --:--:--\n    users:          50% |=====================                     | ETA:  00:00:05\n    users:         100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:10\n    Receiving data\n    5 tables, 1,000 records\n    table1: 100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00\n    table2:         100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00\n    table3: 100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00\n    table4:      100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00\n    table5:      100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:01\n    Resetting sequences \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my .bat:</p>\n\n<pre><code>heroku db:pull --confirm app &gt;&gt; log.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I run this twice, this is the output that goes into a file, log.txt</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loaded Taps v0.3.23\nAuto-detected local database: postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/webapp_development?encoding=utf8\nWarning: Data in the database 'postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/webapp_development?encoding=utf8' will be overwritten and will not be recoverable.\nReceiving schema\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving indexes\n\n\n\nReceiving data\n5 tables, 1,000 records\nResetting sequences\n\nLoaded Taps v0.3.23\nAuto-detected local database: postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/webapp_development?encoding=utf8\nWarning: Data in the database 'postgres://db:pass@127.0.0.1/webapp_development?encoding=utf8' will be overwritten and will not be recoverable.\nReceiving schema\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving indexes\n\n\n\nReceiving data\n5 tables, 1,000 records\nResetting sequences\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there any way to include the exact console output, and also include dates and times of when the script was run?

I hope it's not inappropriate to do that (just tell me if it is).</p>\n\n<p>I’ve developed a small scientific program that performs some mathematical computations. I’ve tried to optimize it so that it’s as fast as possible. Now I’m almost done deploying it for Windows, Mac and Linux users. But I have not been able to test it on many different computers yet.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what troubles me: To deploy for Windows, I’ve used a laptop which has both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it (dual boot). I compared the speed of the app running on these two systems, and I was shocked to observe that <strong>it’s at least twice as slow on Windows!</strong> I wouldn’t have been surprised if there were a small difference, but how can one account for such a difference?</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few precisions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The computation that I make the program do are just some brutal and stupid mathematical calculations, basically, it computes products and cosines in a loop that is called a billion times. On the other hand, the computation is multi-threaded: I launch something like 6 QThreads.</li>\n<li>The laptop has two cores @1.73Ghz. At first I thought that Windows was probably not using one of the cores, but then I looked at the processor activity, according to the small graphic, both cores are running 100%.</li>\n<li>Then I thought the C++ compiler for Windows didn’t the use the optimization options (things like -O1 -O2) that the C++ compiler for Linux automatically did (in release build), but apparently it does.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I’m bothered that the app is so mush slower (2 to 4 times) on Windows, and it’s really weird. On the other hand I haven’t tried on other computers with Windows yet. Still, do you have any idea why the difference?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional info:</strong> some data…</p>\n\n<p>Even though Windows seems to be using the two cores, I’m thinking this might have something to do with threads management, here’s why:</p>\n\n<p>Sample Computation n°1 (this one launches 2 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 7.33s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 3.72s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 1.36s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample Computation n°2 (this one launches 3 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 6.84s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 3.24s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 1.06s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample Computation n°3 (this one launches 6 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 8.35s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 2.62s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 0.47s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows = my 2 cores laptop (@1.73Ghz) with Windows 7</li>\n<li>PC1-linux = my 2 cores laptop (@1.73Ghz) with Ubuntu 12.04</li>\n<li>PC2-linux = my 8 cores laptop (@2.20Ghz) with Ubuntu 12.04</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Of course, it's not shocking that PC2 is faster. What's incredible to me is the difference between PC1-windows and PC1-linux).</p>\n\n<p>Note: I've also tried running the program on a recent PC (4 or 8 cores @~3Ghz, don't remember exactly) under Mac OS, speed was comparable to PC2-linux (or slightly faster).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I'll answer here a few questions I was asked in the comments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I just installed Qt SDK on Windows, so I guess I have the latest version of everything (including MinGW?). The compiler is MinGW. Qt version is 4.8.1.</p></li>\n<li><p>I use no optimization flags because I noticed that they are automatically used when I build in release mode (with Qt Creator). It seems to me that if I write something like QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -O1, this only has an effect in debug build.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lifetime of threads etc: this is pretty simple. When the user clicks the \"Compute\" button, 2 to 6 threads are launched simultaneously (depending on what he is computing), they are terminated when the computation ends. Nothing too fancy. Every thread just does brutal computations (except one, actually, which makes a (not so) small\"computation every 30ms, basically checking whether the error is small enough).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: latest developments and partial answers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are some new developments that provide answers about all this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I wanted to determine whether the difference in speed really had something to do with threads or not. So I modified the program so that the computation only uses 1 thread, that way we are pretty much comparing the performance on \"pure C++ code\". It turned out that now Windows was only slightly slower than Linux (something like 15%). So I guess that <strong>a small (but not unsignificant) part of the difference is intrinsic to the system, but the largest part is due to threads management</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>As someone (Luca Carlon, thanks for that) suggested in the comments, I tried building the application with the compiler for Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC), instead of MinGW. And suprise, the computation (with all the threads and everything) was now \"only\" 20% to 50% slower than Linux! I think I'm going to go ahead and be content with that. I noticed that weirdly though, the \"pure C++\" computation (with only one thread) was now even slower (than with MinGW), which must account for the overall difference. So as far as I can tell, <strong>MinGW is slightly better than MSVC except that it handles threads like a moron</strong>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, I’m thinking either there’s something I can do to make MinGW (ideally I’d rather use it than MSVC) handle threads better, or it just can’t. I would be amazed, how could it not be well known and documented ? Although I guess I should be careful about drawing conclusions too quickly, I’ve only compared things on one computer (for the moment).</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","windows","console","windows-console","pythonw"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":976,"score":4,"question_id":1765078,"title":"How to avoid console window with .pyw file containing os.system call?","body":"<p>If I save my code files as <code>.pyw</code>, no console window appears - which is what I want - but if the code includes a call to <code>os.system</code>, I still get a pesky console window.

Since, I can't follow pointer movement here to animate, I am using a storyboard animation to get things done. </p>\n\n<p>So, what I essentially have is a Canvas for the whole game board, and a small chess piece image at the bottom corner. Initial setup is simple as I can set the Top and Left property of the chess piece manually. To move the chess piece, I am just calculating the new Top and Left property depending on the move. For example, if player moves pawn upwards, value of Top changes by (Canvas.Height / 8) but Left property stays same. Now, till here, everything is fine. Only problem is, this causes image to jump from initial to final location, instead of an smooth movement. </p>\n\n<p>So, I have created storyboard for animating the top and left position as below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Storyboard x:Key=\"storyboard\"&gt;\n    &lt;DoubleAnimation x:Name=\"playerLeftAnimation\" Storyboard.TargetName=\"playerPiece\"\n                     Storyboard.TargetProperty=\"Canvas.Left\" \n                     EnableDependentAnimation=\"True\"    \n                     Duration=\"0:0:2\" /&gt;\n    &lt;DoubleAnimation x:Name=\"playerTopAnimation\" Storyboard.TargetName=\"playerPiece\"\n                     Storyboard.TargetProperty=\"Canvas.Top\" \n                     EnableDependentAnimation=\"True\"    \n                     Duration=\"0:0:2\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Storyboard&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works well, if I use this method for normal dependency properties like Fontsize.

The resource editor creates for each one the file like MYCURSOR.CUR with the bitmap and the other info, adds one entry to the <code>app.rc</code> file like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IDC_MYCURSOR      CURSOR     \"MYCURSOR.CUR\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and adds one line to the generated <code>resource.h</code> like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define  IDC_MYCURSOR 103\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the application is compiled, the compiled resources take the binary form that becomes integral part of the <code>app.exe</code>. When the wxWidgets framework is not used, one can call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HCURSOR hCur = LoadCursor(hInstance, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDC_MYCURSOR));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>hInstance</code> is the handle to the application that has the executable with the cursor resource (in compiled binary form, here inside the <code>app.exe</code>).</p>\n\n<p>With wxWidgets, I can create the instance of the <code>wxCursor</code> class, and pass it the name of the file with the cursor -- like <code>wxCursor cursor(wxT(\"MYCURSOR.CUR\"));</code> -- and it works.

The code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>switch ( kind )\n{\n    case wxBITMAP_TYPE_CUR_RESOURCE:\n        hcursor = ::LoadCursor(wxGetInstance(), filename.t_str());\n        break;\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>suggests that the <code>LoadCursor()</code> is used the way that is not used for the stack Windows cursor (otherwise the first argument should be NULL). The <code>::LoadCursor</code> names the argument as <code>LPCTSTR lpCursorName</code>, and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648391%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">the doc says</a> that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The name of the cursor resource to be loaded. Alternatively, this parameter can consist of the resource identifier in the low-order word and zero in the high-order word. The MAKEINTRESOURCE macro can also be used to create this value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tried also the </p>\n\n<pre><code>wxCursor cur(MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDC_MYCURSOR), wxBITMAP_TYPE_CUR_RESOURCE);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it fails because the <code>wxCursor</code> constructor applies the string conversion -- see the above <code>filename.t_str()</code>. Can you comment on this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOLVED</strong> (plus some explanation what I was confronted with...)</p>\n\n<p>Earlier, I have worked with Windows application resources only via IDE, or I did only small things directly via an <code>app.rc</code> file. When digging deeper with the help of the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12704183/1346705\">VZ's answer</a> and the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12696948/1346705\">ravenspoint answer</a>, I may understand better what they initially meant and what Microsoft did in the past and later, and what was the source of my confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, when you create some resource (say mouse cursor) via Visual Studio IDE, it is automatically given a <em>numeric identification</em> (say <code>103</code>). The number is automatically captured in <code>resource.h</code> as <code>#define IDC_MYCURSOR 103</code> -- i.e. given also the macro identifier. The macro identifier is used when the information about the cursor is inserted to the <code>app.rc</code>, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IDC_MYCURSOR      CURSOR     \"MYCURSOR.CUR\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As the <code>resource.h</code> is included into the <code>app.rc</code>, it is probably roughly equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>103               CURSOR     \"MYCURSOR.CUR\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the resource compiler probably converts the <code>103</code> number to <code>#103</code> string or something like that. Probably because of that, the <code>wxCursor(\"#103\", wxBITMAP_TYPE_CUR_RESOURCE);</code> works. The indirection of the <code>103</code> via the <code>resource.h</code> was the source of my confusion when trying to understand ravenspoint's point :)</p>\n\n<p>However, the usage of an <code>app.rc</code> without the <code>resource.h</code> and the string identifier of the resource was probably the initial intention of the designers. Thus, writing</p>\n\n<pre><code>mycursor          CURSOR     \"MYCURSOR.CUR\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>means that the resource-script-file compiler creates the <code>\"mycursor\"</code> string identifier that can be used directly inside the <code>LoadCursor()</code> function or the <code>wxCursor(\"mycursor\", ...);</code>. This is the way recommended by VZ and found in the pointed out wx samples.</p>\n\n<p>I have created my own <code>cursor.rc2</code> that contains mouse-cursor resource information. The <code>.rc2</code> is then included into the <code>app.rc</code> file to be combined with the other resource information... and it works! :) The summary is: <em>Do not use numbers for identification of the resources. Use strings.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for your time and experience,\n   Petr</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","directshow","video-capture"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3304,"score":3,"question_id":542693,"title":"Alternatives to DirectShow for video capture on Windows","body":"<p>I am looking at updating a program that currently uses DirectShow for video capture.

The COM port appears in Device Manager when I connect my hardware device to the computer, and disappears when I disconnect it.  I don't know a lot about this but I assume it to be normal behavior.</p>\n\n<p>2) 921600 baud used to work, in the app I sell and in a sample program I wrote that ran fine the last time I used it, but yesterday started failing on the grounds that requesting 921600 baud now causes <code>SetCommState()</code> to fail with \"the parameter is incorrect.\"  Changing the requested baud rate to 115200 allows <code>SetCommState()</code> to succeed, but unacceptably slows communication.</p>\n\n<p>3) 921600 baud STILL WORKS IN REALTERM.  I can set the port to 921600 baud and open it; it \"just works,\" with no errors or other complaints.  I can talk to my instrument and get data, etc., just as always.</p>\n\n<p>4) I did reinstall the driver a week or two ago, as part of solving a problem in which Windows had incorrectly marked a large number of COM ports as \"in use.\" Driver installation claimed to succeed, but the port could not be opened; Device Manager showed a yellow triangle/exclamation/problem.  A lot of trial-and-error eventually revealed that the installation process had failed to copy a .inf file into system32.  I copied that file into place \"by hand\" and normal operation ensued--until today.</p>\n\n<p>5) Device Manager today shows 115200 baud as the highest rate available for the device, but I'm not at all sure it EVER DID show any higher rate; I never worried about it because it \"just worked.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, everything worked fine 'til yesterday, and now suddenly my own apps won't do 921600 baud but RealTerm still will.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions?

gnustep's libobjc library.and in apple's libojbc.dll 's .def file:\"libojbc.def\" , i found another method named \"objc_lookUpClass\".\ngoogle searching again.so,\napple's libojbc are different with gnustep's libobjc.\napple's libojbc using NextStep library interface.gnustep made a different one.</p>\n\n<p><code>man gcc</code></p>\n\n<p>gcc have two options about this.</p>\n\n<p><code>-fgnu-runtime</code> . that's gcc's default options,using gnu style runtime.<br>\n<code>-fnext-runtime</code> , this using nextstep(now it's apple) style running.</p>\n\n<p>so i pass nextstep style option to clang(or gcc?).\n<code>clang -fnext-runtime</code></p>\n\n<p>compile .o to .s with no error.seem like ld.exe finds all method it need from apple's libobjc library
