object, I think that particular thing changed between 1.4.0 and 1.5.0, so, whilst the original call to the launch() method was like:</p>\n\n<p>app.launch();</p>\n\n<p>I found out that that wouldn't work in 2.1.0 and that I could call it like:</p>\n\n<p>app.app.launch();</p>\n\n<p>This works allright in Chrome where calling fireCreateLocalStore() from the code I pasted above ends calling it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I compile this in Eclipse and deploy it with the debug option, I see the logcat going through the creation of the database objects (just before) and when it hits the launch() line I get the error from the title : Uncaught ReferenceError: app is not defined</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing the offending global to something less conflicting, like MyApp in the html and App.js (plus

It could even use a counter, so you can see at any given moment how many times that line has been run.</p>\n\n<p>Basically where it would come in handy is when you get an exception thrown in such a way that your stack trace is less than informative (maybe error handling is handled in a separate thread, or maybe different packages have different optimization settings so not all are directly debuggable), you can then look and easily see which lines of code have executed, and very quickly narrow down the source of the exception.  I'm aware that you can put a hit-count on regular break points, and you can just set the value really high to stop it from actually breaking at these points, but break point counters aren't immediately visible, so you have to hover over them one by one to see where execution stopped.  This would provide an immediate trail leading right to the point where things went wrong - like following the missing dots to figure out where Pacman is.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just curious if anyone's seen a plug-in out there that can do this sort of thing or if I'm just dreaming here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","reverse-engineering","ollydbg"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13076637,"title":"Determining the rate at which a function is called with OllyDbg","body":"<p>How can I find out how many times per second a particular function is called using OllyDbg?

Every once in a while (every few months or so) the application crashes due to an unhandled exception. Obviously, we have a release executable running on prod and that is not about to change. </p>\n\n<p>Examining the latest crash:</p>\n\n<p>Two events (event viewer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>APPLICATION Event (error):</strong> \n  \"Faulting application XXX , faulting module mfc42.dll, version 6.6.8032.0, fault address <strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong>\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>SYSTEM Event: Information (Application Popup)</strong>\n  \"Socket Notification Sink: XXX application error: The instruction at <strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong> referenced memory at 0xd4273c00. The memory could not be read\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, I'm rather inexperienced with remote debugging but I'm trying to make use of this information along with the MAP files available. Any input towards the right direction would help..</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the exception is fired from within the mf42.dll. I can also verify this by using a utility called <em>dependency walker</em>; running this on our application i can see the fault address indeed lies withing the range for mfc42.dll (preferred base is <strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong> and followed by 0x74320000). </p>\n\n<p>(Auxilliary question regarding the MAP file for mfc42.dll at my disposal:\nits date is much earlier the dll's (map is 1998 - dll is 2007..). I would think these dates should be similar if not identical for the MAP file to be meaningful? I'm going to give it a try anyway:)</p>\n\n<p>The mfc42.map states a preferred load address of <strong><em>5f400000</em></strong>. I presume this is different from the address i got for mfc42.dll from <em>dependency walker</em> due to conflict and relocation, correct? In any case I guess this is still usable if i can work out the offset of the fault address from the relocated preferred load address. It appears to me that this offset may be already given from the application event (<strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong>); note it's remarkable lower part similarity to the system event's <strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong> (which i assume is an absolute address reference). It would be quite nice if subtracting the first from the latter would give the prefered load address for mfc42.dll.. but it does not. Subtraction gives <strong><em>0x73eb0000</em></strong> and not <strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>And vice versa, i would think that subtracting the preferred load address of mfc42.dll (<strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong>) from the absolute faulting address given in the system event (<strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong>) should give me the offset of the fault address. Ok, this gives 0x106e12 which not only is different to that given in the application event but more importantly, adding it to the preferred load address stated in mfc42.map yields an address out of range of the public symbols..</p>\n\n<p>It seems the only path leading to an actual public symbol in mfc42.dll is adding <strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong> (applicatoin event) and 5f400000 (preferred load address from mfc42.map) which gives a function that however is never used from our application (maybe used via another dll??)</p>\n\n<p>Your comments would be most valued.. I'm utilizing this case to familiarise myself with postmortem debugging but comments as to the specific bug are also welcome (for instance, regarding <em>Socket Notification Sink</em>). Lastly and most importantly, any general suggestions on remote/postmortem debugging?

Still no progress on loading the panels from Firefox on my windows desktop.  However, I fired up Firefox on my linux dev server, grabbed the bookmarklet, then went to the home page of my app and clicked on it.  Filled in the password, and when it reloaded, got a 500 error.

On that page, is a form whose action attribute is servlet/LoginServlet.  When the user submits the form, it calls servlet/LoginServlet, which is mapped to a class in the web.xml file.  Let's call this class com.mysite.mypkg.classA.  In class A, it calls a method from another class called com.custom.mypkg.classB.  I want to put a breakpoint in classB.  </p>\n\n<p>So, using the url with login.jsp page in the Eclipse debugger won't call it.

Fine, seems to work, I can step through my code in eclipse.  Only problem is that, because of the \"suspend=y\", I can't use the \"hadoop\" command from the command line to do things like look at the job queue; it hangs, I'm imagining because it's waiting for a debugger to attach.

What is eclipse doing when I run a mapreduce job from eclipse?  I had to reference hadoop-core in my pom.xml in order to make my project work.

Here is a some example code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import sys\nimport linecache           \n\ndef trace_calls(frame, event, arg): \n    if event != 'call':    \n        return             \n    co = frame.f_code      \n    func_name = co.co_name \n    if func_name == 'write':\n        return             \n    return trace_lines\n\ndef trace_lines(frame, event, arg): \n    if event != 'line':\n        return\n    co = frame.f_code\n    line_no = frame.f_lineno\n    filename = co.co_filename\n    print(\"%d %s\"%(line_no, linecache.getline(filename, line_no)[:-1]))\n\ndef some_elses_code():\n    j = 0\n    for i in xrange(0,5):\n       j = j + i\n    return j\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sys.settrace(trace_calls)\n    some_elses_code()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the output for the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>22     j = 0\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n25     return j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know I could just look at the line number, see that the line that had been executed was not the next line, but that feels wrong.  I would like to inspect the frame object that is passed into the trace_lines method and see that the iterator that is used in the for loop has no more items.  <a href=\"http://effbot.org/zone/python-for-statement.htm%20This%20link\" rel=\"nofollow\">This link</a> says that the for loop catches an exception, then it knows that the iterator is all used up, but I am not able to see the any exception objects populated on the frame object (ie frame.f_exc_value is always None).  Furthermore, I see no var in my local scope that is the iterator used in the for loop.  Is something like this possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","debugging","google-chrome","memory-leaks","profiler"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":219,"score":2,"question_id":9502929,"title":"Why does my Chrome Profiler doesn't show proper retaining paths for my objects and my objects never released?","body":"<p>I am trying to debug memory leaks in my webapp.</p>\n\n<p>I take snapshots of the heap and compare different heaps.</p>\n\n<p>I found out that some of my objects are being references somewhere.\nHowever, all of my objects are being retained through objects that looks internal to me, eg:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P15ui.png\" alt=\"Profiler showing my classes being referenced\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, this <em>SectionNavView</em> object is being referenced by a few methods that I have created: cleanUp, hide, isShown, etc. using my local variable that, but these methods are being referenced from something that I do not control: <em>idToWrappedObject</em>.

I even deleted the whole folder (<code>C:\\ProgramData\\MyApp</code>), and the app is still loading it.

Maybe LLDB is still too new, but I'm getting a lot of debugger crashes / deadlocks and even when that doesn't happen it does't seem to work like I expected.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to put together a debug wrapper around all selector calls, to extract the message call graph inside a certain chunk of code. (I could explain why if you really want to know, but it isn't really relevant to the debugger issue.)</p>\n\n<p>I start out with an Xcode breakpoint on the line where I want to start tracking things (for bonus points, this is happening on a secondary thread, but before you ask, no, nothing on any other thread is doing any accesses to this object or anything in its property subgraph):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[myObject startProcessing];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The breakpoint triggers, and I run \"bt\", just to extract:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* thread #5: tid = 0x2203, 0x000277d2 .........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then do something mildly evil: I put a breakpoint in objc_msgSend, right at the instruction where it calls out to the real object selector. objc_msgSend looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libobjc.A.dylib`objc_msgSend:\n...(instructions)...\n0x37babfa4:  bx     r12\n...(more instructions)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Actually there are two bx calls but let's keep things simple.) I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint set -a 0x37babfa4 -t 0x2203\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(TID included because I'm having enough trouble tracking this one thread and I don't need irrelevant stuff interfering.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's where the scripting comes in. The setup described above works exactly as I'd like it to. If I resume execution until the breakpoint triggers, I can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>frame select 0\nthread step-inst -m this-thread 5\nframe info\ncontinue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the effect will be that the debugger:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>moves to the objc_msgSend frame</li>\n<li>steps by one instruction, advancing it into the object selector frame it was pointing at</li>\n<li>displays relevant details (object type, selector called)</li>\n<li>resumes execution</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>at which point I can keep pasting in those four commands over and over and copying the output until I hate myself.</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s command\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and paste in those <em>exact same commands</em>, everything breaks. It does not advance to the object selector frame. It doesn't show the frame details, or at least not the correct ones -- depending on various tweaks (see below), it may or may not show \"objc_msgSend\" as being the current function. It doesn't resume execution.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, if I could get that example working, I'd be mostly happy. But for even more bonus points, I've also tried this with python, which I would prefer because it would allow for much more sophisticated logging:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s python\n&gt; thread = frame.GetThread()\n&gt; thread.StepInstruction(1)\n&gt; newFrame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(0)\n&gt; print \" \" * thread.GetNumFrames() + newFrame.GetFunctionName()\n&gt; process = thread.GetProcess()\n&gt; process.Continue()\n&gt; DONE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again no good. Again depending on tiny details, this may or may not print <em>something</em> (usually objc_msgSend), but it never prints the correct thing. It never steps the instruction forward. It never resumes execution afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>And again, the python version works fine if I do it by hand: if I wait till the breakpoint fires, then run \"script\" and enter those exact same lines, it works as expected. Some parts will even work in isolation, e.g. if I remove everything except the parts that get the process and call process.Continue() and trigger those automatically, that \"works\" (meaning I see the lldb prompt flashing rapidly as it suspends and resumes execution. Usually I regret this because it becomes unresponsive and crashes shortly after.)</p>\n\n<p>So: Any ideas? Is the technology Not Ready Yet, or am I just missing some clever piece of the puzzle that will fix everything? Or should I give up entirely and just live with the fact that there are some parts of object internals that I will never understand?...</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","cocoa-touch","debugging","gdb","lldb"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":433,"score":2,"question_id":10427496,"title":"Unable to set a watchpoint in either gdb or lldb","body":"<p>I am trying to set a watchpoint while debugging my app on the device.

Data size is usually 100-1000 records of 4-8 fields most containing real number values (float/double in C terms).</p>\n\n<p>Language:\n- Java I would throw out right away since the fact that it's a proces srunning in a virtual machine adds another layer and could sslow things down.\n- C#/C++ .NET versions, this is a bit faster then Java and the easiest/nices for me to work in but the .NET framework could slow things down and I'm worried about the speed of the.NETR database interfaces.\n- C++ (GNU flavor), as this is the closest to hardware without going to assembler, this would be my best option.

When I  enter a new string, resetting the tree, dark magic happens. What I expected to it do is: call <code>drawRootSlot()</code>,  deleting the whole tree (<code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>), draw a new root node. And, if I put a debugger breakpoint inside <code>drawRootSlot()</code> this is exactly what happens! But when I run it (without breakpoints), what I get is this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NT4wy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The previous tree got mangled, but not deleted. The scene gets indeed cleared of its items (printed that) but the view  does not reflect that. But again, when I put a breakpoint inside <code>drawRootSlot()</code> thhe view and the scene are in sync.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to delete the scene object, and instaciate a new one instead of calling <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>, to guarantee it empty. Then the changes are reflected on the view (the first time drawing always works).</p>\n\n<p>So, I have no idea what to deduce from these symptoms. It works as expected with a breakpoint or with a freshh <code>QGraphicsScene</code> object. It does not when just using <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>. One couldsay I just messed up the parent-object/child-object relation, but <code>clear()</code> <em>does</em> remove items from the view... I tried calling it right after <code>c_scene-&gt;addItem()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What is this sorrcery? One that makes me believe I'm not actually stupid?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Whats interesting and may be a hint to the real problem, is that when <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code> is called, the edges of the tree, which are normal <code>QGraphicsLineItem</code>s, are indeed deleted in all cases (breakpoint or not).

I'm on Win XP SP3, using the builtin IIS 5.1.</p>\n\n<p>It started a few weeks ago, and happens across multiple projects. Something clearly changed in my environment, because it was working fine in the past, even in recent IDEs as long as I Attach to process. Then it broke as described below. I'd given up on it, but I started working on a new project recently, tried to debug and it worked! Today, though, it's back to the same broken behavior:</p>\n\n<p>When I try to set a breakpoint, the IDE actually sets the point a few lines above or below the line I clicked. I'm trying to set the breakpoint on lines that are entirely server-side code, so it's not because it's skipping before or after HTML with embedded code nuggets. Occasionally it won't set the breakpoint, giving me a hollow breakpoint icon and presenting an error that says there's no executable code on the line.</p>\n\n<p>When I attach to the IIS process (inetinfo.dll, as I'm running in low isolation mode), the breakpoint may not be hit. If it is, and I start single-stepping, the selected line jumps around, and doesn't land on every continuous line in the source, nor follow control structures as expected. Watched variables are not updated as expected. It's clearly seeing different code than I do for the same line numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The same behavior happens whether I load the page in a browser and</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attach to the process from VS2010, set a breakpoint and refresh the page, or</li>\n<li>set the breakpoint, attach to the process, and refresh, or</li>\n<li>add a 'stop' statement in my source, and refresh the page. In that case, I'm presented a list of available debuggers, and every one of them does exactly the same thing -- they skip the SAME lines of code and follow the SAME 'incorrect' paths. I've tried VS2010, 2008, 2005, 2003, and the Microsoft Script Debugger. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the source code is out of sync with what the debugger is stepping through. I've made certain that 'Require source files to exactly match the original version' is set in VS > Tools >Options > Debugging > General</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, these are ASP Classic sites -- there's no compiled code, so the source I see in the IDE should be the same as what the debugger's executing. It's not specific to one project -- it's happening on at least two completely separate projects at the moment. And, it's happening on multiple machines -- I deployed my project to a test server and tried to debug there, and got the same behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I found some information on similar-sounding problems related to UTF-encoded files containing non-ANSI characters (you know, the ones you use Unicode to support!) <a href=\"http://forums.iis.net/p/1096231/1655541.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928452\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiodev.com/visual-studio-debugger/incorrect-line-highlighted-when-debugging-serverside-with-asp-classic-16890.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I went thru my source and can't find any files like that.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

I tend to alternate between working heavily in Java and sql, so I first noticed the problem when returning to Java with no clear reason or cause to it.

Cleaning/rebuilding doesn't work, either. </p>\n\n<p>When set to debug, if a breakpoint is hit Eclipse will prompt to enter debug mode as expected. The perspective will switch over, but the file with the breakpoint will not open, and if it is already open then the line will not be targeted and highlighted. In the Debug View, it lists the location of cursor during debug, such as \"Daemon Thread [http-8080-Processor23] (Suspended (breakpoint at line 91 in CLASS))\", so I know that the thread suspends correctly.  If I F6 (Step Over) I can see it going through the lines of code as expected, but nothing is highlighted or jumped to in the main window. </p>\n\n<p>This project is a jsp-based web app. If I switch workspaces into a small single-class project that just does some read-write on some excel files, then debugging works as expected.

(Visual Studio 2010)","body":"<p>Hello fellow programmers!</p>\n\n<p>This is a question towards  programmers who have experience with using Visual Studio 2010 for debugging external applications.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I'm developping an add-on for a program made by people I work for. In order to make this add-on work with the external program, I have to place the .dll file in a certain folder, specified by the external program. I have my build settings configurated so the .dll file is copied automatically. I also copy the .pdb file to enable debugging options.</p>\n\n<p>Since this add-on is nothing but a class library, I can't debug it like I normally would. I also don't have the source code for the external application. How should I debug this class library properly?</p>\n\n<p>This is what I tried:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Attach to Process</strong><br>\nSee <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6wf8e4z.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attach to a Running Process</a>. This seems to work fine, except it takes a few seconds to set up. That's a problem, because most of the exceptions/breakpoints occur at the very first seconds of the start of the external program. It also becomes annoying to manually attach Visual Studio to a process, because I debug this class library a lot, thus taking a lot of time after a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Debugger.Launch()</strong><br>\nCurrently I use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debugger.launch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debugger.Launch()</a> to attach Visual Studio to the external program. This will display a Just In Time prompt, asking me which instance of Visual Studio I would like to use. I find this to be much slower than \"Attach to Process\", but this way I am sure that the debugger is attached before any breakpoints can occur. Placing this between <code>#if DEBUG</code> and <code>#end if</code> makes sure this popup doesn't show when I create a release build, which helps too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Add as Existing Project</strong><br>\nI've added the executable of the program as a project to my solution. By doing this I can set this executable as startup project, and pressing F5 will start it. The biggest advantage of this, is that I can now debug the executable as soon at is it is started. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0bxe8ytt.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug an Executable Not Part of a Visual Studio Solution</a>. With this, Visual Studio breaks at exceptions, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to load the breakpoints. The following information is shown when I try using breakpoints:\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5itdQ.png\" alt=\"breakpoint\">\nThe modules window displays: \"Binary was not built with debug information.\". Can this be solved?</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Start Action</strong><br>\nSilentDoc noted that I can also set an external program as start action, using Properties -> Debug -> Start Action. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/68c8335t.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Change the Start Action for Application Debugging</a> It appears to load the breakpoints correctly this way. However, for some reason this makes the external program freeze for <strong>5 minutes</strong> at the first breakpoint/exception encountered. After it is done freezing, things seem to work as expected. What could cause this freeze?</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Image File Execution Options</strong><br>\nAs hmemcpy suggested, I can also use \"Image File Execution Options\" for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a329t4ed.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launching the Debugger Automatically</a>. This seems to be the same as Debugger.Launch(), since it displays the same Just In Time prompt. However, this Just In Time \"debugger\" doesn't debug at all: breakpoints and exceptions are ignored. Also, when working with a release build, I can't simply disable the Just In Time prompt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nOption 1 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but takes too much time.<br>\nOption 2 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but is too slow.<br>\nOption 3 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.<br>\nOption 4 loads breakpoints, but freezes for 5 minutes at first breakpoint/exception.<br>\nOption 5 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional information</strong><br>\nThe external program and class library are both written in VB.NET, I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, and the target framework is .NET Framework 4.0.  </p>\n\n<p>Option 1 and 2 work for me, but after a while, all those dialogs and prompts become annoying, and slow me down. Option 3 and 4 seem more suitable for me, so if anyone can tell me how to get them to work, that would be great. Option 5 doesn't seem that interesting either, I don't want to be using regedit.exe all the time. If there are any other options, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Ruud Lenders</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","debugging","debugview"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":126,"score":0,"question_id":12494300,"title":"No output from DebugView","body":"<p>I've installed DebugView 4.79 on Windows 7 and Windows 8 64 bit machines and a Windows 7 32 bit machine.

I have been able to reproduce the behavior in a smaller test app with more reliable triggering of the erratic behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I can definitely rule out both threading and (I think) memory issues. The new app uses no Tasks or other threading/asynchronous features, and I can trigger the unhandled exception simply by adding properties that return a constant to the class of objects shown in the DataGrid. This indicates to me that the problem is either in unmanaged resource exhaustion or something I haven't thought of yet.</p>\n\n<p>The revised program is structured like this. I have created a user control called <code>EntityCollectionGridView</code> which has a label and a data grid. In the control's Loaded event handler, I assign a <code>List&lt;TestClass&gt;</code> to the data grid with 1000 or 10000 rows, letting the grid generate the columns. This user control is instantiated 2-4 times in MainPage.xaml in the page's <code>OnNavigatedTo</code> event (or <code>Loaded</code>, it doesn't seem to matter). If an exception occurs, it occurs immediately after MainPage is shown.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is, the behavior doesn't seem to vary with the number of rows shown (it will work reliably with 10000 rows or fail reliably with only 1000 rows in each grid) but rather with the total number of columns in all the grids loaded at a given time. With 20 properties to show, 4 grids works fine. With 35 properties and 4 grids, the exception is thrown. But if I eliminate two grids, the same class with 35 properties will work fine.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of the properties I add to <code>TestClass</code> to jump from 20 to 35 columns are of the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string StringXYZ { get { return \"asdfasdfasdfasdfasf\"; } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, there's no additional memory in the backing data (and again, I don't think memory pressure is the problem anyway).</p>\n\n<p>What do you all think? Again, the handles/user objects/etc in Task Manager look good, but is there something else I might be missing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original post</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have been working on a port of the Silverlight Toolkit DataGrid to WinRT, and it has done well enough in simple tests (a variety of configurations and up to 10000 rows). However, as I have tried to embed it into another WinRT app I have run into a sporadic exception (of type System.Exception, raised in the App.UnhandledException handler) that is proving very difficult to debug.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Not enough quota is available to process this command. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070718)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The error is consistently reproducible, but not deterministically. That is, I can make it happen every time I run the App, but it doesn't always happen by performing the same exact set of steps the same number of times. The error seems to occur on page transitions (whether navigating to a new page forward or back to a previous page), and not (for instance) when changing the ItemsSource of the datagrid.</p>\n\n<p>The application structure is basically recursive access through a hierarchy, with a page shown at each hierarchy level. On the page for the current node in the hierarchy, each child node and some grandchild nodes are shown, and for any subnode a datagrid may be shown. In practice, I consistently reproduce this with the following navigation structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Root page: shows no datagrid\n  Child page: shows one datagrid and a few listviews\n    Grandchild page: shows two datagrids, one bound to the\n                     same source as Child page, the other one empty\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A typical test scenario is, start at Root, move to Child, move to Grandchild, move back to Child, and then when I try to navigate to Grandchild again, it fails with the exception I mentioned above. But it might fail the first time I hit Grandchild, or it might let me move back and forth a few times before failing.</p>\n\n<p>The call stack has only one managed frame on it, which is the unhandled exception event handler. This is very unhelpful. Switching to mixed mode debugging, I get the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WinRTClient.exe!WinRTClient.App.InitializeComponent.AnonymousMethod__14(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e) Line 50 + 0x20 bytes  C#\n[Native to Managed Transition]  \nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::CFTMEventSource&lt;Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventHandler,Windows::UI::Xaml::IApplication,Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventArgs&gt;::Raise(Windows::UI::Xaml::IApplication * pSource, Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventArgs * pArgs)  Line 327  C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::Application::RaiseUnhandledExceptionEventHelper(long hrEncountered, unsigned short * pszErrorMessage, unsigned int * pfIsHandled)  Line 920 + 0xa bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::ErrorHelper::CallAUHandler(unsigned int errorCode, unsigned int * pfIsHandled, wchar_t * * pbstrErrorMessage)  Line 39 + 0x14 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::ErrorHelper::ProcessUnhandledErrorForUserCode(long error)  Line 82 + 0x10 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!AgCoreCallbacks::CallAUHandler(unsigned int errorCode)  Line 1104 + 0x8 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CCoreServices::ReportUnhandledError(long errorXR)  Line 6582    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::Tick()  Line 1126 + 0xb bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::OnReentrancyProtectedWindowMessage(HWND__ * hwnd, unsigned int msg, unsigned int wParam, long lParam)  Line 653 C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::WindowProc(HWND__ * hwnd, unsigned int msg, unsigned int wParam, long lParam)  Line 401 + 0x24 bytes    C++\nuser32.dll!_InternalCallWinProc@20()  + 0x23 bytes  \nuser32.dll!_UserCallWinProcCheckWow@36()  + 0xbd bytes  \nuser32.dll!_DispatchMessageWorker@8()  + 0xf8 bytes \nuser32.dll!_DispatchMessageW@4()  + 0x10 bytes  \nWindows.UI.dll!Windows::UI::Core::CDispatcher::ProcessMessage(int bDrainQueue, int * pbAnyMessages)  Line 121   C++\nWindows.UI.dll!Windows::UI::Core::CDispatcher::ProcessEvents(Windows::UI::Core::CoreProcessEventsOption options)  Line 184 + 0x10 bytes C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CJupiterWindow::RunCoreWindowMessageLoop()  Line 416 + 0xb bytes    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CJupiterControl::RunMessageLoop()  Line 714 + 0x5 bytes C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::DXamlCore::RunMessageLoop()  Line 2539 + 0x5 bytes    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::FrameworkView::Run()  Line 91 C++\ntwinapi.dll!`Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationViewAgileContainer::RuntimeClassInitialize'::`55'::&lt;lambda_A2234BA2CCD64E2C&gt;::operator()(void * pv)  Line 560  C++\ntwinapi.dll!`Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationViewAgileContainer::RuntimeClassInitialize'::`55'::&lt;lambda_A2234BA2CCD64E2C&gt;::&lt;helper_func&gt;(void * pv)  Line 613 + 0xe bytes   C++\nSHCore.dll!_SHWaitForThreadWithWakeMask@12()  + 0xceab bytes    \nkernel32.dll!@BaseThreadInitThunk@12()  + 0xe bytes \nntdll.dll!___RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x27 bytes   \nntdll.dll!__RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x1b bytes    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This indicates to me that whatever I'm doing wrong doesn't register until after at least one cycle in the app's message loop (and I also tried breaking on all thrown exceptions using \"Debug | Exceptions...\" -- as far as I can tell, nothing is thrown and swallowed). The interesting stack frames I see are <code>WindowProc</code>, <code>OnReentrancyProtectedWindowMessage</code>, and <code>Tick</code>. The <code>msg</code> is 0x402 (1026), which doesn't mean anything to me. <a href=\"http://wiki.winehq.org/List_Of_Windows_Messages\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> lists that message as used in the following contexts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CBEM_SETIMAGELIST \nDDM_CLOSE \nDM_REPOSITION \nHKM_GETHOTKEY \nPBM_SETPOS \nRB_DELETEBAND \nSB_GETTEXTA \nTB_CHECKBUTTON \nTBM_GETRANGEMAX \nWM_PSD_MINMARGINRECT\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but that doesn't mean anything much to me, either (it might not even be relevant).</p>\n\n<p>The three theories I can come up with are these:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Memory pressure.</strong> But I have run into this with 24% of my physical memory free and the app consuming less than 100MB of memory. Other times, the app won't have hit any problems navigating around a while and racking up 400MB of memory</li>\n<li><strong>Threading problems,</strong> such as access to the UI thread from a worker thread. And, in fact, I do have data access happening on a background thread. But this is using a (ported) framework that has been very reliable in a WinForms environment and in an Outlook plugin, and I think the thread use is safe. Additionally, I can use the same data in this app without any problems binding just to ListViews and so forth. Finally, the Grandchild node is configured such that selecting a row in the first datagrid kicks off a request for the row's detail items, which are displayed in the second datagrid (which is initially empty, and can remain so without preventing the exception). This happens without a page transition and works flawlessly for as long as I choose to fiddle with the selection. But navigating back to Child might kill me right away, even though there should be no data access at that point and therefore not threading operations that I know of.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource exhaustion</strong> of some kind, maybe GUI handles. But I don't think I'm putting that much pressure on this system. In one execution, breaking in the exception handler, Task Manager reports the process using 662 handles, 21 User objects, and 12 GDI objects, as compared to Tweetro which is using 734, 37, and 19 respectively without problems. What else might I be missing in this category?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have plenty of disk space free, and am not using the disk for anything other than configuration files anyway (and all that worked fine before adding the datagrids).</p>\n\n<p>My next thought was to try to step through some of the potential 'interesting' parts of the datagrid code and jump over any that were questionable. I did try that with the datagrid's ArrangeOverride, but the exception didn't seem to care whether I did that or not. Also, I am not sure this is a useful strategy. Since the exception isn't being thrown until after a cycle on the message loop, and since I can't know for sure when it's about to happen, I would need to cover a huge number of permutations, running each permutation a whole lot of times, to isolate the problem code.</p>\n\n<p>The error is thrown in both Debug and Release modes. And, as a final background note, the amount of data we're dealing with here is small, much smaller than my 10000-row runs of the datagrid in isolation. It's probably on the order of 50-100 rows, with perhaps 30-40 columns.
