Just recently my iOS app began to fail with the dreaded <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> error. I did a lot of research on SO and Google and received some great advice, but none of the posts have helped me to resolve my issue. By now, I understand that EXC_BAD_ACCESS could be one of two things:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1) A pointer is now pointing to memory that was deallocated.\n2) A pointer itself is corrupt.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I read and followed the instructions <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3111585/tracking-down-exc-bad-access-without-nszombie\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://loufranco.com/blog/files/Understanding-EXC_BAD_ACCESS.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327082/exc-bad-access-signal-received\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://mobiledevelopertips.com/debugging/tracking-down-exc_bad_access-errors-with-nszombieenabled.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. When I perform \"Build and Run\" I can reproduce the exc_bad_access 100% of the time.  However, when I enabled NSZombie in either the debugger or in Instruments, I <strong>never</strong> can reproduce the issue. Furthermore, NSZombie does not leave any helpful information in the console.</p>\n\n<p>The closest I got to pinpointing the issue was by literally putting an NSLog after every single line of code, in order to see where it was crashing.  I believe that it is crashing at two distinct points - both of which are returning a cell in the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code>. Below I'm providing the two methods where I believe things are crashing, as well as the error output on my console. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>\n\n<p>The offending method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath

As it's quite heavy on STL, I'd really like to use a GDB version with python support (i.e. >=v7) for pretty printing of containers. My application is split up into a backend library (.dylib) that does all the heavy lifting, and a very simple frontend application. All of the sources and binaries are below a common source path, and everything has been compiled with debugging symbols (I tried both -g and -ggdb).</p>\n\n<p>Using the GDB version in XCode (which identifies as \"GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1820)\"), displaying the source lines of frames in a backtrace works as expected out of the box, no matter whether the respective call happens in the frontend app or the backend library:</p>\n\n<p>(gdb) f 12</p>\n\n<p>#12 0x000000010002ddc5 in FL3D::Resource::createMesh_ (this=0x7fff5fbff7c8, fl3d=@0x7fff5fbff1f8, id=) at /Development/workspace/fl3d/libfl3d/resource.cpp:234</p>\n\n<p>234             std::vector&amp; t = textureIndices_.at(i);</p>\n\n<p>(gdb)</p>\n\n<p>So far so good.

Interestingly, though, it DOES show the corresponding source line for calls in the frontend's main() function!</p>\n\n<p>I've already tried manually setting the path to the library's source files with \"dir libfl3d\", but that doesn't change anything. I also notice that gdb6 says \"Reading symbols for shared libraries\" a few times when I run the application and gdb7 doesn't – but the symbols don't seem to be the problem, as they seem to be resolved correctly by both versions?</p>\n\n<p>I'm at my wit's end here.

At this point, I don't know why.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't dug in further to see which behavior(s) of the libraries (or the dependent code in my app) are affecting the tests. A quick grep didn't return anything using Kernel#at_exit and a quick glance of the source on each of those didn't turn up anything either. I'll keep digging, but that's what I found out so far. </p>\n\n<p>I haven't filed bug reports, as I don't yet know what the problem is.</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","visual-studio-2012"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13139226,"title":"Cannot debug managed code in Visual Studio 2012","body":"<p>I am unable to get the debugger to work on an ASP.NET MVC website in Visual Studio 2012.

object, I think that particular thing changed between 1.4.0 and 1.5.0, so, whilst the original call to the launch() method was like:</p>\n\n<p>app.launch();</p>\n\n<p>I found out that that wouldn't work in 2.1.0 and that I could call it like:</p>\n\n<p>app.app.launch();</p>\n\n<p>This works allright in Chrome where calling fireCreateLocalStore() from the code I pasted above ends calling it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I compile this in Eclipse and deploy it with the debug option, I see the logcat going through the creation of the database objects (just before) and when it hits the launch() line I get the error from the title : Uncaught ReferenceError: app is not defined</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing the offending global to something less conflicting, like MyApp in the html and App.js (plus

I'm aware that you can put a hit-count on regular break points, and you can just set the value really high to stop it from actually breaking at these points, but break point counters aren't immediately visible, so you have to hover over them one by one to see where execution stopped.  This would provide an immediate trail leading right to the point where things went wrong - like following the missing dots to figure out where Pacman is.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just curious if anyone's seen a plug-in out there that can do this sort of thing or if I'm just dreaming here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","reverse-engineering","ollydbg"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13076637,"title":"Determining the rate at which a function is called with OllyDbg","body":"<p>How can I find out how many times per second a particular function is called using OllyDbg?

Every once in a while (every few months or so) the application crashes due to an unhandled exception. Obviously, we have a release executable running on prod and that is not about to change. </p>\n\n<p>Examining the latest crash:</p>\n\n<p>Two events (event viewer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>APPLICATION Event (error):</strong> \n  \"Faulting application XXX , faulting module mfc42.dll, version 6.6.8032.0, fault address <strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong>\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>SYSTEM Event: Information (Application Popup)</strong>\n  \"Socket Notification Sink: XXX application error: The instruction at <strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong> referenced memory at 0xd4273c00. The memory could not be read\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, I'm rather inexperienced with remote debugging but I'm trying to make use of this information along with the MAP files available. Any input towards the right direction would help..</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the exception is fired from within the mf42.dll. I can also verify this by using a utility called <em>dependency walker</em>; running this on our application i can see the fault address indeed lies withing the range for mfc42.dll (preferred base is <strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong> and followed by 0x74320000). </p>\n\n<p>(Auxilliary question regarding the MAP file for mfc42.dll at my disposal:\nits date is much earlier the dll's (map is 1998 - dll is 2007..). I would think these dates should be similar if not identical for the MAP file to be meaningful? I'm going to give it a try anyway:)</p>\n\n<p>The mfc42.map states a preferred load address of <strong><em>5f400000</em></strong>. I presume this is different from the address i got for mfc42.dll from <em>dependency walker</em> due to conflict and relocation, correct? In any case I guess this is still usable if i can work out the offset of the fault address from the relocated preferred load address. It appears to me that this offset may be already given from the application event (<strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong>); note it's remarkable lower part similarity to the system event's <strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong> (which i assume is an absolute address reference). It would be quite nice if subtracting the first from the latter would give the prefered load address for mfc42.dll.. but it does not. Subtraction gives <strong><em>0x73eb0000</em></strong> and not <strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>And vice versa, i would think that subtracting the preferred load address of mfc42.dll (<strong><em>0x73dd0000</em></strong>) from the absolute faulting address given in the system event (<strong><em>0x73ed6e12</em></strong>) should give me the offset of the fault address. Ok, this gives 0x106e12 which not only is different to that given in the application event but more importantly, adding it to the preferred load address stated in mfc42.map yields an address out of range of the public symbols..</p>\n\n<p>It seems the only path leading to an actual public symbol in mfc42.dll is adding <strong><em>0x00026e12</em></strong> (applicatoin event) and 5f400000 (preferred load address from mfc42.map) which gives a function that however is never used from our application (maybe used via another dll??)</p>\n\n<p>Your comments would be most valued.. I'm utilizing this case to familiarise myself with postmortem debugging but comments as to the specific bug are also welcome (for instance, regarding <em>Socket Notification Sink</em>). Lastly and most importantly, any general suggestions on remote/postmortem debugging?

Unfortunately, it's been very difficult and time-consuming trying to trace errors reported by Apache Tomcat 5.5, my JSP/servlet engine.

I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n<p>I added the JVM argument to Tomcat, restarted Tomcat.  Then, on the machine with Eclipse, I entered in the appropriate info in the Debug config, put the breakpoint in, and tested.  Unfortunately, it did not work.  In the config, I left it as Socket Attach, clicked apply, and that was it.  I pressed the debug button and it said the connection was refused.  I tried ports 8000 and 8001 and both did not work.  </p>\n\n<p>Let me explain what I'm trying to do, that might be better.</p>\n\n<p>I have a login page called login.jsp.  On that page, is a form whose action attribute is servlet/LoginServlet.  When the user submits the form, it calls servlet/LoginServlet, which is mapped to a class in the web.xml file.  Let's call this class com.mysite.mypkg.classA.  In class A, it calls a method from another class called com.custom.mypkg.classB.  I want to put a breakpoint in classB.  </p>\n\n<p>So, using the url with login.jsp page in the Eclipse debugger won't call it.  I tried using servlet/LoginServlet and that also did not work.  </p>\n\n<p>What should I put in for the URL? Or, do I debug this type of setup?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found this site <a href=\"http://jaykhimani.blogspot.com/2009/05/remote-debugging-java-applications.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, which is pretty comprehensive.

Fine, seems to work, I can step through my code in eclipse.  Only problem is that, because of the \"suspend=y\", I can't use the \"hadoop\" command from the command line to do things like look at the job queue; it hangs, I'm imagining because it's waiting for a debugger to attach.  Also, I can't run \"hbase shell\" when I'm in this mode, probably for the same reason.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, if I want to flip back and forth between \"debug mode\" and \"normal mode\", I need to update hadoop-env.sh and restart my machine.

Are there any processes on my machine that are \"always on\" and executing hadoop jobs?  Or does hadoop only do things when I run the \"hadoop\" command from the command line?  What is eclipse doing when I run a mapreduce job from eclipse?  I had to reference hadoop-core in my pom.xml in order to make my project work.

Here is a some example code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import sys\nimport linecache           \n\ndef trace_calls(frame, event, arg): \n    if event != 'call':    \n        return             \n    co = frame.f_code      \n    func_name = co.co_name \n    if func_name == 'write':\n        return             \n    return trace_lines\n\ndef trace_lines(frame, event, arg): \n    if event != 'line':\n        return\n    co = frame.f_code\n    line_no = frame.f_lineno\n    filename = co.co_filename\n    print(\"%d %s\"%(line_no, linecache.getline(filename, line_no)[:-1]))\n\ndef some_elses_code():\n    j = 0\n    for i in xrange(0,5):\n       j = j + i\n    return j\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sys.settrace(trace_calls)\n    some_elses_code()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the output for the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>22     j = 0\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n24         j = j + i\n23     for i in xrange(0,5):\n25     return j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know I could just look at the line number, see that the line that had been executed was not the next line, but that feels wrong.  I would like to inspect the frame object that is passed into the trace_lines method and see that the iterator that is used in the for loop has no more items.  <a href=\"http://effbot.org/zone/python-for-statement.htm%20This%20link\" rel=\"nofollow\">This link</a> says that the for loop catches an exception, then it knows that the iterator is all used up, but I am not able to see the any exception objects populated on the frame object (ie frame.f_exc_value is always None).  Furthermore, I see no var in my local scope that is the iterator used in the for loop.  Is something like this possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","debugging","google-chrome","memory-leaks","profiler"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":222,"score":2,"question_id":9502929,"title":"Why does my Chrome Profiler doesn't show proper retaining paths for my objects and my objects never released?","body":"<p>I am trying to debug memory leaks in my webapp.</p>\n\n<p>I take snapshots of the heap and compare different heaps.</p>\n\n<p>I found out that some of my objects are being references somewhere.\nHowever, all of my objects are being retained through objects that looks internal to me, eg:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P15ui.png\" alt=\"Profiler showing my classes being referenced\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, this <em>SectionNavView</em> object is being referenced by a few methods that I have created: cleanUp, hide, isShown, etc. using my local variable that, but these methods are being referenced from something that I do not control: <em>idToWrappedObject</em>.

I even deleted the whole folder (<code>C:\\ProgramData\\MyApp</code>), and the app is still loading it.

Maybe LLDB is still too new, but I'm getting a lot of debugger crashes / deadlocks and even when that doesn't happen it does't seem to work like I expected.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to put together a debug wrapper around all selector calls, to extract the message call graph inside a certain chunk of code. (I could explain why if you really want to know, but it isn't really relevant to the debugger issue.)</p>\n\n<p>I start out with an Xcode breakpoint on the line where I want to start tracking things (for bonus points, this is happening on a secondary thread, but before you ask, no, nothing on any other thread is doing any accesses to this object or anything in its property subgraph):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[myObject startProcessing];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The breakpoint triggers, and I run \"bt\", just to extract:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* thread #5: tid = 0x2203, 0x000277d2 .........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then do something mildly evil: I put a breakpoint in objc_msgSend, right at the instruction where it calls out to the real object selector. objc_msgSend looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libobjc.A.dylib`objc_msgSend:\n...(instructions)...\n0x37babfa4:  bx     r12\n...(more instructions)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Actually there are two bx calls but let's keep things simple.) I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint set -a 0x37babfa4 -t 0x2203\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(TID included because I'm having enough trouble tracking this one thread and I don't need irrelevant stuff interfering.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's where the scripting comes in. The setup described above works exactly as I'd like it to. If I resume execution until the breakpoint triggers, I can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>frame select 0\nthread step-inst -m this-thread 5\nframe info\ncontinue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the effect will be that the debugger:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>moves to the objc_msgSend frame</li>\n<li>steps by one instruction, advancing it into the object selector frame it was pointing at</li>\n<li>displays relevant details (object type, selector called)</li>\n<li>resumes execution</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>at which point I can keep pasting in those four commands over and over and copying the output until I hate myself.</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s command\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and paste in those <em>exact same commands</em>, everything breaks. It does not advance to the object selector frame. It doesn't show the frame details, or at least not the correct ones -- depending on various tweaks (see below), it may or may not show \"objc_msgSend\" as being the current function. It doesn't resume execution.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, if I could get that example working, I'd be mostly happy. But for even more bonus points, I've also tried this with python, which I would prefer because it would allow for much more sophisticated logging:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s python\n&gt; thread = frame.GetThread()\n&gt; thread.StepInstruction(1)\n&gt; newFrame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(0)\n&gt; print \" \" * thread.GetNumFrames() + newFrame.GetFunctionName()\n&gt; process = thread.GetProcess()\n&gt; process.Continue()\n&gt; DONE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again no good. Again depending on tiny details, this may or may not print <em>something</em> (usually objc_msgSend), but it never prints the correct thing. It never steps the instruction forward. It never resumes execution afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>And again, the python version works fine if I do it by hand: if I wait till the breakpoint fires, then run \"script\" and enter those exact same lines, it works as expected. Some parts will even work in isolation, e.g. if I remove everything except the parts that get the process and call process.Continue() and trigger those automatically, that \"works\" (meaning I see the lldb prompt flashing rapidly as it suspends and resumes execution. Usually I regret this because it becomes unresponsive and crashes shortly after.)</p>\n\n<p>So: Any ideas? Is the technology Not Ready Yet, or am I just missing some clever piece of the puzzle that will fix everything? Or should I give up entirely and just live with the fact that there are some parts of object internals that I will never understand?...</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","cocoa-touch","debugging","gdb","lldb"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":435,"score":2,"question_id":10427496,"title":"Unable to set a watchpoint in either gdb or lldb","body":"<p>I am trying to set a watchpoint while debugging my app on the device.

(ie: if turnaround time is 5-20ms faster then it's still a clear winner).</p>\n\n<p>Now this is what I am thinking:</p>\n\n<p>Windows vs Linux: while windows generally takes more resources, once the applications are running the OS shouldnt make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Database: My experience is as such - \nOracle, huge amounts of spatial data; \nMySQL/Postgres, large websites (forums, etc)\nMYSQL - middle tier for oracle backend for fin trnsactions.</p>\n\n<p>Now my gut feels tells me Oracle as it's the most stable and handles lare amounts of data, but is it fastest?\nThe data processing will be mostly reads (speed very imortant) and writes are not as mission critical, those will happen every 0.5 to 5 seconds. Data size is usually 100-1000 records of 4-8 fields most containing real number values (float/double in C terms).</p>\n\n<p>Language:\n- Java I would throw out right away since the fact that it's a proces srunning in a virtual machine adds another layer and could sslow things down.\n- C#/C++ .NET versions, this is a bit faster then Java and the easiest/nices for me to work in but the .NET framework could slow things down and I'm worried about the speed of the.NETR database interfaces.\n- C++ (GNU flavor), as this is the closest to hardware without going to assembler, this would be my best option. Only drawback is I don't know if there are any interfaces to the databases above and how much of a pain they are to use.</p>\n\n<p>So my own conclusion would be:\nOracle with a GNU C++ language interface. Unsure about windows or linux as yet, don't mind using either.  </p>\n\n<p>My biggest problem with using GNU C++ and linux is the debugging process, in windows C#/C++ I just use VStudio and am golden, are there any decent graphical debuggers/tools for the gnu compilers?</p>\n\n<p>I apologise for the length o the question but any comments and changes to my thinking process and conclusion would be appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","debugging"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12880884,"title":"Breakpoint on page reload in javascript","body":"<p>I am debugging foreign complicated js code.

When I  enter a new string, resetting the tree, dark magic happens. What I expected to it do is: call <code>drawRootSlot()</code>,  deleting the whole tree (<code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>), draw a new root node. And, if I put a debugger breakpoint inside <code>drawRootSlot()</code> this is exactly what happens!

The scene gets indeed cleared of its items (printed that) but the view  does not reflect that. But again, when I put a breakpoint inside <code>drawRootSlot()</code> thhe view and the scene are in sync.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to delete the scene object, and instaciate a new one instead of calling <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>, to guarantee it empty. Then the changes are reflected on the view (the first time drawing always works).</p>\n\n<p>So, I have no idea what to deduce from these symptoms. It works as expected with a breakpoint or with a freshh <code>QGraphicsScene</code> object. It does not when just using <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code>. One couldsay I just messed up the parent-object/child-object relation, but <code>clear()</code> <em>does</em> remove items from the view... I tried calling it right after <code>c_scene-&gt;addItem()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What is this sorrcery? One that makes me believe I'm not actually stupid?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Whats interesting and may be a hint to the real problem, is that when <code>c_scene-&gt;clear()</code> is called, the edges of the tree, which are normal <code>QGraphicsLineItem</code>s, are indeed deleted in all cases (breakpoint or not).

I'm on Win XP SP3, using the builtin IIS 5.1.</p>\n\n<p>It started a few weeks ago, and happens across multiple projects. Something clearly changed in my environment, because it was working fine in the past, even in recent IDEs as long as I Attach to process. Then it broke as described below. I'd given up on it, but I started working on a new project recently, tried to debug and it worked! Today, though, it's back to the same broken behavior:</p>\n\n<p>When I try to set a breakpoint, the IDE actually sets the point a few lines above or below the line I clicked. I'm trying to set the breakpoint on lines that are entirely server-side code, so it's not because it's skipping before or after HTML with embedded code nuggets. Occasionally it won't set the breakpoint, giving me a hollow breakpoint icon and presenting an error that says there's no executable code on the line.</p>\n\n<p>When I attach to the IIS process (inetinfo.dll, as I'm running in low isolation mode), the breakpoint may not be hit. If it is, and I start single-stepping, the selected line jumps around, and doesn't land on every continuous line in the source, nor follow control structures as expected. Watched variables are not updated as expected. It's clearly seeing different code than I do for the same line numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The same behavior happens whether I load the page in a browser and</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attach to the process from VS2010, set a breakpoint and refresh the page, or</li>\n<li>set the breakpoint, attach to the process, and refresh, or</li>\n<li>add a 'stop' statement in my source, and refresh the page. In that case, I'm presented a list of available debuggers, and every one of them does exactly the same thing -- they skip the SAME lines of code and follow the SAME 'incorrect' paths. I've tried VS2010, 2008, 2005, 2003, and the Microsoft Script Debugger. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the source code is out of sync with what the debugger is stepping through. I've made certain that 'Require source files to exactly match the original version' is set in VS > Tools >Options > Debugging > General</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, these are ASP Classic sites -- there's no compiled code, so the source I see in the IDE should be the same as what the debugger's executing. It's not specific to one project -- it's happening on at least two completely separate projects at the moment. And, it's happening on multiple machines -- I deployed my project to a test server and tried to debug there, and got the same behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I found some information on similar-sounding problems related to UTF-encoded files containing non-ANSI characters (you know, the ones you use Unicode to support!) <a href=\"http://forums.iis.net/p/1096231/1655541.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928452\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiodev.com/visual-studio-debugger/incorrect-line-highlighted-when-debugging-serverside-with-asp-classic-16890.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I went thru my source and can't find any files like that.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

(Visual Studio 2010)","body":"<p>Hello fellow programmers!</p>\n\n<p>This is a question towards  programmers who have experience with using Visual Studio 2010 for debugging external applications.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I'm developping an add-on for a program made by people I work for. In order to make this add-on work with the external program, I have to place the .dll file in a certain folder, specified by the external program. I have my build settings configurated so the .dll file is copied automatically. I also copy the .pdb file to enable debugging options.</p>\n\n<p>Since this add-on is nothing but a class library, I can't debug it like I normally would. I also don't have the source code for the external application. How should I debug this class library properly?</p>\n\n<p>This is what I tried:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Attach to Process</strong><br>\nSee <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6wf8e4z.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attach to a Running Process</a>. This seems to work fine, except it takes a few seconds to set up. That's a problem, because most of the exceptions/breakpoints occur at the very first seconds of the start of the external program. It also becomes annoying to manually attach Visual Studio to a process, because I debug this class library a lot, thus taking a lot of time after a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Debugger.Launch()</strong><br>\nCurrently I use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debugger.launch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debugger.Launch()</a> to attach Visual Studio to the external program. This will display a Just In Time prompt, asking me which instance of Visual Studio I would like to use. I find this to be much slower than \"Attach to Process\", but this way I am sure that the debugger is attached before any breakpoints can occur. Placing this between <code>#if DEBUG</code> and <code>#end if</code> makes sure this popup doesn't show when I create a release build, which helps too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Add as Existing Project</strong><br>\nI've added the executable of the program as a project to my solution. By doing this I can set this executable as startup project, and pressing F5 will start it. The biggest advantage of this, is that I can now debug the executable as soon at is it is started. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0bxe8ytt.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug an Executable Not Part of a Visual Studio Solution</a>. With this, Visual Studio breaks at exceptions, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to load the breakpoints. The following information is shown when I try using breakpoints:\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5itdQ.png\" alt=\"breakpoint\">\nThe modules window displays: \"Binary was not built with debug information.\". Can this be solved?</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Start Action</strong><br>\nSilentDoc noted that I can also set an external program as start action, using Properties -> Debug -> Start Action. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/68c8335t.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Change the Start Action for Application Debugging</a> It appears to load the breakpoints correctly this way. However, for some reason this makes the external program freeze for <strong>5 minutes</strong> at the first breakpoint/exception encountered. After it is done freezing, things seem to work as expected. What could cause this freeze?</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Image File Execution Options</strong><br>\nAs hmemcpy suggested, I can also use \"Image File Execution Options\" for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a329t4ed.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launching the Debugger Automatically</a>. This seems to be the same as Debugger.Launch(), since it displays the same Just In Time prompt. However, this Just In Time \"debugger\" doesn't debug at all: breakpoints and exceptions are ignored. Also, when working with a release build, I can't simply disable the Just In Time prompt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nOption 1 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but takes too much time.<br>\nOption 2 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but is too slow.<br>\nOption 3 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.<br>\nOption 4 loads breakpoints, but freezes for 5 minutes at first breakpoint/exception.<br>\nOption 5 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional information</strong><br>\nThe external program and class library are both written in VB.NET, I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, and the target framework is .NET Framework 4.0.  </p>\n\n<p>Option 1 and 2 work for me, but after a while, all those dialogs and prompts become annoying, and slow me down. Option 3 and 4 seem more suitable for me, so if anyone can tell me how to get them to work, that would be great. Option 5 doesn't seem that interesting either, I don't want to be using regedit.exe all the time. If there are any other options, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Ruud Lenders</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","debugging","debugview"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":129,"score":0,"question_id":12494300,"title":"No output from DebugView","body":"<p>I've installed DebugView 4.79 on Windows 7 and Windows 8 64 bit machines and a Windows 7 32 bit machine.

I have been able to reproduce the behavior in a smaller test app with more reliable triggering of the erratic behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I can definitely rule out both threading and (I think) memory issues. The new app uses no Tasks or other threading/asynchronous features, and I can trigger the unhandled exception simply by adding properties that return a constant to the class of objects shown in the DataGrid. This indicates to me that the problem is either in unmanaged resource exhaustion or something I haven't thought of yet.</p>\n\n<p>The revised program is structured like this. I have created a user control called <code>EntityCollectionGridView</code> which has a label and a data grid. In the control's Loaded event handler, I assign a <code>List&lt;TestClass&gt;</code> to the data grid with 1000 or 10000 rows, letting the grid generate the columns. This user control is instantiated 2-4 times in MainPage.xaml in the page's <code>OnNavigatedTo</code> event (or <code>Loaded</code>, it doesn't seem to matter). If an exception occurs, it occurs immediately after MainPage is shown.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is, the behavior doesn't seem to vary with the number of rows shown (it will work reliably with 10000 rows or fail reliably with only 1000 rows in each grid) but rather with the total number of columns in all the grids loaded at a given time. With 20 properties to show, 4 grids works fine. With 35 properties and 4 grids, the exception is thrown. But if I eliminate two grids, the same class with 35 properties will work fine.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of the properties I add to <code>TestClass</code> to jump from 20 to 35 columns are of the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public string StringXYZ { get { return \"asdfasdfasdfasdfasf\"; } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, there's no additional memory in the backing data (and again, I don't think memory pressure is the problem anyway).</p>\n\n<p>What do you all think? Again, the handles/user objects/etc in Task Manager look good, but is there something else I might be missing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original post</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have been working on a port of the Silverlight Toolkit DataGrid to WinRT, and it has done well enough in simple tests (a variety of configurations and up to 10000 rows). However, as I have tried to embed it into another WinRT app I have run into a sporadic exception (of type System.Exception, raised in the App.UnhandledException handler) that is proving very difficult to debug.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Not enough quota is available to process this command. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070718)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The error is consistently reproducible, but not deterministically. That is, I can make it happen every time I run the App, but it doesn't always happen by performing the same exact set of steps the same number of times. The error seems to occur on page transitions (whether navigating to a new page forward or back to a previous page), and not (for instance) when changing the ItemsSource of the datagrid.</p>\n\n<p>The application structure is basically recursive access through a hierarchy, with a page shown at each hierarchy level. On the page for the current node in the hierarchy, each child node and some grandchild nodes are shown, and for any subnode a datagrid may be shown. In practice, I consistently reproduce this with the following navigation structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Root page: shows no datagrid\n  Child page: shows one datagrid and a few listviews\n    Grandchild page: shows two datagrids, one bound to the\n                     same source as Child page, the other one empty\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A typical test scenario is, start at Root, move to Child, move to Grandchild, move back to Child, and then when I try to navigate to Grandchild again, it fails with the exception I mentioned above. But it might fail the first time I hit Grandchild, or it might let me move back and forth a few times before failing.</p>\n\n<p>The call stack has only one managed frame on it, which is the unhandled exception event handler. This is very unhelpful. Switching to mixed mode debugging, I get the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WinRTClient.exe!WinRTClient.App.InitializeComponent.AnonymousMethod__14(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e) Line 50 + 0x20 bytes  C#\n[Native to Managed Transition]  \nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::CFTMEventSource&lt;Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventHandler,Windows::UI::Xaml::IApplication,Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventArgs&gt;::Raise(Windows::UI::Xaml::IApplication * pSource, Windows::UI::Xaml::IUnhandledExceptionEventArgs * pArgs)  Line 327  C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::Application::RaiseUnhandledExceptionEventHelper(long hrEncountered, unsigned short * pszErrorMessage, unsigned int * pfIsHandled)  Line 920 + 0xa bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::ErrorHelper::CallAUHandler(unsigned int errorCode, unsigned int * pfIsHandled, wchar_t * * pbstrErrorMessage)  Line 39 + 0x14 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::ErrorHelper::ProcessUnhandledErrorForUserCode(long error)  Line 82 + 0x10 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!AgCoreCallbacks::CallAUHandler(unsigned int errorCode)  Line 1104 + 0x8 bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CCoreServices::ReportUnhandledError(long errorXR)  Line 6582    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::Tick()  Line 1126 + 0xb bytes   C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::OnReentrancyProtectedWindowMessage(HWND__ * hwnd, unsigned int msg, unsigned int wParam, long lParam)  Line 653 C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CXcpDispatcher::WindowProc(HWND__ * hwnd, unsigned int msg, unsigned int wParam, long lParam)  Line 401 + 0x24 bytes    C++\nuser32.dll!_InternalCallWinProc@20()  + 0x23 bytes  \nuser32.dll!_UserCallWinProcCheckWow@36()  + 0xbd bytes  \nuser32.dll!_DispatchMessageWorker@8()  + 0xf8 bytes \nuser32.dll!_DispatchMessageW@4()  + 0x10 bytes  \nWindows.UI.dll!Windows::UI::Core::CDispatcher::ProcessMessage(int bDrainQueue, int * pbAnyMessages)  Line 121   C++\nWindows.UI.dll!Windows::UI::Core::CDispatcher::ProcessEvents(Windows::UI::Core::CoreProcessEventsOption options)  Line 184 + 0x10 bytes C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CJupiterWindow::RunCoreWindowMessageLoop()  Line 416 + 0xb bytes    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!CJupiterControl::RunMessageLoop()  Line 714 + 0x5 bytes C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::DXamlCore::RunMessageLoop()  Line 2539 + 0x5 bytes    C++\nWindows.UI.Xaml.dll!DirectUI::FrameworkView::Run()  Line 91 C++\ntwinapi.dll!`Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationViewAgileContainer::RuntimeClassInitialize'::`55'::&lt;lambda_A2234BA2CCD64E2C&gt;::operator()(void * pv)  Line 560  C++\ntwinapi.dll!`Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationViewAgileContainer::RuntimeClassInitialize'::`55'::&lt;lambda_A2234BA2CCD64E2C&gt;::&lt;helper_func&gt;(void * pv)  Line 613 + 0xe bytes   C++\nSHCore.dll!_SHWaitForThreadWithWakeMask@12()  + 0xceab bytes    \nkernel32.dll!@BaseThreadInitThunk@12()  + 0xe bytes \nntdll.dll!___RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x27 bytes   \nntdll.dll!__RtlUserThreadStart@8()  + 0x1b bytes    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This indicates to me that whatever I'm doing wrong doesn't register until after at least one cycle in the app's message loop (and I also tried breaking on all thrown exceptions using \"Debug | Exceptions...\" -- as far as I can tell, nothing is thrown and swallowed). The interesting stack frames I see are <code>WindowProc</code>, <code>OnReentrancyProtectedWindowMessage</code>, and <code>Tick</code>. The <code>msg</code> is 0x402 (1026), which doesn't mean anything to me. <a href=\"http://wiki.winehq.org/List_Of_Windows_Messages\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> lists that message as used in the following contexts:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CBEM_SETIMAGELIST \nDDM_CLOSE \nDM_REPOSITION \nHKM_GETHOTKEY \nPBM_SETPOS \nRB_DELETEBAND \nSB_GETTEXTA \nTB_CHECKBUTTON \nTBM_GETRANGEMAX \nWM_PSD_MINMARGINRECT\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but that doesn't mean anything much to me, either (it might not even be relevant).</p>\n\n<p>The three theories I can come up with are these:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Memory pressure.</strong> But I have run into this with 24% of my physical memory free and the app consuming less than 100MB of memory. Other times, the app won't have hit any problems navigating around a while and racking up 400MB of memory</li>\n<li><strong>Threading problems,</strong> such as access to the UI thread from a worker thread. And, in fact, I do have data access happening on a background thread. But this is using a (ported) framework that has been very reliable in a WinForms environment and in an Outlook plugin, and I think the thread use is safe. Additionally, I can use the same data in this app without any problems binding just to ListViews and so forth. Finally, the Grandchild node is configured such that selecting a row in the first datagrid kicks off a request for the row's detail items, which are displayed in the second datagrid (which is initially empty, and can remain so without preventing the exception). This happens without a page transition and works flawlessly for as long as I choose to fiddle with the selection. But navigating back to Child might kill me right away, even though there should be no data access at that point and therefore not threading operations that I know of.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource exhaustion</strong> of some kind, maybe GUI handles. But I don't think I'm putting that much pressure on this system. In one execution, breaking in the exception handler, Task Manager reports the process using 662 handles, 21 User objects, and 12 GDI objects, as compared to Tweetro which is using 734, 37, and 19 respectively without problems. What else might I be missing in this category?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have plenty of disk space free, and am not using the disk for anything other than configuration files anyway (and all that worked fine before adding the datagrids).</p>\n\n<p>My next thought was to try to step through some of the potential 'interesting' parts of the datagrid code and jump over any that were questionable. I did try that with the datagrid's ArrangeOverride, but the exception didn't seem to care whether I did that or not. Also, I am not sure this is a useful strategy. Since the exception isn't being thrown until after a cycle on the message loop, and since I can't know for sure when it's about to happen, I would need to cover a huge number of permutations, running each permutation a whole lot of times, to isolate the problem code.</p>\n\n<p>The error is thrown in both Debug and Release modes. And, as a final background note, the amount of data we're dealing with here is small, much smaller than my 10000-row runs of the datagrid in isolation. It's probably on the order of 50-100 rows, with perhaps 30-40 columns.

From my accounts_model.php:</p>\n\n<pre><code> public function getData()  \n {\n     //Query the data table for every record and row\n     $query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;get('accounts');\n\n     if ($query-&gt;num_rows() &gt; 0)\n     {\n         show_error('Database is empty!');\n     }\n     else\n     {\n         return $query-&gt;result();\n     }\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run the application, I see \"An Error was Encountered\\nDatabase is empty!\".  Since I know the database is not empty and configuration is correct, I need something from the framework to give me a hint whether it is connecting to the database or why the query is empty.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","debugging"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":2,"question_id":12499001,"title":"Xcode DEBUG Mode - when is it on/off?","body":"<p>I have noticed that this works in dev mode (testing on the simulator, etc):</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG\n    //do stuff\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But when I archive and distribute test builds, the app does not act in DEBUG mode even though I'm still building with the developer profile.

However, I'm skeptical that this will work without prompting the user about whether they want to break into the debugger.</p>\n\n<p>Before doing more thorough tests of this approach, I wanted to check whether anyone has definitive information about whether this is likely to work and/or can suggest an alternative approach that will enable a function written in C++ to get a stack trace from the scripting engine that invoked it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","debugging","firebug","javascript-debugger"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":2,"question_id":12478141,"title":"View Javascript calls as they happen?","body":"<p>I've inherited a pretty large project and I'm trying to track down an annoying bug, but for the life of me I can't find where this specific action is getting called and executed.

I have been enjoying the built in javascript debugger in IE8 for several months. About 2 weeks ago, I installed some security update for IE 8 (possibly KB978207) and all of a sudden the javascript debugger is now broken. </p>\n\n<p>If I get a warning from IE 8 that an error occurred and asking if I want to debug using the built in debugger, if I hit yes, I get a grey popup in the top left corner (which I've never seen before) saying \"JScript Debugger. Breaking on JScript runtime error - Object doesn't support this property or method\". Then nothing happens. IE freezes up and then I get a Windows popup saying that IE 8 is no longer responding and asking if I want to end this process. If I try to end the process, nothing happens and I continue to get the grey popup. I usually have to kill debugging process from VS 2005, but the frozen IE8 still is present. It's not until later when the OS, finally cleans up the process that it will go away...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit (new info):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I tried removing the lastest security update and a silverlight update that came around the same time, but Windows automatically reinstalled them....</p>\n\n<p>I then tried removing IE 8, and then adding it back to my system to reset anything related to IE8. This did not have any effect. </p>\n\n<p>After reinstalling IE8, I did notice that, when I first tried to open the developer tools window by hitting F12 from a regular IE 8 window, I never saw anything, but I could see the developer tools title in the task manager list. I had to right click on the task and maximize the window, so I could actually see the developer tools window. Apparently this is a bug mentioned here: <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/79b8ee54-c5f6-4467-ba6d-27491c95cd13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/79b8ee54-c5f6-4467-ba6d-27491c95cd13</a></p>\n\n<p>I've realized that the window will maximize if the iexplorer.exe process is not the debugged process launched from VS2005. </p>\n\n<p>The grey popup I mentioned in my original post is from the developer tools window iexplorer.exe process.</p>\n\n<p>If I launch my app from VS2005 and then hit F12, I see that the developer tools window is opened (I can see that window is opened under the IE icon in my taskbar), but it is not shown. If I try to maximize it from the task manager, this has no effect. </p>\n\n<p>So basically, the developer tools window is freezing up when it tries to open under my debugged iexplorer.exe process launched from VS2005. The OS then asks if I want to kill the process since it's not responding, but it is unable to kill it. At some later point, the zombie iexplorer.exe process is killed succesfully (by the OS I presume).</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","visual-studio","debugging"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":14,"up_vote_count":33,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8601,"score":33,"question_id":75180,"title":"How to display a dynamically allocated array in the Visual Studio debugger?","body":"<p>If you have a statically allocated array, the Visual Studio debugger can easily display all of the array elements.

I need a UART, and so I used the TI's sample code \"msp430x20x3_ta_uart2400.c\" to emulate one using the Timer module. This all worked fine (compiled with IAR Embedded Workbench), having tested it using PuTTY to transmit characters to a development board and a loopback to echo them to the terminal.</p>\n\n<p>That was a de-risking exercise, and now I've come to port that code into my application's state machine. Having done this, I'm having issues surrounding the timer interrupts and low power sleep modes. Here's the snippet of my code around the entry into the low power (sleep) mode:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>// Prepare the UART to receive one byte.\nprepare_receiver();\n\n// Enter low power mode 1.\n__bis_SR_register(LPM1_bits + GIE);\n\n// Check whether the full message has been received.\nif(true == get_message_complete())\n{\n    process_event(e_euart_message_received, NULL);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I'm seeing on the debugger (C-Spy) is that sometimes it will execute the <code>bis_SR_register()</code> line on first entry and then go to the <code>if</code> statement, i.e., ignoring the fact that I've asked it to go to sleep. On other occasions, when it does go to sleep when it should, the ISR triggers correctly and eventually brings me back to the <code>if</code> statement to continue program execution (as I'm expecting). However, if I try to step to the next statement, the application freezes on that first line, i.e., I can't advance.</p>\n\n<p>I can't think of anything functionally different from TI's example that I'm doing, so I figure my problem must be something to do with how I've ported it. For example, my Timer ISR and the code I've posted here are in different compilation units - would this sort of decision have any bearing on things? I'm aware my question might be a little vague but unfortunately I can't post all of my code, so instead I'm looking for someone with MSP experience who might be able to suggest some things to look at or some potential pitfalls that I may have fallen into.</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","erlang","otp"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":114,"score":0,"question_id":12436509,"title":"Erlang dbg – Debugging on production OTP system with remote shell","body":"<p>I have an OTP based Erlang application that seems to behave weird.</p>\n\n<p>I want to connect to the erlang shell and trace exactly what is happening.\nI can do all my calls to dbg:tracer(), dbg:tp() etc. just fine, however no output is sent to my shell.</p>\n\n<p>I think this might be, because I am connecting via a remote shell.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I call dbg:n(wiwob@vlxd38-wob).

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>\n\n<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's the rub:<br>\nWhen it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>\n<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>\n\n<p>A colleague just walked past and asked \"Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?\"</p>\n\n<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>\n\n<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.

I have combined the other posts here and throughout the web and tried all the suggestions (Add debuggable:\"true\" to the manifest, stop and start adb, Clean all, make sure I use the debug button not the run button, etc etc).  In the Debug perspective I can see the threads and in DDMS it shows the debug icon next to the device I am debugging on.  I do see the blue dots where I set the breakpoint and the Debug perspective lists them and says they are active.</p>\n\n<p>I have put in alerts just before the breakpoints to verify the code is getting executed.</p>\n\n<p>Starting to go crazy here.  Any other suggestions?  I must be missing something simple but non-obvious.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:  I appreciate the responses so far. Unfortunately they have not solved my problem.  I have followed the instruction on debugging and have debugging turned on in the phone.  Also, I do see the \"Waiting for debugger\" alert on the phone when starting.  In general everything says I am debugging (including getting logcat output that I have added).  It just will not stop on breakpoints that I have added and are listed in the breakpoints tab in the Debug perspective.  Also just to reiterate - this happens when debugging on the device as well as on the emulator.  One thing I do notice is that when I launch the debugger I have it set to bring up the Android Device Chooser.  In there the \"debug\" column is blank for my device - but if the emulator is running the debug column does say 'Yes'.  Also the console states that is attempting to connect to the debugger.  Should there be a console log that states that the debugger successfully connected?  I do not see this.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 20120914: I have been away from this for some time and had given up previously.  Back to try and tackle this.  It is still not resolved.  Everything above is still current - but one other thing I have noticed. I set a Class Load Breakpoint on the main activity and it does stop there.  It just does not stop at any Line Breakpoints.  I have just updated to the latest JDK 1.7.0_07, Android SDK 20, ADT Plugin 20.0.3. I have used the logcat to output a message and set a breakpoint on this line.  I see the message in logcat so I know the code is being executed.  The debug window in the debig perspective also does show the android application with a number of threads beneath it and the Devices window in the DDMS perspective shows the application with the green bug icon next to it.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing - when the debugger is running the line breakpoints bullets do not get a checkmark overlaid on them (the Class Load Breakpoint does!).  I am guessing this is the root cause - but I don't know why they are not getting this. (By the way skip breakoints is also not set - breakpoints do not have lines through them).</p>\n\n<p>Any new suggestions would be appreciated.  I have burned a lot of time on this.  It must be something obvious that I am not seeing.</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","webstorm"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1211,"score":1,"question_id":7477964,"title":"Webstorm debugging?","body":"<p>I recently installed Webstorm for my html5 / css / javascript project.

I've reproduced the problem on several developers' workstations.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>I set a breakpoint in <code>IdeasController.cs</code> in our Web API:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WDd8r.png\" alt=\"Breakpoint set in code\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another file called <code>IdeasController.cs</code> exists in our separate MVC 4 web project.

I was messing around with an app on my device, ran it in Debug mode, and it unexpectedly terminated.  I realized I had caused a NullPointerException and the problem itself was not an issue for very long.</p>\n\n<p>What is an issue, however, is that the debugger seems unable to identify where in my code the exception was thrown.  The stack trace does not reference my code.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, if I put the following in the <code>OnCreate()</code> method, I get the same problem</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.main);\n\n    //lI(\"onCreate()\");  //A silly logging thing I messed around with\n\n    Integer iDareYou = null;\n    iDareYou.byteValue();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Much to its credit, Eclipse certainly warns me that the code is likely to blow up in my face.  But when I actually run this on my device, the stack trace returned is the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread [&lt;1&gt; main] (Suspended (exception RuntimeException))  \nActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 2787  \nActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 2803   \nActivityThread.access$2300(ActivityThread, ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 135 \nActivityThread$H.handleMessage(Message) line: 2136  \nActivityThread$H(Handler).dispatchMessage(Message) line: 99 \nLooper.loop() line: 144 \nActivityThread.main(String[]) line: 4937    \nMethod.invokeNative(Object, Object[], Class, Class[], Class, int, boolean) line: not available [native method]  \nMethod.invoke(Object, Object...) line: 521  \nZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run() line: 868  \nZygoteInit.main(String[]) line: 626 \nNativeStart.main(String[]) line: not available [native method]  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I searched around for some answers and unfortunately all I could come up with were questions of the 'Why is my Android app causing a NullPointerException'? variety.</p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping to find out what I should be doing differently in order to be able to find the point in my code where I caused the exception.... because I'm sure this ability would come in handy at some point in the future!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Going to edit this to add some information.  As the first comment below mentions, the state in which the debugger suspends the thread is not the 'final' state of the application.  Pressing 'resume' a couple times moves the process along to the point where the process actually terminates, although unfortunately no helpful stack trace is displayed in the Eclipse/ADT Debug window.  <em>However</em>, at this point the stack trace I pasted above <em>Followed By</em> the first 3 unique lines of the stack trace of the NPE in my code is output to LogCat.  I had previously looked to see if LogCat had anything I could use, but most likely it was before I had pressed 'resume' in the debugger to move the process to this state.  Unfortunately though, doing it this way never displays a stack trace of the NPE in my code in the actual debugger.</p>\n\n<p>But the news isnt all bad - from the information in the 'Variables' window on the right, I can see that there is an NPE in the thread's current scope, so that would at least give me a clue that an NPE is going on (and of course there is LogCat).</p>\n\n<p>So based on a suggestion in a different topic, the best work around I've found is to add a \"Caught and Uncaught\" breakpoint for NullPointerException.  When I do this and relaunch, the debugger displays the stack trace of the NPE in my code, and moves the edit window straight to the line where I caused the NPE.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment I believe this is because the NPE is being caught (and presumably, thrown again) by the Android framework.  <strong>It appears the original dilemma was caused by the fact that the Eclipse/ADT/DalvikVM Debug Stack Trace window does not include the 'caused by' information (as far as I can tell) that is displayed in the stack trace \"later\" appearing in LogCat</strong>.  I will investigate further as to whether this can be remedied :)</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate Bert F's suggestion, as I was not fully aware that the thread was not yet in its 'final' state.  While it is true that the stack trace is [later] displayed in LogCat, I did not 'miss' it in LogCat because it was not [yet] there, what I did miss was hitting 'resume' which would have caused the stack trace to be output in LogCat.  </p>\n\n<p>Even though I originally got the debugger to stop at the line in my code using a breakpoint, there is a case for the fact that I could have ultimately obtained the stack trace in LogCat after resuming the thread, which would have effectively solved the problem.  The only other thing I could really ask for would be to have the debugger stop at the line in my code causing the exception, instead of it being caught and later re-thrown by the Android framework.  But I believe that would be a different question :)  And Eclipse, being useful as it is, will send me there if I click on the appropriate line in the stack trace displayed in the LogCat window.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","visual-studio","debugging","heisenbug"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1261,"score":2,"question_id":4532457,"title":"Program and debugger quit without indication of problem","body":"<p>OK, not quite a Heisenbug but similar in nature.</p>\n\n<p>I'm developing a WPF application.

My code (see snippet below) runs perfectly fine on the PIC24HJ256GP610 [note: not 610A]. I'm using the I2C bus for communicating with a DS1374 RTCC. But on the 610A, it gets stuck when polling the ACKSTAT bit when trying to write a value to the RTCC with I2C. Also, most of the time the RTCC value does not increment when reading the value via I2C (sometimes it does increment as it should). Any ideas? Is there a config bit/mode/setting difference between the 610 and 610A that deals with the I2C module? I've tried switching out the RTCC chip, and switching out processors. So, the only difference here is that the I2C communication works on the 610, and not on the 610A.</p>\n\n<p>What are the differences between the 610 and 610A? Is the 610 an obsolete part that is no longer manufactured, or will it keep being manufactured?</p>\n\n<p>A few things I've noticed when experimenting, probing the signals, and stepping through with the debugger:</p>\n\n<p>1). The I2C clock goes high indefinitely on the to-be 20th transmitted bit, which is where it gets stuck polling the ACKSTAT bit if I pause the debugger. The first bit appears to be the start bit, then 9 more bits, then another start/stop bit, then 9 more bits, then the clock line goes high.</p>\n\n<p>2). When the clock line gets stuck and using the watch window, the value in the I2C1STATbits register is 0x8008, which translates to received a NACK from the slave device, and that a Start (or Repeated Start) bit has been detected last.</p>\n\n<p>3). I am always able to read from the slave device (RTCC) with both 610 and 610A. However, sometimes with the 610A its value does not increment and stays at some integer value. I believe when I cut off power to everything and reprogram everything, the RTCC value changes. Sometimes it stays constant when reading the value, and maybe 25% of the time it actually changes as it should when reading its value.</p>\n\n<p>4). I am not able to write anything to the RTCC via I2C using the 610A. The processor gets stuck polling the ACKSTAT bit (I assume because it received a NACK from the RTCC.)

My language is here - <a href=\"https://github.com/bryanedds/aml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bryanedds/aml</a> .</p>\n\n<p>I am likely going to compile it down to IL. If it's helpful for writing the debugger, I'll write the compiler first. However, I am wondering what are some approaches for building the debugger. I looked at building it for Visual Studio, but that's difficult as it seems to require me to interface with VS via COM, meaning I need to write the debugger in C or C++ (UGH!). I'm hoping that Visual Studio Debugger development has a better story that I'm not aware of.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at other threads on .NET debugging on SO, I see that IL includes source file coordinates, so I wonder if that means that I don't need to write as much COM code as one would initially suspect (EG - step debugging works out of the box without any COM code so long as the compiled IL has source file coordinates).</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, I could look at using another IDE that maybe has a happier path for .NET language debugging. There is Eclipse, but it doesn't seem to have any particular support for .NET language debugging.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the IDE with the best debugger building story might be MonoDevelop. Of course, I'd need it to work with MS .NET instead of just Mono. However, it's documentation is rather bare. Anyone have experience building a debugger there?</p>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, I'm rather lost in all this. I just need some ways to build a simple debugger with breakpoints and step debugging with variable inspection for my .NET language. I'd prefer to write most of the code in F# as that's what my language is written in.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","debugging","cuda","gpu","nsight"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":860,"score":1,"question_id":10153668,"title":"How to debug CUDA kernels in Visual studio or Parallel Nsight","body":"<p>I have CUDA 4.1 SDK with Parallel Nsight 2.1 installed on Win7 x64.

In visual studio 2008 you get an \"uninitialized local variable used\" warning at compile-time and get a run-time check failure at the point of access when debugging.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you access an uninitialized struct's member variable through one of its functions, you don't get any warnings or assertions.  Obviously the easiest solution is <em>don't do that</em>, but nobody's perfect.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct Test\n{\n    float GetMember() const { return member; }\n    float member;\n};\nTest test;\nfloat f1 = test.member;      // Raises warning, asserts in VS debugger at runtime\nfloat f2 = test.GetMember(); // No problem, just keeps on going\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This surprised me, but it makes some sense -- the compiler can't assume calling a function on an unused struct is an error, or how else would you initialize or construct it?  And anything fancier just quickly brings up so many other complications that it makes sense that it wouldn't bother classifying which functions are ok to call and when, especially just as a debugging help.  I know I can set up my own assertions or error checking within the class itself, but that can complicate some simpler structs.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it would seem like within the context of the function call, wouldn't it know insides <code>GetMember()</code> that <code>member</code> wasn't initialized yet?  I'm assuming it's not only relying on static compile-time deduction, given the <code>Run-Time Check Failure #3</code> it raises during execution, so based on my current understanding of it it would seem reasonable for the same checks to apply.

These threads have ZERO interaction with each other, Ala the first thread runs without messing with the second thread. There is no Synchronization between them, as there is no need for that to be happening.

The second Thread is more involved and runs through its coding constantly until shutdown by the user by exiting the application. </p>\n\n<p>The Second Thread first reads from memory and stores the data into a List, then uses this data to make some calculations. I have a StopWatch class timer to measure the time it takes to complete one iteration of the Second Thread. This timer is reset and started at the very beginning of the thread and then stopped and printed to console once the thread has completed an iteration. This is where I have been getting my performance data. I have been allowing the Thread to run for at least 1000 iterations and then doing an average excluding the first run. </p>\n\n<p>The DEBUG version of the build, that is the build that is run by the VSHOST or when one would hit F5 in Visual Studio C# 2010 Express.

However, when I compile this as a Release project, x gains the value of 0x0000000000000000.</p>\n\n<p>Also, when tracing through this in the MSVS debugger (still in release mode), a few interesting things happen:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The constructor for Baz is in fact called, and \"this\" has a valid memory location inside of Baz's constructor.</li>\n<li>After returning from the constructor (back in Foo::Bar()), the value of this (presumably \"Foo\") is now THE SAME as the value of \"this\" inside of Baz's constructor (presumely \"Baz\").</li>\n<li>None of Foo's data appears to have been lost, even though it just apparently changed memory addresses.</li>\n<li>\"This\" (as Foo) somehow magically grows a new data member of type MyNamespace::Baz, that contains all of the correct data that was assigned during the constructor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So apparently compiler optimization is making something extremely mystical occur.  Again, this only seems to occur in Release mode, which makes me think that A) the optimizer is making a difference, and B) makes it difficult for me to get further information on what is actually happening.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone seen this before? What is happening here??  How can I get my next function to stop segfaulting because X is null???</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  MSVS is lying to me, and continues to lie to me to this day.  Luckily, dumping in QMessageBoxes works like a charm (no idea where cout is going, but it's not the console.  Oy...)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","debugging","jnlp","webstart"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":1,"question_id":12305706,"title":"Debugging JNLP Application","body":"<p>I want to debug a JNLP application.

A colleague of mine is trying to overwrite the session handling of a framework that we use. This framework uses PHP's own native session handling by default, but he is now trying to implement a database layer between the requests.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is that the database object is not available by the time sessions are written anymore, yet it is available for other functions such as when data is read from sessions. This is a wild behavior. Here's what we did:</p>\n\n<pre><code>register_shutdown_function('exithandler'); \n\nsession_set_save_handler(\n    'sess_open',\n    'sess_close',\n    'sess_read',\n    'sess_write',\n    'sess_destroy',\n    'sess_gc'\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each of those functions also writes a single line to our log file that we can track with the name of the function.

In the application multiple windows with the ActiveX comp. can be open at any time - these can either show the same graphics (different zoom factor etc), or different graphics. </p>\n\n<p>The application is for positioning, and the ActiveX is drawing and showing positions of different units. </p>\n\n<p>Around 10 times a second the Borland application got a new position, and finds out which forms (and their ActiveX) needs to know about the updated position in order to draw it. This have been going well for a long time, but I have had to do quite some changes in the ActiveX for a new version of the product.</p>\n\n<p>About a year ago I had to do some minor changes in the component aswell, and I found that the application could end in a state, causing an \"index out of bounds\" error in the component. The result of this was not an error getting shown or the program terminating, but instead the application started to use a huge amount of memory - and kept going up very fast. At some point it stopped and the component that had the error simply stopped showing anything (stopped drawing itself).</p>\n\n<p>Now with the recent changes I have made, I have the same problem where one of the components seems to get an error, which is not getting shown, and instead it is not redrawing itself, and the memory use is going sky-high. On some PC's it seems that an Access Violation is thrown - which is saying that the error happened in the OCX, but on the PC I develop on, I cant get this Access Violation in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Also I cannot track down exactly when the error happens - ie what is causing the error.

I enqueued my scripts with the following function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function my_scripts(){\n    wp_deregister_script('jquery');\n    wp_register_script('jquery', 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js',null,null,true);\n    wp_register_script('cycle', 'http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery.cycle/2.88/jquery.cycle.all.js',null,null,true);\n    wp_register_script('plugin', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/scripts/plugin-init.js',null,null,true);\n    wp_enqueue_script('jquery');\n    wp_enqueue_script('cycle');\n    wp_enqueue_script('plugin');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First the <code>jquery</code> and the <code>cycle</code> scripts are both being pulled from CDNs. The <code>plugin</code> script is empty with the exception of a basic <code>cycle</code> call on a single element.</p>\n\n<p>At this point all browsers worked fine with the exception of IE9. I received the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code> SCRIPT5: Access is denied\n jquery.min.js, line 2 character 68522 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I found out quickly enough that this was a cross origin issue:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5087549/access-denied-to-jquery-script-on-ie\">Access denied to jQuery script on IE</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5793831/script5-access-is-denied-in-ie9-on-xmlhttprequest\">SCRIPT5: Access is denied in IE9 on xmlhttprequest</a></p>\n\n<p>I found this odd since there were no cross origin functions in my plugins. Also the issue was showing up on <code>jquery</code> itself and not my code. Tried several suggested fixes but had no luck.</p>\n\n<p>Tried some basic stuff. Moved the script directly into the footer. Tried moving it directly into the header. Tried cutting my scripts out of the equation. Pulling my hair out at this point.</p>\n\n<p>My best bet was going to be to actually see what was causing the error in the code (since I couldn't on the minified version). At this point the code was directly in the header so removed the <code>.min</code> from the script, did a refresh, and TA-DA: Everything is now working without a hitch. </p>\n\n<p>If I try to move the unminified script declaration back to the <code>my_scripts()</code> function using <code>wp_register_script</code> &amp; <code>wp_enqueue_script</code> it will fail again. If I try to move the unminified script declaration into the footer it will fail again. I did not test a local copy at the time, only the CDN versions. </p>\n\n<p>It's the same SCRIPT5 error but I unfortunately don't have the code the error is generating from handy. This was at the office the other day and I'm off for the weekend. I attempted to reproduce the events on my personal sandbox but was unsuccessful in recreating the error, which leads me to believe something unlisted may be the culprit.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any idea what's going on here? Why would <code>jquery.min</code> fail where the unminified file would not? And why would the unminified file continue to fail unless its directly in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>?  </p>\n\n<p>Happy to supply more information, although some of it may have to wait until I return to work this coming week.

Where it tells me to select a condition, I choose <strong>All Items</strong>, then I click <strong>Add to List</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5b. Where it now tells me to select an action, I choose <strong>Execute Script</strong>, then I click <strong>Set Values and Add</strong>, which allows me to choose the script called <strong>new-create-folders.js</strong> which I had previously added to the <strong>Scripts</strong> folder within the <strong>Data Dictionary</strong>. Then I click <strong>OK</strong>, and then <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5c. Here where it asks me for the <strong>type</strong>, I choose <strong>Items are updated</strong>. I then enter a title like <strong>create folders rule</strong>. And finally I check <strong>Run rule in the background</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>.\n<br><br>5d. Now I click <strong>Finish</strong> to finalize my rule.</li>\n<li>Now with the rule created, I click <strong>Create</strong>, <strong>Create Content</strong>.\n<br><br>6a. I give my content a name like <strong>name001</strong>, then I hit <strong>Next</strong>, then I enter a title like <strong>title001</strong> and an author like <strong>author001</strong>. Then I hit <strong>OK</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What happens now has got me confused; it creates one sub folder called <strong>title001</strong> like I wanted it to, and within that sub-folder it creates another folder called <strong>author001</strong>, and within that folder the file called <strong>name001</strong> has been moved. And that is sort of how I want it to work, but there are still problems. Under the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, there is also a new sub-folder called <strong>New Title 1346102873.393  New Title 1346102873.393</strong> with a folder inside of that called <strong>New Author 1346102873.393</strong>, but there is no file inside of that folder. And I don't know why this folder is created when I only added one piece of content to the <strong>mainFolder</strong>? Also, now that the folders have been created, the rule also looks to have been deleted from the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, i.e. there are no longer any rules applied to the folder. And when I go back to create the rule again on the <strong>mainFolder</strong>, I get the error: <code>Failed to create Rule due to error: null</code>. And below are the errors I get in the log files...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Output/Errors from Alfresco Log</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>17:27:51,373 DEBUG [org.alfresco.repo.jscript.RhinoScriptProcessor]

I filter on two things: category and description (via a contains/like regular expression). If I search based on category, all of the records in that category comes back (including the problem record), but if I throw in description, I cannot get that record to come back. Other records that match the description text come back, but for some reason, no matter what I put in, I can't get this one record to come back with a description condition.

Others with the word \"ceramic\" in their description do, but not that one, and of course the structure of that item is no different from the other items. It really should be passing the match.</p>\n\n<p>The casing is correct (\"ceramic\" is all lowers in both the description and the filter), and I've also tried /i to make the search case-insensitive.</p>\n\n<p>So how can I find out why this query is failing to produce an item that very clearly matches it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["debugging","tcp","udp","tcp-ip"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12202726,"title":"Track TCP/UDP Connections for a Program","body":"<p>What is the best way to track a application's internet communication?
