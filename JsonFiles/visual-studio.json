I have always had a single lime of development.  However I get into the usual trouble when releasing and starting the next version - dealing with bugs.  So this time I decided to use branching (forking or whatever is the best name).  I am a lone developer so I am the only one working with the repositiory.  My scenerio is simple.

I would then use Push or pull to get the bug fixes from the release copy into the beta copy (I think).</p>\n\n<p>I assume there must be another way however without cloning.  How would I do that?

All of those references have Copy Local set to 'True'.  Note that the code in the plugin assemblies (which are project references) is not referred to in \"ProjA\" directly, but is loaded and located through DI/Ninject.  (So I'm using these project references as a way of getting the plugin assemblies into the output folder, see below for why)</p>\n\n<p>I also have project \"ProjB\", which references ProjA.

I then think that adding the plugin assemblies as 'Content' to the project would work, but then I have two issues: 1) TFS source control; the plugin projects need a writable target to build to, presumably - content files would be 'checked in' and 2) some of the plugins have Content of their own: with references I don't need to worry about missing something.  Going the Content route I need to refer to another project's build output folder, include all of it's content, but not the PDBs.. seems even more hacky!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have also considered and played with post-build steps for either the plugin projects (not ideal: I am pulling them into this new solution from another, if I add post-build steps it will likely screw up the other solution) or the project which depends on them (which is OK, but an XCopy with relative paths, and having to manually set up Project Dependencies.. seems more hacky again).</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I'm missing, any ideas at all?

Certainly I understand the implications on the size of the class/struct in terms of padding. I believe that I understand that it is also better aligned because of the way that CPU instructions work and expect data. </p>\n\n<p>I have been looking at many different resources generally, for example (interesting)\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2006504/c-data-alignment-member-order-inheritance\">c++ data alignment /member order &amp; inheritance</a>\n(and other links like wikipedia) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment</a></p>\n\n<p>One area that can be affected (I read) seems to be performance, due to the need for data to be specific sizes for registers, misaligned data can cause issues (see wikipedia).</p>\n\n<p>I wrote some code in which I created 3 structs, all with the same members with packing set to 1 , normal alignment, and with the members rearranged. This gave me objects with sizeof 8, 10 and 12. I ran code similar to the following for each :</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct MixedData1\n{\n    char Data1;\n    short Data2;\n    int Data3;\n    char Data4;\n\n    void operator() (MixedData1&amp; md)\n    {\n        md.Data1 = 'a';\n        md.Data2 = 1024;\n        md.Data3 = 1000000;\n        md.Data4 = 'b';\n    }\n};\n\ntypedef std::vector&lt;MixedData1&gt; MDVector;\n\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    MixedData1 md;\n    for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10 ; count++)\n    {    \n        {\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(md) &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n        boost::timer::auto_cpu_timer t;\n        MDVector mdv(10000000); \n        std::fill(mdv.begin(),mdv.end(),md );\n        std::for_each(mdv.begin(),mdv.end(),md);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not really interested in the values so each element in the vector is initialised the same. Anyway I got results that indicated that the running time increased with the size of the struct - I.E with pack(1) (8 bytes) I got the quickest 0.08s, and with normal alignment (12 bytes) I got the slowest 0.105 . </p>\n\n<p>My questions are about the effects of being wrongly aligned. I don't think I have ever had any issues with alignment throughout my <em>X</em> years as a C++ programmer, but of course it could have just passed me by. </p>\n\n<p>(1) The alignment had an effect (I believe) in my test (edit) <strong>however as Neil posted it was only due to the difference in struct size</strong>. I tried accessing the member as per his reply but I saw no real effect there.... is there a clearer example? Is there a way I can see a dramatic effect of misalignment?\n(2) Is there a way to induce a crash caused by misalignment if possible. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","visual-studio","control","design-time"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13198510,"title":"Shared data for component property at design time","body":"<p>I have a component which implements an <code>IExtenderProvider</code>.

Can anyone suggest me a way to use it with my OpenGL Application?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","visual-studio","visual-studio-2012","sql-server-2012"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":13222445,"title":"Error when trying to connect to SQL Server 2012 from Visual Studio 2012","body":"<p>The tools used:\nVisual Studio 2012, MS SQL Server 2012, and VB.NET MVC 4</p>\n\n<p>Here is a showcase of how I attempt to establish a connection to the server and create a database.</p>\n\n<p>In this example MS SQL Server Compact 4.0 is used:</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1</h2>\n\n<p>Do <code>add the server</code>. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>Windows username</code> is used.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RjvFr.png\" alt=\"Connecting to the MS SQL Server 2012\"></p>\n\n<h2>Step 2</h2>\n\n<p>Do add the <code>database connection</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, do <code>test the connection</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/N7Adf.png\" alt=\"Connecting to the MS SQL Server 2012\"></p>\n\n<h2>Step 3</h2>\n\n<p>Do <code>create a table</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EELhq.png\" alt=\"Connecting to the MS SQL Server 2012\"></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>As a Notice, This Question Has Been Rewritten</h2>\n\n<p>I have managed the connection to the MS SQL Sever Compact 4.0, successfully.

What should I do in c++ to make new data appear in the file which is opened by application2?</p>\n\n<p>C++ side:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int realTimeValues  // this variable is updated continuously\n\nFILE * pFileTXT; \n\nwhile(1)\n{\n pFileTXT = fopen (\"realTimeData.txt\",\"a\"); // Opening file in append mode\n fprintf (pFileTXT, \"%d\\n\",realTimeValues);   // saving values to file\n fclose (pFileTXT)                            // Closing the file\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the application2 side I can't tell how exactly its opening this file. The application is Universal Real-Time Software Oscilloscope. In the menu there is an option \"read from a file\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","visual-studio-2012","visual-studio-debugging","intellitrace"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":2,"question_id":13189625,"title":"Visual Studio 2012 crashes everytime I try to debug with error CLR20r3","body":"<p>Everytime I try to debug one of my apps I get the below error message.

Everything is working as expected.</p>\n\n<p>The only restriction with this setup is that I can't define widgets or helper using   <code>Q_OBJECT</code> in <em>.cpp</em> files. This would be very convenient for small, context-specific helpers classes that should appear right next to where they're used.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to pass the whole list of source files (both <em>.h</em> and <em>.cpp</em>) to <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code>, instead of just the header files, but that doesn't work (linking fails because some moc-related symbols are undefined).</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem is that, for a given pair of files <em>foo.h</em> and <em>foo.cpp</em>, the <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code> macro will generate the same moc file (<em>moc_foo.cxx</em>) in the same directory, and obviously that means the first file will be overwritten by the second one, and as a result symbols will be missing at link-time.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to fix or work around that problem? For instance, I tried to add a specific rule for <em>foo.cpp</em> of the form</p>\n\n<pre><code>QT4_GENERATE_MOC(directory/foo.cpp directory/foo.moc)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then add</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"foo.moc\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>at the end of <em>foo.cpp</em>. I think this ought to work, but alas Visual Studio only allows one build rule per file, and <em>.cpp</em> files already have a build rule (compilation to object file), so this approach doesn't work, at least with Visual Studio.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that I had was to create a new macro, say <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP_WITH_PREFIX</code>, based on <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code> (which is defined in <em>share/cmake-2.8/Modules/Qt4Macros.cmake</em>), that would take an additional prefix argument and would add this prefix to the generated moc files. That way, I would call <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP_WITH_PREFIX</code> twice, once for <em>.h</em> files and once for <em>.cpp</em> files, with different prefixes. What I just dislike about this approach is that I'd be messing with the internals of CMake's Qt support, instead of using the public API.</p>\n\n<p>Any better idea?</p>\n\n<p>Cheerz, Franz</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio","events","usercontrols"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":1,"question_id":13138753,"title":"Using an event only in Designer View before run time in Visual Studio","body":"<p>I guess this is a really odd and rare question!! </p>\n\n<p>I've made a certain Label control that inherits the <code>System.Windows.Forms.Label</code> object and thus becomes visible and usable in the designer view.

So, maybe someone knows of a visual studio addin that can change how 'tab' key work so it will insert tab characters and space characters according to rules mentioned above? Any hints are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Update: I need it for C++.

This would be quite probable because when you create the report, you select your database tables and fields over an ODBC link and it saves the connection information into the report I think :S</p>\n\n<p>So, after much scouring on the net, I found a way to avoid this error, but again, I do not believe it's reading the Web.config connectionString but rather the embedded connection in the .rpt file.</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            crystalReportSource.ReportDocument.SetDatabaseLogon(\"user\", \"real_pass\");\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works to circumvent the continuous prompt.

I'm new to MEF development and am not sure what I'm doing wrong, is there something extra I need to consider since I'm working with an MVC application?  Why won't the Project 1 extensions list get filled?  Are my interface definitions wrong?  The sample calculator application is a simple command line project and that seems to work fine, the only difference I see is that the external DLL project is in the same solution space, whereas with my example the solution spaces are independent.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","sql-server-express","sql-server-2008-r2","user-instance"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":14,"up_vote_count":21,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":12990,"score":21,"question_id":281500,"title":"Error: Failed to generate a user instance of SQL Server","body":"<p>I'm trying to connect to an MDF.

I have to go into the web app's bin folder and delete the pdb files and then it'll let me delete the dll's most of the time. Every once in a while it doesn't let me so I have to close Visual Studio and then it lets me delete them. I checked and it's Visual Studio (devenv) that is locking the dll's. Rebooting the machine doesn't help.</p>\n\n<p>This is really reducing my productivity, is there anything I can do to resolve this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As mentioned, Visual Studio 2008 (devenv.exe) is the process locking the DLLs. </p>\n\n<p>I noticed something... When it compiles successfully, it's copying all the DLLs into the bin folder, then they are all deleted, then a new set are copied into the bin. When it isn't successfull, the first set of DLLs are copied in, then it fails. So it seems to be using the bin folder for 2 things when it should only be for 1.

The other reason they quoted was that since they were able to get the Full Install version of the .NET Framework 4.5 down to 50 MB's, that also reduced the need of creating a Client Profile version (since .NET 4.5 Full Install is only 9 MB's greater than the .NET 4.0 Client Profile), and only 1.

One project is an ASP.NET Web Application Project, and one is a class library. The web application has a project reference to the class library. Neither of these is strongly-named.</p>\n\n<p>In the class library, which I'll call \"Framework,\" I have an endpoint behavior (an IEndpointBehavior implementation) and a configuration element (a class derived from BehaviorExtensionsElement). The configuration element is so I can attach the endpoint behavior to a service via configuration.</p>\n\n<p>In the web application, I have an AJAX-enabled WCF service. In web.config, I have the AJAX service configured to use my custom behavior. The system.serviceModel section of the configuration is pretty standard and looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n &lt;behaviors&gt;\n  &lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n   &lt;behavior name=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n    &lt;enableWebScript /&gt;\n    &lt;customEndpointBehavior /&gt;\n   &lt;/behavior&gt;\n  &lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;\n &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n &lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n &lt;services&gt;\n &lt;service name=\"WebSite.AjaxService\"&gt;\n  &lt;endpoint\n           address=\"\"\n           behaviorConfiguration=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"\n           binding=\"webHttpBinding\"\n           contract=\"WebSite.AjaxService\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/service&gt;\n &lt;/services&gt;\n &lt;extensions&gt;\n  &lt;behaviorExtensions&gt;\n   &lt;add\n       name=\"customEndpointBehavior\"\n       type=\"Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/behaviorExtensions&gt;\n &lt;/extensions&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At runtime, this works perfectly. The AJAX enabled WCF service correctly uses my custom configured endpoint behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is when I try to add a new AJAX WCF service. If I do Add -> New Item... and select \"AJAX-enabled WCF Service,\" I can watch it add the .svc file and codebehind, but when it gets to updating the web.config file, I get this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The configuration file is not a valid configuration file for WCF Service Library.</p>\n  \n  <p>The type 'Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' registered for extension 'customEndpointBehavior' could not be loaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously the configuration is entirely valid since it works perfectly at runtime. If I remove the  element from my behavior configuration temporarily and then add the AJAX-enabled WCF Service, everything goes without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in a larger project where we will have multiple services with various configurations, removing all of the custom behaviors temporarily is going to be error prone.

It would be possible to simply register it as a native project with C# sources, however, you lose some of the advantages gained through having a C# project. More importantly, it will mean that allowing a project to build both directly and with an external tool (which is sadly necessary) will require two separate projects, rather than merely creating an alternate build configuration to invoke the external tool.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if it's possible to prevent Visual Studio from invoking <code>csc</code> by itself and instead call an external tool?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Apparently there has some misunderstanding. The goal here is not to compile anything outside of Visual Studio. Instead, it's to allow Visual Studio to serve as the IDE but not the build system. There is already a (Scons-based) build system capable of compiling the C# and C++ sources, and Visual Studio has been configured to invoke Scons for compilation of C++ projects. I'm trying to configure it so that when you hit the 'Build' button, it will invoke Scons for the C# projects as well as the C++ ones.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio","inline","breakpoints"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":1,"question_id":12911683,"title":"Breakpoints in inline function not being hit","body":"<p>I have a class declared in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef MYCLASS_H\n#define MYCLASS_H\n\nclass MyClass : public MyOtherClass\n{\n\npublic:\n    MyClass();\n\n    int a() const{ return _a; };\n    int b() const{ return _b; };\n\nprivate:\n    int _a;\n    int _b;\n};\n\ninline bool operator==( const MyClass&amp; lhs, const MyClass&amp; rhs )\n{\n    return (lhs.a() == rhs.a()) &amp;&amp; (lhs.b() == rhs.b());\n}\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that any breakpoints is set in the overloaded <code>operator==</code> never get hit, with Visual Studio even telling me that execution will never reach this function.

However, sometimes the slightest change, even adding and removing a space from the reference XML tags, or pressing Ctrl-Shift-J, results in the dreaded \"Error updating JScript IntelliSense: Client-side script IntelliSense information was not generated due to an error in an external script reference.\"  Except it was working with that external script reference just a second ago!</p>\n\n<p>For the jquery-vsdoc.js, I am using Comment Version 1.3.2b (that's what it says in the file) from <a href=\"http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc2.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc2.js</a>.

If unsaved data in file, dsoframer fails to open with a messagebox: \"Attempt to access invalid address\".  </p>\n\n<p>I built the source, and stepped through, and its making a call in its CDsoDocObject::CreateFromFile function, calling BindToObject on an object of class IMoniker.

On that failure, it tries to InstantiateDocObjectServer by classid of CLSID Microsoft Excel Worksheet... this fails with an HRESULT of 0x80040154 \"Class not registered\".  The InstantiateDocObjectServer just calls CoCreateInstance on the classid, first with CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, then (if that fails) with CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER.</p>\n\n<p>I know DSOFramer is a popular sample project for embedding Office apps in various dialogs and forms.

In CDsoDocObject, it tries to open key \"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID{00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\\DocObject\", but fails.  I've visually confirmed that the key is not present in my registry; The key is present for the guid, but there's no DocObject subkey.  It then produces an error message box: \"The associated COM server does not support ActiveX document embedding\".  I get similar (different key, of course) results when I try to use the Excel.Workbook programid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2: I tried starting a 2nd instance of Excel, hoping that my automation would bind to it (being the most recently invoked) instead of the problem Excel instance, but it didn't seem to do that.  Results were the same.  My problem seems to have boiled down to this:  I'm calling the BindToObject on an object of class IMoniker, and receiving 0x8001010A (RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER) \"The message filter indicated that the application is busy\".  I've tried playing with the flags passed to the BindToObject (via the SetBindOptions), but nothing seems to make any difference.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 3: It first tries to bind using an IMoniker class. If that fails, it calls CoCreateInstance for the clsid as a \"fallback\" method. This may work for other MS Office objects, but when it's Excel, the class is for the Worksheet. I modified the sample to CoCreateInstance _Application, then got the workbooks, then called the Workbooks::Open for the target file, which returns a Worksheet object.

The field is manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is I am taking read-only data from a massive Sybase server, filtering it and creating much smaller tables in Access daily (using delete and append Queries) and then doing a bunch of stuff. More specifically, I use a series of queries to either combine data from multiple tables or group data in specific ways (aggregate functions), and then I place this data into a table (so I can sort and manipulate data using DAO.recordset and run multiple custom algorithms). This process is then repeated multiple times throughout the database until a set of relevant tables are created.</p>\n\n<p>Many times I will create a field in a query with a value such as 1.1 so that when I append it to a table I can store information in the field from the algorithms. So as the process continues the number of fields for the tables change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall application consists of 4 \"back-end\" databases linked together on a shared drive, with various output (either front-end access applications or Excel).</p>\n\n<p>So my question is is this how many data driven applications that solve problems essentially work? Each backend database is updated with fresh data daily and updating each takes around 10 seconds (for three) and 2 minutes(for 1).</p>\n\n<p>Project Objectives. I want/am moving to SQL Server soon. Front End will be a Web Application (I know basic web-development and like the administration flexibility) and visual-studio will be IDE with c#/.NET.</p>\n\n<p>Should these algorithms be run \"inside the database,\" or using a series of C# functions on each server request. I know you're not supposed to store data in a database unless it is an actual data point, and in Access I have many columns that just hold calculations from algorithms in vba.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, I have seen multiple professional Access applications, and have never seen one that has the complexity or does even close to what mine does (for better or worse). But I know some professional software applications are 1000 times better then mine.</p>\n\n<p>So Please Please Please give me a suggestion of some sort.

What do other people with large systems do?</p>\n\n<p>FOLLOWUP:</p>\n\n<p>Lots of responses suggest breaking up the build into smaller .sln files...  In the example above, I would build the foundation classes \"C\" first, followed by the bulk of the modules \"B\", and then a few applications, \"A\".  In this model, I need to have non-project references to C from B.  The problem I run into there is that \"Debug\" or \"Release\" gets baked into the hint path and I wind up building my Release builds of \"B\" against debug builds of \"C\".  </p>\n\n<p>For those of you that split the build up into multiple .sln files, how do you manage this problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":12839660,"title":"How can visual studio determines version?","body":"<p>Think that I have two solutions: vs2009.sln and vs2010.sln.

I'm on Win XP SP3, using the builtin IIS 5.1.</p>\n\n<p>It started a few weeks ago, and happens across multiple projects. Something clearly changed in my environment, because it was working fine in the past, even in recent IDEs as long as I Attach to process. Then it broke as described below. I'd given up on it, but I started working on a new project recently, tried to debug and it worked! Today, though, it's back to the same broken behavior:</p>\n\n<p>When I try to set a breakpoint, the IDE actually sets the point a few lines above or below the line I clicked. I'm trying to set the breakpoint on lines that are entirely server-side code, so it's not because it's skipping before or after HTML with embedded code nuggets. Occasionally it won't set the breakpoint, giving me a hollow breakpoint icon and presenting an error that says there's no executable code on the line.</p>\n\n<p>When I attach to the IIS process (inetinfo.dll, as I'm running in low isolation mode), the breakpoint may not be hit. If it is, and I start single-stepping, the selected line jumps around, and doesn't land on every continuous line in the source, nor follow control structures as expected. Watched variables are not updated as expected. It's clearly seeing different code than I do for the same line numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The same behavior happens whether I load the page in a browser and</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attach to the process from VS2010, set a breakpoint and refresh the page, or</li>\n<li>set the breakpoint, attach to the process, and refresh, or</li>\n<li>add a 'stop' statement in my source, and refresh the page. In that case, I'm presented a list of available debuggers, and every one of them does exactly the same thing -- they skip the SAME lines of code and follow the SAME 'incorrect' paths. I've tried VS2010, 2008, 2005, 2003, and the Microsoft Script Debugger. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the source code is out of sync with what the debugger is stepping through. I've made certain that 'Require source files to exactly match the original version' is set in VS > Tools >Options > Debugging > General</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, these are ASP Classic sites -- there's no compiled code, so the source I see in the IDE should be the same as what the debugger's executing. It's not specific to one project -- it's happening on at least two completely separate projects at the moment. And, it's happening on multiple machines -- I deployed my project to a test server and tried to debug there, and got the same behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I found some information on similar-sounding problems related to UTF-encoded files containing non-ANSI characters (you know, the ones you use Unicode to support!) <a href=\"http://forums.iis.net/p/1096231/1655541.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928452\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiodev.com/visual-studio-debugger/incorrect-line-highlighted-when-debugging-serverside-with-asp-classic-16890.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I went thru my source and can't find any files like that.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

Same behaviour... if the service is implemented returning an interface type, it fails. If i change it to return the concrete type, it works.

And the installer starts shouting if it doesn't find all the files where it expects to find them:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FkL4n.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Actually, this isn't a problem because you can hit <strong>Continue</strong> and then everything works fine.</p>\n\n<p><em>Except</em> that actually it <strong>is</strong> a problem because if you're selling to Pepsi (we're not, but say we were) you sort of don't want the installer to moan that it can't find CocaCola.foo.dll in the middle of its install.</p>\n\n<p>We almost want an additional setting of <strong>Extremely Loose</strong> for the <strong>PackageAs</strong> field so that the installer knows not to even worry if it doesn't find the file.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a solution within our existing approach without having to learn a third-party installer?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio","asn.1"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":5,"view_count":50,"score":-5,"question_id":12785379,"title":"Asn.1 Encoder on C++","body":"<p>I need c++ encoder, desirable VS Project, that can encode my own structure to asn.1.\nWhat can you advise me?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","visual-studio"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":12785068,"title":"How to create project for existing site?","body":"<p>I have a web app that didn't come with a project file.
