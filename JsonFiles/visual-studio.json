I have always had a single lime of development.  However I get into the usual trouble when releasing and starting the next version - dealing with bugs.

I would then use Push or pull to get the bug fixes from the release copy into the beta copy (I think).</p>\n\n<p>I assume there must be another way however without cloning.  How would I do that?

All of those references have Copy Local set to 'True'.  Note that the code in the plugin assemblies (which are project references) is not referred to in \"ProjA\" directly, but is loaded and located through DI/Ninject.  (So I'm using these project references as a way of getting the plugin assemblies into the output folder, see below for why)</p>\n\n<p>I also have project \"ProjB\", which references ProjA.

Can I make it think any differently?</li>\n<li>I'm guessing that adding a Copy Local reference to the plugin assemblies as a way of having VS recognise a build dependency between the plugins and the project using them (currently a fixed set of plugins, hence this route) - is not ideal.  I then think that adding the plugin assemblies as 'Content' to the project would work, but then I have two issues: 1) TFS source control; the plugin projects need a writable target to build to, presumably - content files would be 'checked in' and 2) some of the plugins have Content of their own: with references I don't need to worry about missing something.  Going the Content route I need to refer to another project's build output folder, include all of it's content, but not the PDBs.. seems even more hacky!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have also considered and played with post-build steps for either the plugin projects (not ideal: I am pulling them into this new solution from another, if I add post-build steps it will likely screw up the other solution) or the project which depends on them (which is OK, but an XCopy with relative paths, and having to manually set up Project Dependencies.. seems more hacky again).</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I'm missing, any ideas at all?

This gave me objects with sizeof 8, 10 and 12. I ran code similar to the following for each :</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct MixedData1\n{\n    char Data1;\n    short Data2;\n    int Data3;\n    char Data4;\n\n    void operator() (MixedData1&amp; md)\n    {\n        md.Data1 = 'a';\n        md.Data2 = 1024;\n        md.Data3 = 1000000;\n        md.Data4 = 'b';\n    }\n};\n\ntypedef std::vector&lt;MixedData1&gt; MDVector;\n\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    MixedData1 md;\n    for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10 ; count++)\n    {    \n        {\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(md) &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n        boost::timer::auto_cpu_timer t;\n        MDVector mdv(10000000); \n        std::fill(mdv.begin(),mdv.end(),md );\n        std::for_each(mdv.begin(),mdv.end(),md);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not really interested in the values so each element in the vector is initialised the same. Anyway I got results that indicated that the running time increased with the size of the struct - I.E with pack(1) (8 bytes) I got the quickest 0.08s, and with normal alignment (12 bytes) I got the slowest 0.105 . </p>\n\n<p>My questions are about the effects of being wrongly aligned. I don't think I have ever had any issues with alignment throughout my <em>X</em> years as a C++ programmer, but of course it could have just passed me by. </p>\n\n<p>(1) The alignment had an effect (I believe) in my test (edit) <strong>however as Neil posted it was only due to the difference in struct size</strong>. I tried accessing the member as per his reply but I saw no real effect there.... is there a clearer example? Is there a way I can see a dramatic effect of misalignment?\n(2) Is there a way to induce a crash caused by misalignment if possible. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","visual-studio","control","design-time"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13198510,"title":"Shared data for component property at design time","body":"<p>I have a component which implements an <code>IExtenderProvider</code>.

Everything is working as expected.</p>\n\n<p>The only restriction with this setup is that I can't define widgets or helper using   <code>Q_OBJECT</code> in <em>.cpp</em> files. This would be very convenient for small, context-specific helpers classes that should appear right next to where they're used.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to pass the whole list of source files (both <em>.h</em> and <em>.cpp</em>) to <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code>, instead of just the header files, but that doesn't work (linking fails because some moc-related symbols are undefined).</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem is that, for a given pair of files <em>foo.h</em> and <em>foo.cpp</em>, the <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code> macro will generate the same moc file (<em>moc_foo.cxx</em>) in the same directory, and obviously that means the first file will be overwritten by the second one, and as a result symbols will be missing at link-time.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to fix or work around that problem? For instance, I tried to add a specific rule for <em>foo.cpp</em> of the form</p>\n\n<pre><code>QT4_GENERATE_MOC(directory/foo.cpp directory/foo.moc)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then add</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"foo.moc\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>at the end of <em>foo.cpp</em>. I think this ought to work, but alas Visual Studio only allows one build rule per file, and <em>.cpp</em> files already have a build rule (compilation to object file), so this approach doesn't work, at least with Visual Studio.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that I had was to create a new macro, say <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP_WITH_PREFIX</code>, based on <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP</code> (which is defined in <em>share/cmake-2.8/Modules/Qt4Macros.cmake</em>), that would take an additional prefix argument and would add this prefix to the generated moc files. That way, I would call <code>QT4_WRAP_CPP_WITH_PREFIX</code> twice, once for <em>.h</em> files and once for <em>.cpp</em> files, with different prefixes. What I just dislike about this approach is that I'd be messing with the internals of CMake's Qt support, instead of using the public API.</p>\n\n<p>Any better idea?</p>\n\n<p>Cheerz, Franz</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio","events","usercontrols"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":1,"question_id":13138753,"title":"Using an event only in Designer View before run time in Visual Studio","body":"<p>I guess this is a really odd and rare question!! </p>\n\n<p>I've made a certain Label control that inherits the <code>System.Windows.Forms.Label</code> object and thus becomes visible and usable in the designer view.

This would be quite probable because when you create the report, you select your database tables and fields over an ODBC link and it saves the connection information into the report I think :S</p>\n\n<p>So, after much scouring on the net, I found a way to avoid this error, but again, I do not believe it's reading the Web.config connectionString but rather the embedded connection in the .rpt file.</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            crystalReportSource.ReportDocument.SetDatabaseLogon(\"user\", \"real_pass\");\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works to circumvent the continuous prompt.

I'm aware that you can put a hit-count on regular break points, and you can just set the value really high to stop it from actually breaking at these points, but break point counters aren't immediately visible, so you have to hover over them one by one to see where execution stopped.

Why won't the Project 1 extensions list get filled?  Are my interface definitions wrong?  The sample calculator application is a simple command line project and that seems to work fine, the only difference I see is that the external DLL project is in the same solution space, whereas with my example the solution spaces are independent.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","sql-server-express","sql-server-2008-r2","user-instance"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":14,"up_vote_count":21,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13003,"score":21,"question_id":281500,"title":"Error: Failed to generate a user instance of SQL Server","body":"<p>I'm trying to connect to an MDF.

I have to go into the web app's bin folder and delete the pdb files and then it'll let me delete the dll's most of the time. Every once in a while it doesn't let me so I have to close Visual Studio and then it lets me delete them. I checked and it's Visual Studio (devenv) that is locking the dll's. Rebooting the machine doesn't help.</p>\n\n<p>This is really reducing my productivity, is there anything I can do to resolve this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As mentioned, Visual Studio 2008 (devenv.exe) is the process locking the DLLs. </p>\n\n<p>I noticed something... When it compiles successfully, it's copying all the DLLs into the bin folder, then they are all deleted, then a new set are copied into the bin. When it isn't successfull, the first set of DLLs are copied in, then it fails. So it seems to be using the bin folder for 2 things when it should only be for 1.

One project is an ASP.NET Web Application Project, and one is a class library. The web application has a project reference to the class library. Neither of these is strongly-named.</p>\n\n<p>In the class library, which I'll call \"Framework,\" I have an endpoint behavior (an IEndpointBehavior implementation) and a configuration element (a class derived from BehaviorExtensionsElement). The configuration element is so I can attach the endpoint behavior to a service via configuration.</p>\n\n<p>In the web application, I have an AJAX-enabled WCF service. In web.config, I have the AJAX service configured to use my custom behavior. The system.serviceModel section of the configuration is pretty standard and looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;\n &lt;behaviors&gt;\n  &lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n   &lt;behavior name=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n    &lt;enableWebScript /&gt;\n    &lt;customEndpointBehavior /&gt;\n   &lt;/behavior&gt;\n  &lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;\n &lt;/behaviors&gt;\n &lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n &lt;services&gt;\n &lt;service name=\"WebSite.AjaxService\"&gt;\n  &lt;endpoint\n           address=\"\"\n           behaviorConfiguration=\"MyEndpointBehavior\"\n           binding=\"webHttpBinding\"\n           contract=\"WebSite.AjaxService\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/service&gt;\n &lt;/services&gt;\n &lt;extensions&gt;\n  &lt;behaviorExtensions&gt;\n   &lt;add\n       name=\"customEndpointBehavior\"\n       type=\"Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/behaviorExtensions&gt;\n &lt;/extensions&gt;\n&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At runtime, this works perfectly. The AJAX enabled WCF service correctly uses my custom configured endpoint behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is when I try to add a new AJAX WCF service. If I do Add -> New Item... and select \"AJAX-enabled WCF Service,\" I can watch it add the .svc file and codebehind, but when it gets to updating the web.config file, I get this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The configuration file is not a valid configuration file for WCF Service Library.</p>\n  \n  <p>The type 'Framework.MyBehaviorExtensionsElement, Framework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' registered for extension 'customEndpointBehavior' could not be loaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously the configuration is entirely valid since it works perfectly at runtime. If I remove the  element from my behavior configuration temporarily and then add the AJAX-enabled WCF Service, everything goes without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in a larger project where we will have multiple services with various configurations, removing all of the custom behaviors temporarily is going to be error prone.

It would be possible to simply register it as a native project with C# sources, however, you lose some of the advantages gained through having a C# project. More importantly, it will mean that allowing a project to build both directly and with an external tool (which is sadly necessary) will require two separate projects, rather than merely creating an alternate build configuration to invoke the external tool.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if it's possible to prevent Visual Studio from invoking <code>csc</code> by itself and instead call an external tool?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Apparently there has some misunderstanding. The goal here is not to compile anything outside of Visual Studio. Instead, it's to allow Visual Studio to serve as the IDE but not the build system. There is already a (Scons-based) build system capable of compiling the C# and C++ sources, and Visual Studio has been configured to invoke Scons for compilation of C++ projects. I'm trying to configure it so that when you hit the 'Build' button, it will invoke Scons for the C# projects as well as the C++ ones.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio","inline","breakpoints"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":1,"question_id":12911683,"title":"Breakpoints in inline function not being hit","body":"<p>I have a class declared in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef MYCLASS_H\n#define MYCLASS_H\n\nclass MyClass : public MyOtherClass\n{\n\npublic:\n    MyClass();\n\n    int a() const{ return _a; };\n    int b() const{ return _b; };\n\nprivate:\n    int _a;\n    int _b;\n};\n\ninline bool operator==( const MyClass&amp; lhs, const MyClass&amp; rhs )\n{\n    return (lhs.a() == rhs.a()) &amp;&amp; (lhs.b() == rhs.b());\n}\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that any breakpoints is set in the overloaded <code>operator==</code> never get hit, with Visual Studio even telling me that execution will never reach this function.

However, sometimes the slightest change, even adding and removing a space from the reference XML tags, or pressing Ctrl-Shift-J, results in the dreaded \"Error updating JScript IntelliSense: Client-side script IntelliSense information was not generated due to an error in an external script reference.\"  Except it was working with that external script reference just a second ago!</p>\n\n<p>For the jquery-vsdoc.js, I am using Comment Version 1.3.2b (that's what it says in the file) from <a href=\"http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc2.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc2.js</a>.

If unsaved data in file, dsoframer fails to open with a messagebox: \"Attempt to access invalid address\".  </p>\n\n<p>I built the source, and stepped through, and its making a call in its CDsoDocObject::CreateFromFile function, calling BindToObject on an object of class IMoniker.

On that failure, it tries to InstantiateDocObjectServer by classid of CLSID Microsoft Excel Worksheet... this fails with an HRESULT of 0x80040154 \"Class not registered\".  The InstantiateDocObjectServer just calls CoCreateInstance on the classid, first with CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, then (if that fails) with CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER.</p>\n\n<p>I know DSOFramer is a popular sample project for embedding Office apps in various dialogs and forms.

In CDsoDocObject, it tries to open key \"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID{00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\\DocObject\", but fails.  I've visually confirmed that the key is not present in my registry; The key is present for the guid, but there's no DocObject subkey.  It then produces an error message box: \"The associated COM server does not support ActiveX document embedding\".  I get similar (different key, of course) results when I try to use the Excel.Workbook programid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2: I tried starting a 2nd instance of Excel, hoping that my automation would bind to it (being the most recently invoked) instead of the problem Excel instance, but it didn't seem to do that.  Results were the same.  My problem seems to have boiled down to this:  I'm calling the BindToObject on an object of class IMoniker, and receiving 0x8001010A (RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER) \"The message filter indicated that the application is busy\".  I've tried playing with the flags passed to the BindToObject (via the SetBindOptions), but nothing seems to make any difference.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 3: It first tries to bind using an IMoniker class. If that fails, it calls CoCreateInstance for the clsid as a \"fallback\" method. This may work for other MS Office objects, but when it's Excel, the class is for the Worksheet. I modified the sample to CoCreateInstance _Application, then got the workbooks, then called the Workbooks::Open for the target file, which returns a Worksheet object.

The field is manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is I am taking read-only data from a massive Sybase server, filtering it and creating much smaller tables in Access daily (using delete and append Queries) and then doing a bunch of stuff. More specifically, I use a series of queries to either combine data from multiple tables or group data in specific ways (aggregate functions), and then I place this data into a table (so I can sort and manipulate data using DAO.recordset and run multiple custom algorithms). This process is then repeated multiple times throughout the database until a set of relevant tables are created.</p>\n\n<p>Many times I will create a field in a query with a value such as 1.1 so that when I append it to a table I can store information in the field from the algorithms. So as the process continues the number of fields for the tables change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall application consists of 4 \"back-end\" databases linked together on a shared drive, with various output (either front-end access applications or Excel).</p>\n\n<p>So my question is is this how many data driven applications that solve problems essentially work? Each backend database is updated with fresh data daily and updating each takes around 10 seconds (for three) and 2 minutes(for 1).</p>\n\n<p>Project Objectives. I want/am moving to SQL Server soon. Front End will be a Web Application (I know basic web-development and like the administration flexibility) and visual-studio will be IDE with c#/.NET.</p>\n\n<p>Should these algorithms be run \"inside the database,\" or using a series of C# functions on each server request. I know you're not supposed to store data in a database unless it is an actual data point, and in Access I have many columns that just hold calculations from algorithms in vba.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, I have seen multiple professional Access applications, and have never seen one that has the complexity or does even close to what mine does (for better or worse). But I know some professional software applications are 1000 times better then mine.</p>\n\n<p>So Please Please Please give me a suggestion of some sort.

What do other people with large systems do?</p>\n\n<p>FOLLOWUP:</p>\n\n<p>Lots of responses suggest breaking up the build into smaller .sln files...  In the example above, I would build the foundation classes \"C\" first, followed by the bulk of the modules \"B\", and then a few applications, \"A\".  In this model, I need to have non-project references to C from B.  The problem I run into there is that \"Debug\" or \"Release\" gets baked into the hint path and I wind up building my Release builds of \"B\" against debug builds of \"C\".  </p>\n\n<p>For those of you that split the build up into multiple .sln files, how do you manage this problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":12839660,"title":"How can visual studio determines version?","body":"<p>Think that I have two solutions: vs2009.sln and vs2010.sln.

I'm on Win XP SP3, using the builtin IIS 5.1.</p>\n\n<p>It started a few weeks ago, and happens across multiple projects. Something clearly changed in my environment, because it was working fine in the past, even in recent IDEs as long as I Attach to process. Then it broke as described below. I'd given up on it, but I started working on a new project recently, tried to debug and it worked! Today, though, it's back to the same broken behavior:</p>\n\n<p>When I try to set a breakpoint, the IDE actually sets the point a few lines above or below the line I clicked. I'm trying to set the breakpoint on lines that are entirely server-side code, so it's not because it's skipping before or after HTML with embedded code nuggets. Occasionally it won't set the breakpoint, giving me a hollow breakpoint icon and presenting an error that says there's no executable code on the line.</p>\n\n<p>When I attach to the IIS process (inetinfo.dll, as I'm running in low isolation mode), the breakpoint may not be hit. If it is, and I start single-stepping, the selected line jumps around, and doesn't land on every continuous line in the source, nor follow control structures as expected. Watched variables are not updated as expected. It's clearly seeing different code than I do for the same line numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The same behavior happens whether I load the page in a browser and</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attach to the process from VS2010, set a breakpoint and refresh the page, or</li>\n<li>set the breakpoint, attach to the process, and refresh, or</li>\n<li>add a 'stop' statement in my source, and refresh the page. In that case, I'm presented a list of available debuggers, and every one of them does exactly the same thing -- they skip the SAME lines of code and follow the SAME 'incorrect' paths. I've tried VS2010, 2008, 2005, 2003, and the Microsoft Script Debugger. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the source code is out of sync with what the debugger is stepping through. I've made certain that 'Require source files to exactly match the original version' is set in VS > Tools >Options > Debugging > General</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, these are ASP Classic sites -- there's no compiled code, so the source I see in the IDE should be the same as what the debugger's executing. It's not specific to one project -- it's happening on at least two completely separate projects at the moment. And, it's happening on multiple machines -- I deployed my project to a test server and tried to debug there, and got the same behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I found some information on similar-sounding problems related to UTF-encoded files containing non-ANSI characters (you know, the ones you use Unicode to support!) <a href=\"http://forums.iis.net/p/1096231/1655541.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928452\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiodev.com/visual-studio-debugger/incorrect-line-highlighted-when-debugging-serverside-with-asp-classic-16890.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I went thru my source and can't find any files like that.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

But for each client there's a custom DLL which fits their solution. The custom DLL is loaded dynamically at runtime by the software and that's working fine.

Currently, my project file has something like this within (abbreviated):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=\"AfterBuild\"&gt;\n  &lt;AfterThoughtTask TargetAssembly=\"$(TargetPath)\" AmendWith=\"$(TargetDir)Amendments.dll\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Target&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically it's saying: after the build, use the AfterThoughtTask which runs a process to modify the output assembly with code found in Amendments.dll. This works just fine as I'd expect, and the MyProject.dll output to <code>MyProject\\bin\\Debug\\MyProject.dll</code> is amended with the additional code. </p>\n\n<p>Then I make this slight change to my project file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\n  &lt;OutputPath&gt;SomeOtherProjectLocation\\bin\\&lt;/OutputPath&gt;\n&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So all I've done is change the output path. Now I debug <code>AfterThoughtTask</code>, and hit a breakpoint after all the code has been executed. When I'm stopped on this breakpoint, the file <code>SomeOtherProjectLocation\\bin\\MyProject.dll</code> (which is the file I intended to amend, sitting in the folder I expect it to be in) appears to be amended (has a file size of 117kb vs 103kb when unamended). It appears as if things are going fine at this point. Then I release the breakpoint, and suddenly the file size drops back to 103kb, somehow getting replaced with the original unamended file. Looking at the diagnostic build report, <code>AfterThoughtTask</code> is the very last task run with no reported file copies after it.</p>\n\n<p>Running again at the same breakpoint, I see that the file sitting in the <code>IntermediateOutputPath</code> directory (obj\\Debug) is still 103kb (unamended), so I try to see if that is the file that is overwriting the amended one. When I'm at the breakpoint (the end of the task execution, but before control is given back to the build), I rename the file in the <code>IntermediateOutputPath</code> directory to MyProject.dll_hidden. I get no errors, but my file is no longer written over.</p>\n\n<p>So I can only assume that the file is being copied from the <code>IntermediateOutputPath</code> directory over the target file, but the build log doesn't seem to indicate this, and I don't understand why changing the <code>OutputPath</code> would make it happen this way vs. how it was acting before with the default <code>OutputPath</code>.

Also, this option appears to be set by default (ie: I think its set to this out of the box).</p>\n\n<p>What I am trying to figure out is, if I have the second option selected, do I get the third option (Break on Unhandled Errors) for free? In that, does it come included by default for all scenarios outside of the Class Module spectrum? To advise, I don't have any Class Modules in my currently active project. I have .bas modules though. Also, is it possible that by Class Mdules they may be referring to normal .bas Modules as well? (this is my second sub-question).</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I just want the setting to ensure there won't be any surprises once the exe is released. I want as many errors to display as possible while I am developing, and non to be displayed when in release mode. Normally, I have two types of On Error Resume Next on my forms where there isn't explicit error handling, they are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>On Error Resume Next ' REQUIRED\nOn Error Resume Next ' NOT REQUIRED</p>\n\n<p>The required ones are things like, checking to see if an array has any length, if a call to its UBound errors out, that means it has no length, if it returns a value 0 or more, then it does have length (and therefore, exists). These types of Error Statements need to remain active even while I am developing. However, the NOT REQUIRED ones shouldn't remain active while I am developing, so I have them all commented out to ensure that I catch all the errors that exist.</p>\n\n<p>Once I am ready to release the exe, I do a CTRL+H to find all occurrences of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'On Error Resume Next ' NOT REQUIRED</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(You may have noticed they are commented out)... And replace them with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Error Resume Next ' NOT REQUIRED</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... The uncommented version, so that in release mode, if there are any leftover errors, they do not show to users.</p>\n\n<p>For more on the description by MSDN on the three options (which I've read twice and still don't find adequate) you can visit the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yUQZZK2n2IYJ:support.microsoft.com/kb/129876&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_tr&amp;gl=au&amp;tbs=lr:lang_1en%7Clang_1tr&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;strip=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yUQZZK2n2IYJ:support.microsoft.com/kb/129876&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_tr&amp;gl=au&amp;tbs=lr:lang_1en%7Clang_1tr&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;strip=1</a></p>\n\n<p>I’m also interested in hearing your thoughts if you feel like volunteering them (and this would be my tentative/totally optional third sub-question, that being, your thoughts on fall-back error handling techniques).</p>\n\n<p>Just to summarize, the first two questions were, do we get option 3 included in all non-class scenarios if we choose option 2?

I’ve added DOM\\IWAM_WebServer as the Application Pool Identity.  I’ve disabled Anonymous Logon to the folder where this web application is run from and I’ve enabled Integrated Windows Authentication.  On the client, I’ve added this website to the Intranet Zone and have confirmed that it correctly passes the credentials and identifies me.  On the FileServer, I’ve added “Everyone” with full control on the SharedFolder and DOM\\IWAM_WebServer with full control on the folder’s security ACLs.  I also found an article that talked about the ANONYMOUS LOGON group no longer being part of the “Everyone” group, so I added that one with full control to both the share and the security ACL. I've also disabled UAC on the FileServer.</p>\n\n<h2>Test Results</h2>\n\n<p>When I execute the code from the WebServer I see the following in the server event logs on the FileServer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Event Id 4624: Logon by NULL SID, logon type 3, security ID\nDOM\\WebServer$, account name WebServer$, logon process Kerberos.</li>\n<li>Event Id 5140: File Share by DOM\\WebServer$ to \\*\\IPC$. </li>\n<li>Event Id 5145: Detailed File Share by DOM\\WebServer$ to \\*\\IPC$, relative target .</li>\n<li>Event Id 4624: Logon by NULL SID, logon type 3, security ID ANONYMOUS LOGON, account name ANONYMOUS LOGON, logon process NtLmSsp, authentication package NTLM, Package name (NTLM only) NTLM V1.</li>\n<li>Event Id 4634: Logoff of the ANONYMOUS LOGON (verified by matching the Logon ID). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When I execute the code from the VS2010 debugger on my PC (where it successfully copies the file), I see the following in the server event logs on the FileServer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Event Id 4672: Special Logon by security ID DOM\\me.</li>\n<li>Event Id 4624: Logon by NULL SID, logon type 3, security ID DOM\\me, account name me, logon process Kerberos.</li>\n<li>Event Id 5140: File Share by DOM\\me to \\*\\IPC$. </li>\n<li>Event Id 5140: File Share by DOM\\me to \\*\\SharedFolder.</li>\n<li>Event Id 5145: Detailed File Share by DOM\\me to \\*\\SharedFolder, relative target FileName.csv.</li>\n<li>Event Id 5145: Detailed File Share by DOM\\me to \\*\\SharedFolder, relative target FileName.csv.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Request</h2>\n\n<p>I am stumped.

I wrote a little program to create a .cpp file with static initializers, but one can find them on the net. When compiled into the program, the .cpp file creates a copy of the image file in read-only memory. The .rc file is a Windows-specific thing, so it would be a good idea to avoid using it for custom icons and cursors, for portability. However, it does make sense to have a .rc file in the MS project that contains only the line \"#include &LT;wx/msw/wx.rc>\" That will give access to some stock cursors and so forth that are available by default on other platforms.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","winforms","visual-studio-2010","visual-studio"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":3,"question_id":12319328,"title":"How to see both sides of a partial class","body":"<p>I am creating a Windows Form and the class is declare as partial.

The import uses a table to hold all of the values imported from a flat file before exporting those values into a permanent table.  For example, the flat file itself is imported into 'mytable'.  The contents of 'mytable' are then transferred to 'mypermanenttable'.  I recently added a drop mytable SQL statement to the end of the SSIS package.  Since I am now missing 'mytable' when I run the SSIS package again, I added a T-SQL statement to before the 'Preparation SQL Task 1' step in Control Flow that would create 'mytable' before the import begins.  I get an error when I try running the entire SSIS package.  I can however run every step of the SSIS process one by one and complete the entire package without any problems this way.

There are times where my site loads very fast under this setup.]</p>\n\n<p>I load in IE 9 usually, but the same problem happens in FireFox.</p>\n\n<p>This can happen in any MVC project I work on, and seems to revolve around having DisplayTemplates, which all my MVC projects do. And it's all C# &amp; Razor, if that mattered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The system will load my symbols <em>hundreds</em> of times. Basically, the following, but there are at least 300 such rows, each with ever-so-slightly different DLLs for the same CSHTMLs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_contact.cshtml.22013bb9.xighmhow.dll', Symbols loaded.\n'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_contact.cshtml.22013bb9.cv5hktkf.dll', Symbols loaded.\n'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_statuscode.cshtml.22013bb9.1o77hs8i.dll', Symbols loaded.\n'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_statuscode.cshtml.22013bb9.jja-77mw.dll', Symbols loaded.\n'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_location.cshtml.22013bb9.l_e9ev_s.dll', Symbols loaded.\n'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\b63f8236\\6775085d\\App_Web_location.cshtml.22013bb9.b4n59gom.dll', Symbols loaded.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above, I've got 3 DisplayTemplates: \"Contact\", \"Location\", and \"StatusCode\". It appears that IIS is loading symbols twice for each time the displaytemplate gets called. Thus, if I'm displaying a table of 100 entries that calls all 3 of these displaytemplates, it's 600 separate symbols loaded.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a fast operation either. Looking in the log files that IIS generates, it takes about 200ms for each symbol to load. Thus, super-long delays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I've Tried:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debug or Release version, doesn't matter.</li>\n<li>Putting my project on a full IIS implementation on a web server runs it super fast with no problems.</li>\n<li>Cassini, iisexpress 7.5, iisexpress 8.0 all have the problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Delete All Breakpoints does nothing.</strong></li>\n<li>Clean Solution, or deleting the .suo also do nothing.</li>\n<li>If I repair IISExpress, or delete the My Docs\\IISExpress folder, or repair/reinstall Visual Studio -> the issue MAY go away, but only for a while, before it comes right back. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any advice at all is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>---- Edit #1 -----</p>\n\n<p>To answer more questions, yes my machine definitely has the horsepower. The infuriating thing is that the same project, with NOTHING altered, can load very very quickly sometimes, typically after I repair IISExpress &amp; delete the My Docs\\IISExpress folder. Eventually \"something\" happens and it's down to 2 minutes to load again. What I'm working on is not a complicated project. No external libraries or dependencies, and my VS.NET has no addons what-so-ever.</p>\n\n<p>Of note, this machine has Symantec Endpoint Protection, which has a history of causing havoc. But disabling it outright (its good to be an admin) did not fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I have a theory at this point. I'm thinking this is all because I'm working off a redirected folder off a network share. While the debugger was going through it's hundreds of \"loaded symbols\" lines, I paused to see what it was doing. It was in my code, loading the DisplayTemplate I had.

My theory is that VS compiles the file, saves it to the network share, the network share then somehow stamps a new time on it, and VS then thinks the file has changed and thus VS recompiles it yet again. Only a theory though; I really have no clue.</p>\n\n<p>For one, apparently I have offline files on (this is a desktop computer in an office; I couldn't care less). I'm going to disable, reboot and retry tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, moving my project, as is, to the local C: fixes it. It loads very quickly. But this is not ideal in a work environment.

I read that for a User Control <code>this.DesignMode</code> will always be false, and so it should be checked in the Load event as I've done here, except I still can't use Design View.

Previously, this same error occured but on a different function/variable, and the resolution was to open up upnp.dll in oleview.exe (to view Type Library Information) and to replace all occurences of \"Unsigned Long\" with just \"Long\" and then compile a new TypeLib with the \"Unsigned\" keywords removed, this solved the problem for that senario.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I need to solve the same problem but for a different function/variable, but the problem is, I have no idea which variable datatype I need to change or remove when I'm in oleview's TypeLib view of upnp.dll.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness, I'll let you know where this error is occuring, and then I will show you the relevant part of the oleview/TypeLib view that I am having trouble modifying. (for your information, upnp.dll is contained in windows\\system32 and oleview.exe comes with the Windows SDK Toolkit if you do not already have it on your machine).</p>\n\n<p>I am calling the function <code>.InvokeAction sActionName, aryIns, aryOuts</code> where aryIns and aryOuts are Variants declared like this: <code>Dim aryIns As Variant, aryIns As Variant</code> - basically, I declare it generally, put any input data I need inside aryIns and I will get aryOuts with the results of the InvokeAction call. The good thing is, InvokeAction turns my general Variant into a properly dimensioned array reflecting the number of output items that are returned for the ActionName I'm using.</p>\n\n<p>Re the point I'm getting the error, I am using (for sActionName) \"GetStatusInfo\" on a \"WanIPConnection\" under the \"WAN Connection Device\". I don't need to define any items for aryIns since this call doesn't require or need any input arguments, but it provided (returns) 3 items (results) and puts them in aryOuts. So aryOuts ends up as an array with items from index 0 to 2 (3 items total)... and when I loop through this aryOuts array, the items 0 and 1 are printed out and viewed perfectly (without problems) but on the 3rd item (aryOuts(2)) I get the above exception.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the first 2 arguments are just simple strings (no problem accessing these) but the 3rd argument is defined by the UPnP people as an <code>Unsigned 4 Byte Integer</code> (and this is where the problem lays), VB6 is unable to interpret this datatype and is not letting me access this array item (aryOuts(2)), and I could not figure out what part of the TypeLib I need to modify, since the definition for InvokeAction aryOuts is just stated as a VARIANT* in the TypeLib, and here is the relevant part of the TypeLib for your view (I've included the area I understand to be relevant, if you would like additional areas posted, let me know and I can do this):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n  odl,\n  uuid(A295019C-DC65-47DD-90DC-7FE918A1AB44),\n  helpstring(\"IUPnPService Interface\"),\n  dual,\n  nonextensible,\n  oleautomation\n]\ninterface IUPnPService : IDispatch {\n    [id(0x600209c5), helpstring(\"method QueryStateVariable\")]\n    HRESULT QueryStateVariable(\n                    [in] BSTR bstrVariableName, \n                    [out, retval] VARIANT* pValue);\n    [id(0x600209c6), helpstring(\"method InvokeAction\")]\n    HRESULT InvokeAction(\n                    [in] BSTR bstrActionName, \n                    [in] VARIANT vInActionArgs, \n                    [in, out] VARIANT* pvOutActionArgs, \n                    [out, retval] VARIANT* pvRetVal);\n    [id(0x600209c7), propget, helpstring(\"property ServiceTypeIdentifier\")]\n    HRESULT ServiceTypeIdentifier([out, retval] BSTR* pVal);\n    [id(0x600209c8), helpstring(\"method AddStateChangeCallback\")]\n    HRESULT AddCallback([in] IUnknown* pUnkCallback);\n    [id(0x600209c9), propget, helpstring(\"property Id\")]\n    HRESULT Id([out, retval] BSTR* pbstrId);\n    [id(0x600209ca), propget, helpstring(\"property LastTransportStatus\")]\n    HRESULT LastTransportStatus([out, retval] long* plValue);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The aryOuts() array I was talking about before is defined by the <strong><code>[in, out] VARIANT* pvOutActionArgs</code></strong> line in the <strong><code>InvokeAction</code></strong> declaration (in the TypeLib above).

Let's call it <em>CPP Project</em>. It currently works in an unmanaged environment. In addition, I have created a WPF project, that shall be called <em>WPF Project</em>. This project is a simple and currently almost empty project. It contains a single window and I want it to use code from Project 1. For that, I have created a CLR C++ project, which shall be called <em>Interop Project</em> and is also compiled as a DLL.</p>\n\n<p>For simplicity I will attach some basic testing code I have boiled down to the basics.</p>\n\n<p>CPP Project has the following two testing files:</p>\n\n<p><strong>tester.h</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma once\nextern \"C\" class __declspec(dllexport) NativeTester\n{\npublic:\n    void NativeTest();\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>tester.cpp</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"tester.h\"\n    void NativeTester::NativeTest()\n    {\n        int i = 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interop Project has the following file:</p>\n\n<p><strong>InteropLib.h</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma once\n#include &lt;tester.h&gt;\nusing namespace System;\nnamespace InteropLib {\n    public ref class InteropProject\n    {\n    public:\n        static void Test()\n        {\n            NativeTester nativeTester;\n            nativeTester.NativeTest();\n        }\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, WPF Project has a single window refrencing Interop Project:</p>\n\n<p><strong>MainWindow.xaml.cs</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Windows;\nusing InteropLib;\nnamespace AppGUI\n{\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window\n    {\n        public MainWindow()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            InteropProject.Test();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the XAML itself has an empty window (default created).</p>\n\n<p>Once I am trying to run the WPF project, I get the following error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException: 'The invocation of the constructor on type 'AppGUI.MainWindow' that matches the specified binding constraints threw an exception.' Line number '3' and line position '9'. ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'InteropLib.dll' or one of its dependencies. The specified module could not be found.<br>\n     at AppGUI.MainWindow..ctor()</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, if I do not export the class from CPP Project, I do not get this error. Say, if i change <code>tester.h</code> to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma once\nclass NativeTester\n{\npublic:\n    void NativeTest()\n    {\n        int i = 0;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, in this case I cannot use my more complex classes. If I move my implementation to a cpp file like before, I get unresolved linkage errors due to my not exporting my code. The C++ code I want to actually use is large and has many classes and is object oriented, so I can't just move all my implementation to the h files. </p>\n\n<p>Please help me understand this horrific error I've been trying resolve without success.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","visual-studio","debugging","asp.net-development-serv","disable-caching"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":140,"score":1,"question_id":12285594,"title":"Visual Studio ASP.NET development server keeps returning old pages","body":"<p>I have created an ASP.NET 4 based website. \nAt first I ran the default site as it was generated by Visual Studio ASP.NET 4 Internet Application template.

It should only use console. I have a decent experience with OOP from PHP and C++ but I still cannot figure this out.</p>\n\n<p>80% of the text game is already working so I won't bore you with classes and stuff that already works and is not related to the problem. Ok let's get started:</p>\n\n<p>Each command in the game (what you can type into the console and hit enter) is represented by a single class both extending an abstract class and an interface from the library I am supposed to built the game on. Bellow is a class Use which represents a command for using items (e.g. you type \"use sword\" into the console and the game will look for an item called sword and call its use method):</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\n\nnamespace Game.Commands\n{\n    class Use : TextGame.Commands.ACommand, TextGame.Commands.ICommand\n    {\n        private string name;\n        public new string Name\n        {\n            set { this.name = value; }\n            get { return this.name; }\n        }\n\n        private string description;\n        public new string Description\n        {\n            set { this.description = value; }\n            get { return this.description; }\n        }\n\n        private string parameters;\n        public new string Params\n        {\n            set { this.parameters = value; }\n            get { return this.parameters; }\n        }\n\n        public Use(string name, string description) : base(name, description)\n        {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.description = description;\n        }\n\n        private TextGame.Core.GameState gameState;\n        public TextGame.Core.GameState Execute(TextGame.Core.IGame game)\n        {\n            // This is just a test because it appears the problem is\n            // with the parameters property.

This will force the code to run through the entire array for each new time point ~50k times.</p>\n\n<p>Create a boolean in the array with my timedata that will become true if the value has been used. This will use a boolean check of the point has been used before the datetime comparison which should be faster.</p>\n\n<p>Reorganize the array into order, I am not sure how long this would take based on datetimes. It would greatly increase the time required to import data in the first place, however it could make the scaling query much faster. Any idea on vaguely the ratio of time it would take to reorder the array compared to running it out of order?</p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I will add some code if people feel it is necessary.

This program should be constructed in multiple files. The main function should be in one file, the other functions should be in a second source file, and their prototypes should be in a header file. First I write a short function that returns a random value between 1 and 6 to simulate the rolling of a single 6-sided die.Second, i write a function that pretends to roll a pair of dice by calling this function twice.\nMy program starts by asking the user how many rolls should be made. Then I write a function to simulate rolling the dice this many times, keeping a count of exactly how many times the values 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12(each number is the sum of a pair of dice) occur in an array. Later I write a function to display a small bar chart using these counts that ideally would look something like below for a sample of 144 rolls, where the number of asterisks printed corresponds to the count:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10    11    12\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     *     *\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     *     *\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     *     *\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     *     *\n     *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     *     \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, to see how well the random number generator is doing, I write a function to compute the average value rolled. Compare this to the ideal average of 7. Also, print out a small table showing the counts of each roll made by the program, the ideal count based on the frequencies above given the total number of rolls, and the difference between these values in separate columns.

However, I do like the convenience of using STL objects for some of the function calls. I came up with something that seems to work, but was wondering if there may be some hidden things that I'm just not thinking of.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I came up with to get STL versions of functions while still maintaining Visual Studio independence.</p>\n\n<p>Original library function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//library.h\n...\nstd::wstring GetSomeString();\n...\nStringGenerator* mStrGen; //assume forward declared for pimpl implementation\n\n//library.cpp\nstd::wstring library::GetSomeString()\n{\n  return mStrGen-&gt;GetString(); //returns a wstring;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, I created a private function that would provide the C interface</p>\n\n<pre><code>//library.h\n__declspec(dllexport) void GetSomeStringInternal(wchar_t* pSomeString);\n\n//library.cpp\nvoid library::GetSomeString(wchar_t*&amp; pSomeString)\n{\n    if(pSomeString!= nullptr) {\n        delete [] pSomeString; //assumes allocated by the DLL\n    }\n\n    std::wstring tmpString(mStrGen-&gt;GetString());\n\n    size_t stringLength(tmpString.size());\n\n    stringToReturn = new wchar_t[stringLength + 1];\n\n    wcscpy_s(pSomeString, stringLength + 1, tmpString.c_str());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, I added a private function that deallocates memory allocated by the DLL</p>\n\n<pre><code>//library.h\n__declspec(dllexport) void FreeArray(void* arrayPtr);\n\n//library.cpp\nvoid library::FreeArray(void* arrayPtr)\n{\n if(arrayPtr) {\n   delete [] arrayPtr; \n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, I converted the original C++ function returning a string into a function that calls the internal C interface function</p>\n\n<pre><code>//library.h\n\nstd::wstring GetSomeString()\n{\n  std::wstring someString(L\"\");\n  wchar_t* pSomeString= NULL;\n\n  GetSomeStringInternal(pSomeString);\n  someString = pSomeString;\n\n  FreeArray(pSomeString);\n  return someString;\n}\n\n//library.cpp\n//removed GetSomeString from cpp since it is defined in header\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My thinking is that since the header will be compiled every time it is included, an application that uses a different version of the CRT will compile the function using its implementation of the CRT. All data passed into and out of the library uses a C interface to preserve compatibility and memory is allocated and freed by the library so you don't run into one version of the CRT trying to free memory from a different version.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to perform as I intend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The library can be used by programs compiled with multiple versions of Visual Studio.</li>\n<li>There are no memory leaks or access violations</li>\n<li>If I modify the code so that memory is allocated in the GetSomeString function in the header, I do get a memory access error when trying to free that memory.</li>\n<li>The GetSomeString function is compiled by the library and included in the DLL, but it is never called since it is 1) not exported and 2) the compiling program will always choose its version since it is inlined.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there anything I am missing, or is this a valid way of going about providing a C++ interface to a library that is Visual Studio version independent?</p>\n\n<p>Side note: I have run into some deletion issues if I have a program that uses a <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;library&gt;</code>, but haven't researched that issue enough and will probably have a follow up question on that problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","hyperlink"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":43,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3590,"score":43,"question_id":1201570,"title":"How do I open links in Visual Studio in my web browser and not in Visual Studio?","body":"<p>If there is a URL in a source file comment, I can \"CTRL + click to follow link.\"  However, when I do this, the link opens inside Visual Studio.

I recently decided to take the time to get them all organized in one location so I can reference them from any of my solutions.  I started with a Class Library project and added a bunch of different functions and some derived controls that I use.  Some of the functions are used by the derived controls as well as being called directly from applications.  I built the project and started using the DLL in my projects.</p>\n\n<p>I have a few questions regarding this custom DLL (I am using Visual C# 2010 Express):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem to work quite like the stock Microsoft libraries.  For instance, I can have \"using System.Windows.Controls;\" in a program, but I can only reference the namespace of my custom library with the using directive.  It would be nice to organize my classes in a similar fashion if it makes sense to do so.  Is it possible to have the classes nested like the Microsoft ones?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>edit: For example... If I type at the top of my application code \"using System.\", I get a bunch of sub-namespaces to choose from.  I continue typing \"Windows.\", and I get more sub-categories.  If I add a reference to MyCustom.dll and start typing \"using MyCustom.\", I don't see any of my classes or subclasses.  I'm just asking how to organize things within my class library so they behave like the stock libraries.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is it a good idea to make one big DLL file with all of my reusable code?  I don't have a ton of code at the moment, but I want to leave room for expansion.

I later add some features or make a change to that function for Application2 that I am building.  If the new features break Application1 or change something in an undesirable way, what happens when a user installs Application2?  Is my custom DLL shared between the applications or does each application have its own version of my DLL?  Obviously, I would build a new version of Application1 to make it work with the new DLL, but there is no guarantee that the user would update it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","search"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2199,"score":5,"question_id":1508973,"title":"How to search for file names in Visual Studio?","body":"<p>In <strong>Eclipse</strong> you can search for a file in the project by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd>.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to do this in <strong>Visual Studio</strong>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":12,"up_vote_count":23,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13303,"score":23,"question_id":70013,"title":"how to detect if I'm compiling code under visual studio 8?","body":"<p>Is there any way to know if I'm compiling under Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","git"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":213,"score":3,"question_id":8025108,"title":"integrating Git Bash with Visual Studio","body":"<p>I have a windows version of Git Bash, and I want to use it with my Visual Studio Projects.

(and \"what part\" of Visual C++ -- the compiler, the CRT, the Windows SDK?)</p>\n\n<p>For example, I think I know that VC6 is the last version of VS that can be used to create executables that run on Windows NT4.

Basically, create a DLL project which actually defines a PROJECT_EXPORTS in the Project.h file. Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Assume the name of the project is SanProj and the header file is SanProj.h\n#ifdef SANPROJ_EXPORTS\n    #define SANPROJ_API __declspec(dllexport)\n#else\n    #define SANPROJ_API __declspec(dllimport)\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the normal way of using this header is to include this in all the headers of your API classes and using SANPROJ_EXPORTS for \"exporting\" declarations when in the DLL and \"importing\" declarations when used as a client. For e.g. let's say we have a header file with a currency class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// currency.hpp\n#include \"SanProj.h\"\n#include &lt;ostream&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n\nnamespace SanProj {\n\n    class SANPROJ_API Currency {\n\n    public:\n        Currency();\n        const std::string&amp; name();\n        const std::string&amp; code();\n        bool empty() const;\n\n    protected:\n        std::string name_;\n        std::string code_;\n    };\n\n    SANPROJ_API bool operator==(const Currency&amp;,\n                    const Currency&amp;);\n\n    SANPROJ_API bool operator!=(const Currency&amp;,\n                    const Currency&amp;);\n\n    SANPROJ_API std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, Currency&amp; c);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And another header file with specific currencies:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// allccy.hpp\nnamespace SanProj {\n\n    class SANPROJ_API USDCurrency : public Currency {\n    public:\n        USDCurrency() {\n            name_ = \"American Dollar\";\n            code_ = \"USD\";\n        }\n    };\n\n\n    class SANPROJ_API CADCurrency : public Currency {\n    public:\n        CADCurrency() {\n            name_ = \"Canadian Dollar\";\n            code_ = \"CAD\";\n        }\n    };\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above classes form the contract of the DLL project. Now let's look at the client project files, which is a single class with <code>main</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"currency.hpp\"\n#include \"allccy.hpp\"\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing namespace SanProj;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    USDCurrency uccy;\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; uccy;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming all referencing/settings are already done in the Visual Studio project, I get the following error when trying to compile the client:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1&gt;testdll.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"__declspec(dllimport) public: __thiscall SanProj::USDCurrency::~USDCurrency(void)\" (__imp_??1USDCurrency@SanProj@@QAE@XZ)\n1&gt;testdll.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol \"__declspec(dllimport) public: __thiscall SanProj::USDCurrency::USDCurrency(void)\" (__imp_??0USDCurrency@SanProj@@QAE@XZ)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, this error goes away when I remove the <code>dllimport</code> part from the <code>SanProj.h</code> file and the executable is created.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what's the point of the IDE generated <code>dllimport</code> if we can't compile clients against the header?

These pages look for a standard master page in the root of the site, and thus work fine in each separate site with its respective branding.</p>\n\n<p>A few examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>/VacationCalendar</li>\n<li>/PhoneDir</li>\n<li>/Controls (.ascx files)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While it works okay in production, it sucks for a number of reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Copy Web Site tool sucks.</li>\n<li>You can't debug these components locally, since they don't actually exist in the site.</li>\n<li>The site isn't precompiled, which brings obvious performance issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So I'd like to throw out all that nonsense and switch to using precompiled sites, with a Web Deployment project putting everything in place on the server. This raises the problem of what to do about the shared components. I'm pretty sure I can't get away with the virtual directory trick in this kind of environment, and frankly, I don't really want to. </p>\n\n<p>How do I make a subdirectory of .aspx/.ascx files and associated image/script/CSS resources act sort of like a class library? Suppose I put everything that's in the VacationCalendar directory into its own project/solution, then have each intranet site import that and make all those files available under the /VacationCalendar path. Is there some way to do anything like that without major headaches?</p>\n\n<p>I don't really want to merge all these sites into a single solution, as there's always a possibility of needing to restrict access in source control.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio","keyboard-shortcuts","visual-studio-2012"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":93,"score":2,"question_id":12430498,"title":"What happened to Edit.MoveLineUp/Down in Visual Studio 2012","body":"<p>In Visual Studio 2010 you can assign keyboard shortcuts for moving lines up and down.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3GXnT.png\" alt=\"Visual Studio 2010\"></p>\n\n<p>I can't find these commands in 2012.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qC0Nx.png\" alt=\"Visual Studio 2012\"></p>\n\n<p>Have they been renamed or removed?

After whole day of trying to figure out a solution for linking libmysql.lib and mysqlclient.lib, I'm thoroughly done. So, there, I decided to take another way and use convenient MySQL connector.</p>\n\n<p>As 1.1.0 version of it uses boost, which I didn't have available and didn't want to take time and figure everything about, I decided to download 1.0.5.</p>\n\n<p>So, I installed it, created new project, linked all necessary libraries, set additional libraries and includes (well, generally, done everything according to <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/refman-5.5-en/connector-cpp-apps-windows-visual-studio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> manual. To test if it was working correctly, I used sample like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\n#include \"driver.h\"\n#include \"exception.h\"\n#include \"resultset.h\"\n#include \"statement.h\"\n#include \"prepared_statement.h\"\n\nint main(){\n\n    sql::Driver *driver;\n    sql::Connection *con;\n    sql::Statement *stmt;\n    sql::ResultSet *res;\n    sql::PreparedStatement *pstmt;\n\n    try{\n        driver = get_driver_instance();\n        con = driver-&gt;connect(\"localhost\", \"root\", \"root\");\n        con-&gt;setSchema(\"test\");\n\n        /*blah blah yada yada*/\n\n        }catch(sql::SQLException &amp;e){\n            std::cout&lt;&lt;e.what();\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I skipped part of the code, because it's not the point here. So, the problem with this was Application error telling about being unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Debugging didn't quite help, as this error occurred as soon as the program runs, i.e. even if I put infinite loop at the beginning, it still crashes.</p>\n\n<p>So, there I thought: \"It should be some bug of this version, so I have to try newer one\". After this I've gone ahead and downloaded version 1.1.0 of connector as well as boost libraries. Than created new project, set all dependencies just like with the first one, but pointing to the newer version of connector. Beside that, I've set new reference mysqlcppconn_EXPORTS. So, preparations were done and for testing purposes I've used code from <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-connector-cpp.html#createdb\" rel=\"nofollow\">MySQL site</a>, well, generally, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*tons of includes here*/\n\nint main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {\n\n    Driver *driver;\n    Connection *con;\n    Statement *stmt;\n    ResultSet *res;\n    PreparedStatement *prep_stmt;\n    Savepoint *savept;\n\n    int updatecount = 0;\n\n    /* initiate url, user, password and database variables */\n    string url(argc &gt;= 2 ? argv[1] : DBHOST);\n    const string user(argc &gt;= 3 ? argv[2] : USER);\n    const string password(argc &gt;= 4 ? argv[3] : PASSWORD);\n    const string database(argc &gt;= 5 ? argv[4] : DATABASE);\n\n    try {\n        driver = get_driver_instance();\n\n        /*blah blah yada yada*/\n\n    } catch (std::runtime_error &amp;e) {\n\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"ERROR: runtime_error in \" &lt;&lt; __FILE__;\n        //cout &lt;&lt; \" (\" &lt;&lt; __func__ &lt;&lt; \") on line \" &lt;&lt; __LINE__ &lt;&lt; endl;\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"ERROR: \" &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;\n\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n} // main()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And guess what?

Just to recap, WanIPConnection Service has 17 variables, so I've tried and logged all of them (with only 4 successful attempts, rest are runtime errors) and the WanPPPConnection Service (which is really similar to the WanIPConnection Service) but has a total of 19 state variables (just 2 more than WanIPConnection).

In visual studio 2008 you get an \"uninitialized local variable used\" warning at compile-time and get a run-time check failure at the point of access when debugging.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you access an uninitialized struct's member variable through one of its functions, you don't get any warnings or assertions.  Obviously the easiest solution is <em>don't do that</em>, but nobody's perfect.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct Test\n{\n    float GetMember() const { return member; }\n    float member;\n};\nTest test;\nfloat f1 = test.member;      // Raises warning, asserts in VS debugger at runtime\nfloat f2 = test.GetMember(); // No problem, just keeps on going\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This surprised me, but it makes some sense -- the compiler can't assume calling a function on an unused struct is an error, or how else would you initialize or construct it?  And anything fancier just quickly brings up so many other complications that it makes sense that it wouldn't bother classifying which functions are ok to call and when, especially just as a debugging help.  I know I can set up my own assertions or error checking within the class itself, but that can complicate some simpler structs.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it would seem like within the context of the function call, wouldn't it know insides <code>GetMember()</code> that <code>member</code> wasn't initialized yet?  I'm assuming it's not only relying on static compile-time deduction, given the <code>Run-Time Check Failure #3</code> it raises during execution, so based on my current understanding of it it would seem reasonable for the same checks to apply.  Is this just a limitation of this specific compiler/debugger (Visual Studio 2008), or more tied to how C++ works?</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","visual-studio","connection-string"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":258,"score":0,"question_id":12333850,"title":"Change My.Settings ConnectionString in runtime?","body":"<p>I have a ClickOnce deployment where i have a INI-settings file on the network file with \"global\" settings that is supposed to affect the program on all client computers.\nThe problem i have is that i whant to have the Database connectionString stored in this INI file and have it read and stored in the My.Settings ConnectionString at program startup.
