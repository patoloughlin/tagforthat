All these tests run fine in Visual Studio 2012. However, some of my tests fail in Visual Studio 2010. In these failing tests, I use <strong>Moq</strong> to mock several Interop Types from <code>Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel</code>. The test fails immediately when attempting to access these mocked interop types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: Missing method 'instance class Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range [ExcelAddIn.Core] Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListRow::get_Range()' from class 'Castle.Proxies.ListRowProxy'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This exception implies that I forgot to setup the appropriate property getter on my mock. Which is not the case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>_listRowMock.Setup(m =&gt; m.Range).Returns(_rangeMock.Object);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I can imagine that Moq might not work too well with Interop Types. But what I find most puzzling is that these tests run fine in Visual Studio 2012, but fail in Visual Studio 2010. </p>\n\n<p>Why is my Visual Studio influencing the behavior of my code?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 3-11-2012</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ok, so I got it down to this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have two projects; Core and Core.UnitTest. Core is the actual library while Core.UnitTest is a unit test project of the Core library.</li>\n<li>Both projects reference Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel with Embed Interop Types enabled.</li>\n<li>Because EIT is enabled, both projects include their own \"view\" of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library. The view includes all classes, methods and properties that are used in their respective project.</li>\n<li>Because both projects use different classes, methods and properties of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, the embedded types of both libraries differ. E.g. ListRow in Core has an Index and Range property, whereas ListRow in Core.UnitTest only has the Range property.</li>\n<li>Although both types are different and do not share a common interface or super class, they are <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997297.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">equivalent</a></strong>. This means that the CLR will treat them as if they are the same and will allow you to use these types across assembly boundaries. E.g. an instance of ListRow from Core.UnitTest will work fine when passed to a method in the Core library. The shared Range property will function, whereas the missing Index property will throw a MissingMethodException on access.</li>\n<li>The aforementioned behavior even works with mocked types. An mocked object of  Mock[Excel.ListRow] will work fine when crossing the assembly boundary.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, the behavior described in the previous point only works when I build my assemblies in Visual Studio <strong>2012</strong>. When I build my assemblies in Visual Studio <strong>2010</strong> and debug my code, I can see the mocked ListRow instance being passed into a method of my Core project. The moment the instance crosses the assembly boundary, all methods and properties of ListRow lose their implementation and throw MissingMethodExceptions.</li>\n<li>Now for the fun part, I actually managed to mitigate this issue by ensuring that both embedded types of ListRow are aligned. E.g. in order for the compiler to create the same view of ListRow in both projects, I made sure that I used the exact same methods and properties in my UnitTest project. This means adding dummy lines like: var dummy = listRow.Index. Once I had the compiler creating identical views of my embedded ListRow type, the instance was allowed to cross assembly boundaries without losing its implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The question still remains though: What causes this difference in behavior between Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012?</p>\n"},{"tags":["windows","visual-studio-2010","deployment"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13298440,"title":"Deploying Visual Studio 2010 .exe for WinXP","body":"<p>I'm working on a indie game and want it to run on windows xp, vista &amp; 7.

In an attempt to answer this question myself I have been learning C++/CLI the past few days/ weeks. </p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a number of different ways to achieve using a C# dll from unmanaged C++ and C. Some of the answers in brief appear to be: using Interlope services, Using .com. and regasm, Using PInvoke (which appears to go from C# to C++ only), and using IJW in the C++/CLR (which appears to be Interlope services). I am thinking it would be best to set up a library that is perhaps a CLR wrapper that uses IJW to call my C# dll on the behalf of native C++ and C code. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Specifics:</strong> I need to pass values of string as well as int to a C# dll from c++ code, and return void.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Many companies have many excuses to mix and match C++, C and C#. Performance: unmanaged code is usually faster, interfaces: Managed interfaces are generally easier to maintain, deploy, and are often easier on the eyes, Managers tell us too. Legacy code forces us too. It was there (Like the mountain that we climbed). While examples of how to call a C++ library from C# are abundant. Examples of how to call C# libraries from C++ code are difficult to find via Googling especially if you want to see updated 4.0+ code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software:</strong> C#, C++/CLR, C++, C, Visual Studio 2010, and .NET 4.0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question details:</strong> OK multi-part question:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there an advantage to using com objects? Or the PInvoke? Or some other method? (I feel like the learning curve here will be just as steep, even though I do find more information on the topic in Google Land. IJW seems to promise what I want it to do. Should I give up on looking for an IJW solution and focus on this instead?) (Advantage/ disadvantage?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Am I correct in imagining that there is a solution where I write a wrapper that that utilizes IJW in the C++/CLR? Where can I find more information on this topic, and don’t say I didn’t Google enough/ or look at MSDN without telling me where you saw it there. (I think I prefer this option, in the effort to write clear and simple code.)</p></li>\n<li><p>A narrowing of question scope: I feel that my true issue and need is answering the smaller question that follows: How do I set up a C++/CLR library that an unmanaged C++ file can use within visual studio. I think that if I could simply instantiate a managed C++ class in unmanaged C++ code, then I might be able work out the rest (interfacing and wrapping etc.). I expect that my main folly is in trying to set up references/#includes etc. within Visual Studio, thought clearly I could have other misconceptions. Perhaps the answer to this whole thing could be just a link to a tutorial or instructions that help me with this. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Research:</strong> I have Googled and Binged over and over with some success. I have found many links that show you how to use an unmanaged library from C# code. And I will admit that there have been some links that show how to do it using com objects. Not many results were targeted at VS 2010.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong>\nI have read over and over many posts. I have tried to work through the most relevant ones. Some seem tantalizingly close to the answer, but I just can’t seem to get them to work. I suspect that the thing that I am missing is tantalizingly small, such as misusing the keyword ref, or missing a #include or using statement, or a misuse of namespace, or not actually using the IJW feature properly, or missing a setting that VS needs to handle the compilation correctly, etc. So you wonder, why not include the code? Well I feel like I am not at a place where I understand and expect the code I have to work. I want to be in a place where I understand it, when I get there maybe then I'll need help fixing it. I'll randomly include two of the links but I am not permitted to show them all at my current Hitpoint level.</p>\n\n<p>This calls code from C++ (managed) to C++/CLR which is not what I want but I read it anyway: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/35437/Moving-Data-between-Managed-Code-and-Unmanaged-Cod\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/35437/Moving-Data-between-Managed-Code-and-Unmanaged-Cod</a> </p>\n\n<p>This calls code from managed and unmanaged code in both directions going from C++ to Visual Basic and back via C++CLR, and of course I am interested in C#.: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9903/Calling-Managed-Code-from-Unmanaged-Code-and-vice\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9903/Calling-Managed-Code-from-Unmanaged-Code-and-vice</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","visual-studio-2010","visual-studio","visual-studio-2012"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":1,"question_id":13273842,"title":"Code Contracts + Code Analysis","body":"<p>I think about starting to use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code Contracts</a> in my code base.</p>\n\n<p>I already use Code Analysis with all rules enabled and a goal of zero warnings.</p>\n\n<p>However, when using <code>Contract.Requires(parameter != null)</code> I get a warning from Code Analysis, namely CA1062:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CA1062 : Microsoft.Design : In externally visible method 'Foo', validate parameter 'parameter' before using it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's unfortunate, I don't want to disable that rule as I find it useful.

Only will a breakpoint be hit if I set it on the line after that, <code>xor eax, eax</code>, or any subsequent line.</p>\n\n<p>I have even tried inserting a software breakpoint, <code>int 3</code>, as the first line of the function, and it is also ignored.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I notice that is odd: viewing the disassembly after hitting one of my breakpoints gives me the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>01370FFF  add         byte ptr [ecx+6],bh  \n--- [Path]\\main.asm \n        xor eax, eax\n00841005  xor         eax,eax  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint is hit here\n_label: add eax, ecx\n00841007  add         eax,ecx  \n        dec ecx\n00841009  dec         ecx  \n        jnz _label\n0084100A  jne         _label (841007h)  \n        cmp eax, 21\n0084100C  cmp         eax,15h  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What's interesting here is that the <code>xor</code> is, in Visual Studio's eyes, the first operation in my program.  Absent is the line <code>move ecx, 6</code>.  Directly above where it thinks my source begins is the line that actually sets <code>ecx</code> to 6.  So the actual start of my program has been mangled according to the disassembly.</p>\n\n<p>If I make the first line of my program <code>int 3</code>, the line that appears above where my code is in the disassembly is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00F80FFF  add         ah,cl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As suggested in one of the answers, I turned off ASLR, and it looks like the disassembly is a little more stable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.CODE\nmain PROC\n        ;mov ecx, 6\n        xor eax, eax\n00401000  xor         eax,eax  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint is present here, but not hit.\n_label: add eax, ecx\n00401002  add         eax,ecx  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint here is hit.\n        dec ecx\n00401004  dec         ecx  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The complete program is visible in the disassembly, but the problem still perists.  Despite my program starting on an expected address, <strong>and</strong> the first breakpoint being shown in the disassembly, it is still skipped.  Placing an <code>int 3</code> as the first line still results in the following line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00400FFF  add         ah,cl  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and does not stop execution, <em>and</em> re-mangles the view of my program in the disassembly again.  The next line of my program is then at location <code>00401001</code>, which I suppose makes sense because <code>int 3</code> is a one-byte instruction, but why would it have disappeared in the disassembly?</p>\n\n<p>Even starting the program using the 'Step Into (F11)' command does not allow me to break on the first line.  In fact, with no breakpoint, starting the program with F11 does not halt execution at all.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","visual-c++","linker"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":456,"score":0,"question_id":10847076,"title":"How do I add a lib file to link in Visual C++ 2010?","body":"<p>I've found the Additional Dependencies thing on Visual C++ 2010, but I can't seem to find any option of adding new .lib files when I go to .\nI need to add wsock32.lib to link with my file, how do I make it happen?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","universe","u2netdk"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":0,"question_id":12093571,"title":"U2NETDK VisualStudio 2010 add-in","body":"<p>Is there any Visual Studio 2010 add-in available for Rocket U2 .NET Database Provider (Universe)?

I have installed MySQL Connector C++ from the MySQL website (the msi installer). NOTE: I have not done anything with the Connector install except run the exe I downloaded. Didn't think I needed to compile anything, but I'm wrong a lot. I have created a database, a user who has privileges to the database, and this user can (in theory) connect from any ip, because it is declared as 'username@'%'. I also changed the my.cnf file so that the bind-address line is commented out. I used 'mysqladmin ping -h serveraddress -u username -p' and that gave me 'mysqld is alive', so I'm assuming the database is accessible from any ip remotely. So, I opened up VS 2010 Pro, made a new project, went to tools, and then 'Connect To Database'. I selected Microsoft MySQL Server and put in the information exactly as I did for mysqladmin. I clicked Test Connection and I get an error box that ends with 'provider: Named Pipes Provider, error 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server'. Sorry for the block of text, just want to give all the details I can.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully I'm close to making this work, I'm not pressed for time but I'm really tired of not being able to work on anything else in the project, since it all branches from this database connection.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks you all!

Like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class UserControl1 : UserControl\n{\n    private Collection&lt;Class1> field = null;\n    // later changed to:\n    //private Collection&lt;Class1> field = new Collection&lt;Class1>();\n    [Category(\"Data\")]\n    [DefaultValue(null)]\n    [Description(\"asdf\")]\n    public Collection&lt;Class1> prop\n    {\n        get { return field; }\n        set { field = value; }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>// later added:\n//[Serializable]\npublic class Class1\n{\n    private bool booltest; public bool Booltest { get...set...}\n    private int inttest; public int Inttest { get...set...}\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>If you already know what I screwed up: no need to read the rest.</b> I am going to describe what exactly I did.</p>\n\n<p>Now I put the <code>UserControl</code> onto a random Form and change the <code>Prop</code> property. A generic \"Collection Editor\" appears, like the one used for the columns and groups in a listview control. I can enter data as expected. However, when I click OK, the data is gone.</p>\n\n<p>It took me over hour to figure out that I actually have to instantiate my field: <code>private Collection&lt;MyClass&gt; field = new Collection&lt;MyClass&gt;();</code>. Very good, only that the designer entered superspazzing mode. Cascading nightmare error message that can be reduced to: \"You must put <code>[Serializable]</code> before your <code>Class1</code>.\" After doing that I could actually put my <code>UserControl1</code> on the Form again.</p>\n\n<p>But that only works once. When opening the designer of the Form where I use the <code>UserControl1</code> after editing something, it gives me an error:</p>\n\n<p><code>Object of type 'userctltest.Class1[]' cannot be converted to type 'userctltest.Class1[]'.</code></p>\n\n<p>Well. The Error List says:</p>\n\n<p><code>Warning: ResX file Object of type 'userctltest.Class1[]' cannot be converted to type 'userctltest.Class1[]'. Line 134, position 5. cannot be parsed.</code></p>\n\n<p>The designer tries to fetch the Property's data from the resx file. Removing the resx file \"solves\" that exactly once.</p>\n\n<p>The Form can now be displayed again, with my <code>UserControl1</code>. The Collection property <em>is</em> editable, and it is being saved. It actually works. Once. Whenever I change something and then try to open the Form's designer again, the above error occurs again. I can delete the resx file, but that will of course also delete my data.</p>\n\n<p>Relevant resources that helped me so far (among a ton of not so helpful search results):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Answers/190675/Usercontrol-with-custom-class-property#answer1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Answers/190675/Usercontrol-with-custom-class-property#answer1</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/propertyeditor.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/propertyeditor.aspx</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.csharpfriends.com/Articles/getArticle.aspx?articleID=94\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.csharpfriends.com/Articles/getArticle.aspx?articleID=94</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.iserializable.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.iserializable.aspx</a><br></p>\n\n<p>(I also tried implementing ISerializable and overriding GetObjectData with</p>\n\n<p><code>{ info.AddValue(\"testbool\", testbool); info.AddValue(\"testint\", testint); }</code></p>\n\n<p>didn't help either (I also tried the property names instead of the field names))</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for writing this like a bad horror novel btw.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","visual-studio-2010","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":13,"score":-1,"question_id":13277044,"title":"Entity Framework database not showing","body":"<p>When I select 'add a new item' and then select 'ADO.NET Entity Data Model' and select 'Generate from database' in Visual Studio only some databases show up but other databases I have added don't?

This new laptop is pretty high-end: Win 7 x64, i7 processor, 16G memory, 2G Video Memory (I am going to mainly use it for CAD), so I thought the slowdown couldn't possibly be hardware-related. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to open up Window's Resource Monitor to the side of the screen and try to do some work in VS2010. What I saw was that my CPU usage stayed reasonable (&lt;20%), but the CPU Maximum Frequency pegged at 108% and stayed there until I stopped using the IDE. Once the Max Frequency came back down, the IDE immediately became responsive again. To isolate this problem to VS2010, I launched a few more applications (CAD, FEA, etc) and kept an eye on the Resource Monitor - everything was smooth and the Max Frequency did not peg, rather it fluctuated normally as you would expect.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are: Does this observation mean that the hardware (CPU) is not able to keep up with the software (VS2010)? Are there any tricks I might be able to try to correct this issue? The laptop I was using had a Centrino Duo running Win 7 x64 and seemed to have no problems. </p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","crystal-reports"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":6,"score":0,"question_id":13275445,"title":"Crystal Report not updating after upgrade to VS2010","body":"<p>I opened my old version Crystal Report (supposingly Visual Studio 2008 as it is a hand over project, I have no clear details about that) with Visual Studio 2010 and start adding new data and columns etc for example \"Work Order\".

All of a sudden, I'm getting this error in the design view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Invalid URI: The Authority/Host could not be parsed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Design view is completely frozen and won't let me do anything.  However, the program still compiles just fine, background image and all.  But obviously I can't continue my work on the program without the Design view.  How can I fix this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, in case someone asks, this program has not been changed AT ALL in between working on my old computer and not working on my new computer.  However, the version of VS2010 has changed from Premium to Ultimate, if that makes a difference.</p>\n\n<p>SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  I deleted the offending line of XAML code and attempted to re-add the background image to the window via the Design view (the Properties editor).  Everything works fine so long as the background is set to a solid color, but as soon as I click on the button to set an image as the background, before it even lets me pick an image, I get an error that says the property's value is not valid, referencing the same Invalid URI error as before.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","visual-studio-2010","app-config"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":11684940,"title":"Is it possible for <appSettings /> to contain settings AND refer to another <appSettings /> section in a different file?","body":"<p>Is it possible for me to have an <code>&lt;appSettings /&gt;</code> section in my app.config which contains a number of settings, but which also references an <code>&lt;appSettings /&gt;</code> section in a different file?</p>\n\n<p>This would allow me to keep config options that only the developer should be interested in, e.g. options to show debug output on the main window (very messy but useful to me) or to save certain files to specific locations.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this is what I'm trying to achieve:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- this is the appSettings section of the normal app.config file,\n     which also contains everything else that app.config would --&gt;\n&lt;appSettings configSource=\"AppSettings.config\"&gt; &lt;!-- references another file --&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"deployment_config_option1\" value=\"1\"/&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"deployment_config_option2\" value=\"2\"/&gt;\n&lt;/appSettings&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- this a new appSettings section of another file called DevSettings.Config\n     which only contains settings us developers are interested in\n     by keeping these settings in a different file, \n     I can ensure it's never deployed --&gt;\n&lt;appSettings&gt; &lt;!-- references another file --&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"show_debug_on_screen\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"save_copy_to_desktop\" value=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/appSettings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-2010","cpp-netlib"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13240295,"title":"cpp-netlib http response throws thread exception","body":"<p>I am using visual studio and cpp-netlib for my project and I have a function like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace http = boost::network::http;\nhttp::client::response make_get_request(const string&amp; uri) {\n  http::client client;\n  http::client::request request = make_request_header(uri);  // my custom function\n  http::client::response response = client.get(request);\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; response.body() &lt;&lt; std::endl;  // THIS LINE IS THE DEAL BREAKER\n  return response;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I comment out the cout line and return the response directly, it throws me an error unrelated to the cose, but somewhere in the thread library.

We've added new framework versions and used new versions of VS as time goes on, but we've never upgraded the Crystal version. With the simplicity of installing the Crystal 13 that comes with VS2010, however, I persuaded my boss to take a chance on upgrading our apps as we roll out fixes/updates to them. I converted an app from VS2005 and its reports to Crystal 13, installed framework 4.0 and Crystal 13 on our dev server, and all looked good. Then installed same on UAT, and all still looked good. Before I rolled it out to production, however, I had to make some changes to another very large app in a short enough timeframe that I could not upgrade it to VS2010/Crystal 13. Now I can't run the 9.1 Crystal reports on the large app in dev, and I'm afraid to move it to UAT if I can't even run them in dev. The most annoying part is that I'm not even getting an error message - it just doesn't work. I don't <em>know</em> that the addition of Crystal 13 caused the issue, but I made no changes to the report generation in this release and have no other explanation.</p>\n\n<p>The details:\nVS 2008 app with a 9.1 Crystal Report created in the application and exported to a pdf file on local server. I get no errors, but no pdf file ever gets exported or saved. I have confirmed that the user id running the application pool has access to the folder where it should be saved. I have confirmed that creating the report in preview mode in VS2008 and then exporting it from the preview window to that same folder does work. I found several references to running 10.5 with 13, but nothing about 9.1 with 13, and what they mentioned for 10.5 does not seem to apply to 9.1. The servers are running Windows Server 2003 SP2.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone successfully used Crystal 9.1 and Crystal 13 on the same server? I'm running out of time, year-end freeze is almost upon us, so I have to get these fixes out before (including running them through QA and UAT) early November or they get delayed to late January and that will NOT make my boss happy.</p>\n\n<p>Any and all help greatly appreciated!

That is, it must do <code>#include \"Classname.cpp\"</code> instead of the usual <code>#include \"Classname.h\"</code> The rule is in effect the rest of this book. Because the main implementation file does a #include of the class implementation code, the class implementation code is not compiled separately.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":13222212,"title":"Create object before main is called","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a project and I'm a bit stumped.

The solution is unfortunately under that laughably called source control, tfs.</p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to be that when any of the installers build, the project file for the installers gets touched by the compiler. It either tries to delete and recreate it or at least edit it. TFS complains about this action and we get maybe up to 30 error popups. They say:</p>\n\n<p>\"The command you are attempting cannot be completed because the file [filename] is under source code control and not checked out.\"</p>\n\n<p>If you click ok on all of them, everything builds just fine. And of course, if I checkout the installer project files each and every time I want to build, I don't get the popups. That's not a viable solution. I suppose I could change it so the installers do not get built each and every time someone tries to build the whole solution. Which technically, that's really the way I should have it configured. Or put the installers in their own solution. This would reduce the annoyance factor for every build, but that doesn't solve the overall problem. There has to be some configuration that builds everything without the popups. Or lack of that, the installers are always going to be in source control no matter what solution they are in and how frequently they get built. The above error must go or I must choose an alternative installer project type.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1114,"score":0,"question_id":3242279,"title":"What is that little padlock symbol right near every visual studio tab?","body":"<p>since some days I have on the right side of any visual studio tab a little padlock symbol.

Only having little experience with C++, I chose Visual Studio as IDE, updated with SP1. I got the solution to build relatively easily and wanted to navigate the code a little to get an overview.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I noticed that sometimes \"Go to Definition\"/\"Go to declaration\" doesn't work. Both options are available when I right-click on a symbol in the source code, but when I'm in the header file, \"Go to Definition\" only takes me to the declaration again for those functions that are concerned. And when I'm in the .cc file, I always get taken to the definition in the same file.</p>\n\n<p>Some more things I've noticed about the functions which are concerned by this are:</p>\n\n<p>1) for some functions, I can navigate to the definition from the header file, but the other direction is broken</p>\n\n<p>2) navigation for some functions can be fixed if the declaration is changed to completely match the definition, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>header declaration:\n    void buche(sint64 betrag, player_cost type);\nsource definition:\n    void karte_t::buche(sint64 const betrag, player_cost const type)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>change to</p>\n\n<pre><code>header declaration:\n    void buche(sint64 const betrag, player_cost const type);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-> navigation works in both directions</p>\n\n<p>3) when clicking into a code block of a concerned function in the source file, the scope menu at the top changes to \"(Global Scope)\" instead of showing the little arrow to the right (which is the symbol for a forward declaration I think?) and the class name (but those functions are definitely class members)</p>\n\n<p>I've searched around a lot and this seems to be a relatively well-known problem. There's a thread here on the site: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39474/how-to-get-intellisense-to-reliably-work-in-visual-studio-2008\">How to get intellisense to reliably work in Visual Studio 2008</a></p>\n\n<p>I also found several threads on the Microsoft forums (which I can't link as I'm only allowed to post two hyperlinks), but no official confirmation of a bug or something.</p>\n\n<p>The quintessence of the replies I found is that one should delete the .ncb file (which has been superseded by an .sdf database in VS2010 as I understand it), or use the option to rebuild the database on loading the solution. I did all of that multiple times, to no avail. The highest rated reply on the thread here on Stackoverflow seems to implicate that this is simply a bug (of Intellisense - did I get it right that it's this autocomplete component which is also responsible for the code navigation?) one has to accept, suggesting to use <a href=\"http://www.wholetomato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual Assist</a> instead, however the question was about VS2008 then and one reply pointed to VS2010 improving on this. Another reply blamed recursive references, but I -think- this is not a problem in this project as all the files (certainly those few I've checked and encountered the problems with) have include guards. It has also been confirmed to me by one coder of that project that he has the same problems. But I'm not so keen on spending money on Visual Assist, it's only meant to be a little hobby ...</p>\n\n<p>Having a lot of experience with Eclipse/Java, it just seems weird to me that such a relatively essential feature of an IDE doesn't work reliably. Of course I can understand that static code analysis is much more difficult for C++ than for Java.

Suppose I have this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Helpers\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" /&gt;\n      &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"1.0.0.0-2.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"2.0.0.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" /&gt;\n      &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"1.0.0.0-4.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"4.0.0.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose I want to completely erase the <code>dependentAssembly</code> node, and its children, that matches the xpath <code>//runtime/assemblyBinding/dependentAssembly[assemblyIdentity@name='System.Web.Mvc']</code>.  To do that, I might want something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity \n          name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" \n          xdt:Remove \n          xdt:Locator=\"Condition(..[*@name=$name])\" \n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well obviously I made up the syntax <code>@name=$name</code> based on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/wiki/Variables_in_XPath\" rel=\"nofollow\">xpath variable concepts</a>, but this example demonstrates why I'd want that feature.  Is this supported?  How must I adjust my syntax to take advantage of this?  I could put in a string literal, but I just want to know if this is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another way I might try to delete the <code>dependentAssembly</code> node, is with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" xdt:Transform=\"Remove\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" xdt:Locator=\"Match(name)\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the <code>Transform</code> is on a grand-parent node, and the locator is on leaf node. Is the above legitimate?  The idea is to remove only the <code>dependantAssembly</code> node that has an internal Locator Match.</p>\n\n<p>These two approaches aside, how would you go about deleting the targeting <code>dependantAssembly</code> and all its child nodes?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":13150343,"title":"The constant cannot be marked static","body":"<p>I am trying to declare a PI constant like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static const double PI = Math.PI;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but why am I getting this error?</p>\n\n<pre><code>The constant 'Calendar.NewCalendar.PI' cannot be marked static\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","qt-vs-addin"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":11941885,"title":"moc-ed files being exluded from build in Visual Studio 2010","body":"<p>I have a VS2010 solution with couple of Qt-based projects.

When the user clicks on this link, the report is exported to Word and displayed as an editable word 2003 document.  Our users are able to modify this document and type additional information at the bottom before sending it to the client.</p>\n\n<p>We migrated this report to Crystal Reports 10.2 that comes with Visual Studio 2005 and since in this version of CR, all report items are placed in text boxes, the formatting is quite different from the original and where users used to type at the bottom, there is a small textbox that limits their ability to type freely.  Also font sizes are reduced by half a size and both report headers and footers end up outside of Word header and footer sections. We spoke to CR support and they asked us to apply a service pack and try Visual Studio 2010 which we did with no luck.</p>\n\n<p>Next we tried SSRS reports with our SQL Server 2005 and found out that this version does not support export to Word so we installed the free SQL Server 2008 Express with Advanced options that offers SSRS.  However another interesting fact we found was that Visual Studio 2005 does not support report projects so we moved the projects to BIDS that comes with SQL Server 2008 Express.  Anyhow, similar to CR, SSRS also places all report items in text boxes and changes all our original formatting when exported to Word 2003.  It also leaves some bits and pieces of borders of tables and textboxes visible on the document.  The header and footer do end up in Word header and footers unlike CR but the margins are not the same as when they were created in SSRS.  We also tried Word 2010 and had a similar experience.</p>\n\n<p>Next we tried to do the report in Word itself directly.  We installed Visual Studio office tools second edition over our Visual Studio 2005 professional edition and that only gave us the AddIn creation capability and not document projects.  Apparently at some point Microsoft provided Visual Studio Office tools for sale that had that option but it is no longer available.  Our next option was Visual Studio 2010 office tools but that version does not support Word 2003, only 2007 and 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Our requirement is to have a link to a dynamic report on our web site with some of the data coming from the database when the link is clicked and displayed in an editable Word 2003 document allowing the user to modify the information and in particular add more data at the end of the document without changing any formatting of the document or placement of logos.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate any ideas on what the best way is to achieve this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-2010","oop","object","member-function-pointers"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":1,"question_id":13130451,"title":"C++ Call Member Function Within An Object of an Object","body":"<p>I have a C++ class which, in short, has a declaration which looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Pico {\n  ...\n  Document document; // Custom Document class\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Later I call one of the public member functions of the <code>Document</code> class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this-&gt;document-&gt;enableEditing();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, IntelliSense underlines <code>this</code> and notes that \"expression must have pointer type\".

Also checked Text Editor->HTML for the same settings)</p>\n\n<p>Reset my settings and checked them again</p>\n\n<p>Tried running visual studio as an admin</p>\n\n<p>Tried running visual studio in safe mode ([Windows 7] Start button->All Programs->Microsoft Visual Studio 2010->Visual Studio Tools->Visual Studio Command Prompt-> typed: devenv.exe /SafeMode)</p>\n\n<p>Deleted C:\\Users[UserName]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0\\ReflectedSchemas</p>\n\n<p>Deleted C:\\Users[UserName]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0</p>\n\n<p>Tried devenv.exe /resetuserdata in the visual studio command prompt</p>\n\n<p>Installed Service Pack 1</p>\n\n<p>Uninstalled and reinstalled Visual Studio 2010</p>\n\n<p>The problem still persisted after each of those. Today though, one of my coworkers ran into the same problem with Intellisense not working for asp tags in that same project (after getting the latest version).

I have a class CChannel which stores geometry of the duct, CFlow which holds global properties of the fluid and CNode which stores local parameters of the boundary layer.\nWhen I execute the program in the current form the first element of the GridPoints vector (variable \"alpha\") inside CChannel is assigned the same memory location as Uinf which is a private member of the CFlow class. When I change the latter class so that the fields it holds are no longer pointers but regular variables the problem disappears.

When I was searching for the answer I found that this may have been caused by the in-built code optimiser but didn't manage to learn anything else.

Otherwise, I guess my shutdown process will have to be a LOT more thorough with resetting all the visual elements. Registry values seem to ignore, override, or bypass my startup code.

Only one question remains, which is why the debugger did not find this error.  </p>\n\n<p>The Silverlight App I'm working on is a secure app maintaining customer information in the form of document-like system. You open a client document and you can manipulate the client data. It has a large server-side park for storing the documents and all changes and it's huge. (Over 40 projects within the solution.)  </p>\n\n<p>I'm working on this app together with two other developers. We've adjusted all kinds of code for over a week but did not notice that an error started to occur because we run the app with a debugger active. (We should have tested it outside the debugger but we all forgot this, apparently.)<br>\nToday, I tried to start the app without debugger and I could log in, but after trying to open a client document, it crashed, and crashed hard! Black Screen of Death in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer just restarts. Firefox and other browsers go down too. No indication of where the error is located.<br>\nOkay, repeating it with the debugger active and the App is well-behaved again. No crashes, nothing. It works just as we'd expect it to work.  </p>\n\n<p>After using our source control system to find the moment in time when the bug was introduced, we finally did manage to discover when it was introduced, which helped us to find the cause of the problem. As it turned out, a bound property would raise a PropertyChanged event on several other properties. But those others would also raise more PropertyChanged events on more properties and somehow, this created an eternal loop of raised events. All this because a change was made to a single property.<br>\nThis means the problem is solved, but does not explain why the code would work just fine in the debugger, while it also crashes fatally without the debugger.

I've done a proof of concept and it works great. Basically I isolate a solution (sln) as a team project (and all the projects that go with it), and then I have another team project that's the common files (dlls or other sln project from the outsides).

Must I believe that it is impossible to have 2 projects with threads doing Debug.WriteLine at the same time ?</p>\n\n<p>Once again, I am in deperate need of a way to fix this and still get Debug Output.\nOh, and I have also tried the option of redirecting output to the immediate window with no success either.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":921,"score":2,"question_id":5992094,"title":"Debug.Writeline stops working","body":"<p>We have a solution with multiple projects after running the code from VS the output normally seen from Debug.Writeline statements just cease to appear.

They all have set up their own C# projects and solutions with configuration settings specific to their own needs. However, now we need to create another, global solution, which will combine and build all projects into the same output directory. The problem that I have encountered though, is that I have found only one way to make all projects build into the same output directory - I need to modify configurations for all of them. That is what we would like to avoid. We would prefer that all these projects had no knowledge about this \"global\" solution. Each team must retain possibility to work just with their own sub-solution. One possible workaround is to create a special configuration for all projects just for this \"global\" solution, but that could create extra problems since now you have to constantly sync this configuration settings with the regular one, used by that specific team. Last thing we want to do is to spend hours trying to figure out why something doesn't work when building under global solution just because of some check box that developers have checked in their configuration, but forgot to do so in the global configuration.\nSo, to simplify, we need some sort of output directory setting or post build event that would only be present when building from that global, all-inclusive solution. Is there any way to achieve this without changing something in projects configurations?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>\nSome extra details I guess I need to mention:<br>\nWe need this global solution to be as close as possible to what the end user gets when he installs our application, since we intend to use it for debugging of the entire application when we need to figure out which part of the application isn't working before sending this bug to the team working on that part. This means that when building under global solution the output directory hierarchy should be the same as it would be in Program Files after installation, so that if, for example, we have Program Files/MyApplication/Addins folder which contains all the addins developed by different teams, we need the global solution to copy the binaries from addins projects and place them in the output directory accordingly. The thing is, the team developing an addin doest necessary know that it is an addin and that it should be placed in that folder, so they cannot change their relative output directory to be build/bin/Debug/Addins.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","performance","stackframe"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13006371,"title":"Does omitting the frame pointers really have a positive effect on performance and a negative effect on debug-ability?","body":"<p>As was advised long time ago, I always build my release executables without frame pointers (which is the default if you compile with /Ox).</p>\n\n<p>However, now I read in the paper <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=81176\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=81176</a>, that frame pointers don't have much of an effect on performance.

I don't need to 'design' anything on it and actually its height is set to 0).</p>\n\n<p>Everything works as intended at run time, but at design time, it seems like whenever I open the child control in Design mode to work on it, Visual Studio keeps increasing the width on me, by perhaps a couple hundred pixels at a time (or possibly some factor).  Before I know it, the thing is 10,000 plus pixels wide and then I have to reset the width in the designer just so it is manageable.  This isn't an issue at run time, because the controls width gets set by a parent container it is put in, and the control is anchored to the parent.  Its just a pain while designing the controls.  Here's just little snippets to better explain what I've done:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class BaseRow : UserControl\n{\n    public BaseRow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n\n        ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I want to actually create controls that inherit from this BaseRow, but that I can edit in the designer.  So, I go to Add -> UserControl.  Then in the class code I change the default created code to inherit from my BaseRow (which inherits from UserControl) so it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// changed the inheritance below from UserControl to BaseRow (which inherits from UserControl)\npublic partial class UnitRow : BaseRow\n{\n    public UnitRow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I originally set the width of the objects to 400 in both the base class and the child class in the designer.  The base Row sets its Anchor property in its constructor:</p>\n\n<p><code>this.Anchor = AnchorStyles.Top | AnchorStyles.Left | AnchorStyles.Right;</code></p>\n\n<p>because these controls will all go in a subclassed panel control that will control the width of rows that are added to it.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works fine at run time.  The actual width of these 'Row' controls I have created is set correctly and changes appropriately based on its parent subclassed panel control.  But when I open the row controls in design mode at design time, the width is constantly getting longer and longer.  Everytime the width equal 10,000 or more I manually change it back in the Properties window to a width of 400.</p>\n\n<p>Its not causing any major issue.  But it is a real pain.

The other reason they quoted was that since they were able to get the Full Install version of the .NET Framework 4.5 down to 50 MB's, that also reduced the need of creating a Client Profile version (since .NET 4.5 Full Install is only 9 MB's greater than the .NET 4.0 Client Profile), and only 1. MB's greater than the equivalent Full Install (Standalone Offline Installer).</p>\n\n<p>Now, my question really just has two parts, as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1). How on earth (excuse my enthusiasm) how can the 3.5 and below (3.0, 2.0) versions be several hundred MB's in size, when the 4.0 &amp; 4.5 versions have fixed so many issues in 3.5 and below, and have added so many features since 3.5 and below, while being several times smaller in packaged size?</p>\n\n<p>2). Is this the final word on the Client Profile, or may we see one for .NET 4.5 someday?</p>\n\n<p>3).

Users of the application can add video and images to the timeline and select a song to play in the background.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate goal is to render the timeline contents (ds graph contents) to a wmv based file.

There is no exception, cpu usage simply drops to 0 and nothing happens. It's difficult to debug since I access DirectShow through DirectShow.NET and I don't know what is happening behind the scenes.

Either way, the output directory hierarchy seems fine and the VSTO refers to the proper path in the hierarchy for the relevant dlls.

I then have to move the dividers back where I want them - one right between the screens and one halfway across the larger screen.  Then when I stop the program, it resets them AGAIN, and I have to constantly repeat this process, which is not only really annoying, but also slow and unresponsive when dealing with the very large code-base I'm currently working on.  Is there some way to tell VS to just leave my window positioning alone between running and stopping execution?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","visual-studio-2010","data-binding"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":98,"score":2,"question_id":12753603,"title":"Calling OnPropertyChange(\"property_name\") Sends Updates to All Bound Properties","body":"<p>So I have a class with 40 or so properties that are updated from communication with a micro controller.

Now it doesn't actually trigger the <code>Application_Start</code> method - but when you have WebActivator in the project as well, any of its pre-application-start methods <strong><em>are</em></strong> triggered.</p>\n\n<p>In my case this is causing huge issues - high CPU usage and memory usage in <code>devenv.exe</code> (equivalent to the website having just been started) because I initialise DI containers and god-knows what else at this point, but one in particular is proving <em>really</em> annoying.</p>\n\n<p>My website has a component that listens on the network for status and cache-invalidation messages from other machines in the web farm.  In QA and Live environments this listener never fails to open the port and listen - on my dev machine, however, it frequently fails - saying the port's already in use.  When I look for the process that's holding it open - it's always <code>devenv.exe</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You guessed it - I start this listener in a WebActivator-initialised boot-strapping call.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is - does anyone know of a way to detect that the code <em>isn't</em> being run by a 'proper' web host so I can stop it being run?  I'm particularly hopeful for this as it'll also mean that my Visual Studio and Razor editing experience will become a damn-site faster as a result!</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, any fix could legitimately be sent to David Ebbo - author of WebActivator - so he can stick it earlier in his stack to prevent the problem completely!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wpf","visual-studio-2010","localization","internationalization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":0,"question_id":12862407,"title":"I18N C# Application","body":"<p>I got a C# application, and I want to I18N it.

They are files generated during compilation, and it would be akin to including the 'bin' folder in the TFS (including the problems it would cause). Maybe we should create the min files in a different folder and treat it like 'bin'?

The code for the <code>AddNewItem</code> button is the default code generated by VB itself (I do not know how to access this code, double clicking it will just generate an empty sub procedure for the click event-- I am new to VB).  I have not written any subsequent code for it.  The binding navigator toolbar and the <code>AddNewItem</code> button was generated by dragging the \"Details\" of a table in the Data Sources window onto the form.

Once they do so, a formatting issue occurs where the masked text box will delete the first 0.  For example, if the user types \"08/20/1997\" in the \"Birth Date\" masked text box, it will change it to \"82/01/997_\" after clicking out of the text box.  The same thing happens for all other masked text boxes and their associated masks.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that this only happens <strong>after</strong> the user has clicked <code>AddNewItem</code>.  If you were to open the form and enter a data without clicking it, the masked text box accepts the 0's just fine.  But once the user hits the \"AddNewItem\" button, the masked text box will delete the first 0 out of the data once they make the cursor leave the masked text box.  </p>\n\n<p>I've tried recreating the form with no luck, and even started the entire project over from scratch to have the same thing happen again.

I know because the errors I get are identical of those I was getting when I set the app pool to work on .net 4.0 prior the .net 4.5 install. </p>\n\n<p>So how can I force the VS2010 and the compiler to target .net 3.5 and not .net 4.0 when I have all the web.config suggested by MS entries as well as the app pool is set to 2.0?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>PS. What I mean by web.config legacy &amp; startup:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy=\"true\"&gt;\n    &lt;supportedRuntime version=\"v3.5.30729.1\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/startup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have the compiler section as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;compilers&gt;\n    &lt;compiler language=\"c#;cs;csharp\" extension=\".cs\" type=\"Microsoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider, System, Version=3.5.30729.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\" warningLevel=\"4\"&gt;\n      &lt;providerOption name=\"CompilerVersion\" value=\"v3.5\"/&gt;\n      &lt;providerOption name=\"OptionInfer\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n      &lt;providerOption name=\"WarnAsError\" value=\"false\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/compiler&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Any framework combination with the web.config section bellow makes no difference.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;startup&gt;\n&lt;supportedRuntime version=\"v2.0.50727\"/&gt;\n&lt;supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\"/&gt;\n&lt;/startup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Attempting to repair VS2010 does not help, uninstalling .net 4.5 and installing back .net 4.0 works as expected and VS2010 compiles with no issues and most importantly NO CHANGES to any part of the project/IIS etc. So the install of .net 4.5 framework is somehow the issue. At this point I have tried everything I could find on the \"internets\" as far as modifications to the web.config etc.</p>\n\n<p>Still no light at the end of the tunnel...</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","reactive-extensions-js"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":2,"question_id":12222385,"title":"Can't find assembly - System.Reactive.Debugger","body":"<p>I have installed visual studio 2010 express and then Reactive Extensions 2.0.

(Visual Studio 2010)","body":"<p>Hello fellow programmers!</p>\n\n<p>This is a question towards  programmers who have experience with using Visual Studio 2010 for debugging external applications.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I'm developping an add-on for a program made by people I work for. In order to make this add-on work with the external program, I have to place the .dll file in a certain folder, specified by the external program. I have my build settings configurated so the .dll file is copied automatically. I also copy the .pdb file to enable debugging options.</p>\n\n<p>Since this add-on is nothing but a class library, I can't debug it like I normally would. I also don't have the source code for the external application. How should I debug this class library properly?</p>\n\n<p>This is what I tried:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Attach to Process</strong><br>\nSee <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6wf8e4z.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attach to a Running Process</a>. This seems to work fine, except it takes a few seconds to set up. That's a problem, because most of the exceptions/breakpoints occur at the very first seconds of the start of the external program. It also becomes annoying to manually attach Visual Studio to a process, because I debug this class library a lot, thus taking a lot of time after a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Debugger.Launch()</strong><br>\nCurrently I use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debugger.launch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debugger.Launch()</a> to attach Visual Studio to the external program. This will display a Just In Time prompt, asking me which instance of Visual Studio I would like to use. I find this to be much slower than \"Attach to Process\", but this way I am sure that the debugger is attached before any breakpoints can occur. Placing this between <code>#if DEBUG</code> and <code>#end if</code> makes sure this popup doesn't show when I create a release build, which helps too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Add as Existing Project</strong><br>\nI've added the executable of the program as a project to my solution. By doing this I can set this executable as startup project, and pressing F5 will start it. The biggest advantage of this, is that I can now debug the executable as soon at is it is started. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0bxe8ytt.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug an Executable Not Part of a Visual Studio Solution</a>. With this, Visual Studio breaks at exceptions, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to load the breakpoints. The following information is shown when I try using breakpoints:\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5itdQ.png\" alt=\"breakpoint\">\nThe modules window displays: \"Binary was not built with debug information.\". Can this be solved?</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Start Action</strong><br>\nSilentDoc noted that I can also set an external program as start action, using Properties -> Debug -> Start Action. See: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/68c8335t.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Change the Start Action for Application Debugging</a> It appears to load the breakpoints correctly this way. However, for some reason this makes the external program freeze for <strong>5 minutes</strong> at the first breakpoint/exception encountered. After it is done freezing, things seem to work as expected. What could cause this freeze?</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Image File Execution Options</strong><br>\nAs hmemcpy suggested, I can also use \"Image File Execution Options\" for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a329t4ed.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launching the Debugger Automatically</a>. This seems to be the same as Debugger.Launch(), since it displays the same Just In Time prompt. However, this Just In Time \"debugger\" doesn't debug at all: breakpoints and exceptions are ignored. Also, when working with a release build, I can't simply disable the Just In Time prompt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nOption 1 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but takes too much time.<br>\nOption 2 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpoints/exceptions, but is too slow.<br>\nOption 3 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.<br>\nOption 4 loads breakpoints, but freezes for 5 minutes at first breakpoint/exception.<br>\nOption 5 doesn't load breakpoints, and doesn't break at breakpoints/exceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional information</strong><br>\nThe external program and class library are both written in VB.NET, I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, and the target framework is .NET Framework 4.0.  </p>\n\n<p>Option 1 and 2 work for me, but after a while, all those dialogs and prompts become annoying, and slow me down. Option 3 and 4 seem more suitable for me, so if anyone can tell me how to get them to work, that would be great. Option 5 doesn't seem that interesting either, I don't want to be using regedit.exe all the time. If there are any other options, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Ruud Lenders</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3470,"score":2,"question_id":2748845,"title":"Microsoft JScript runtime error: '(function name)' is undefined","body":"<p>Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'txtGivenName_OnFocus' is undefined</p>\n\n<p>After adding what I thought was unrelated javascript code to a web page, I am suddenly getting errors that suggest that the browser cannot locate a javascript function that, to me, appears plain as day in design mode.</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking that this is a load sequence order problem of some sort.

Same behaviour... if the service is implemented returning an interface type, it fails. If i change it to return the concrete type, it works.
