I access the server from my laptop with SSH, and I can call family members to mess with router settings and such.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to use a MySQL database on a Ubuntu Server machine that I access remotely from a Windows 7 laptop. I have installed MySQL Connector C++ from the MySQL website (the msi installer). NOTE: I have not done anything with the Connector install except run the exe I downloaded. Didn't think I needed to compile anything, but I'm wrong a lot. I have created a database, a user who has privileges to the database, and this user can (in theory) connect from any ip, because it is declared as 'username@'%'. I also changed the my.cnf file so that the bind-address line is commented out. I used 'mysqladmin ping -h serveraddress -u username -p' and that gave me 'mysqld is alive', so I'm assuming the database is accessible from any ip remotely. So, I opened up VS 2010 Pro, made a new project, went to tools, and then 'Connect To Database'. I selected Microsoft MySQL Server and put in the information exactly as I did for mysqladmin. I clicked Test Connection and I get an error box that ends with 'provider: Named Pipes Provider, error 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server'. Sorry for the block of text, just want to give all the details I can.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully I'm close to making this work, I'm not pressed for time but I'm really tired of not being able to work on anything else in the project, since it all branches from this database connection.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks you all! I'll reply with whatever you need me to during the day, I'm not much of a night owl anymore =)</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nI have the sample code from the mysql site compiling correctly, it was just a matter of finally getting a few hours to sit down and fix linker/library errors one at a time, downloaded the boost libraries, and changed include directories to direct paths when I could get them to work correctly.

Like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class UserControl1 : UserControl\n{\n    private Collection&lt;Class1> field = null;\n    // later changed to:\n    //private Collection&lt;Class1> field = new Collection&lt;Class1>();\n    [Category(\"Data\")]\n    [DefaultValue(null)]\n    [Description(\"asdf\")]\n    public Collection&lt;Class1> prop\n    {\n        get { return field; }\n        set { field = value; }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>// later added:\n//[Serializable]\npublic class Class1\n{\n    private bool booltest; public bool Booltest { get...set...}\n    private int inttest; public int Inttest { get...set...}\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>If you already know what I screwed up: no need to read the rest.</b> I am going to describe what exactly I did.</p>\n\n<p>Now I put the <code>UserControl</code> onto a random Form and change the <code>Prop</code> property. A generic \"Collection Editor\" appears, like the one used for the columns and groups in a listview control. I can enter data as expected. However, when I click OK, the data is gone.</p>\n\n<p>It took me over hour to figure out that I actually have to instantiate my field: <code>private Collection&lt;MyClass&gt; field = new Collection&lt;MyClass&gt;();</code>.

When opening the designer of the Form where I use the <code>UserControl1</code> after editing something, it gives me an error:</p>\n\n<p><code>Object of type 'userctltest.Class1[]' cannot be converted to type 'userctltest.Class1[]'.</code></p>\n\n<p>Well. The Error List says:</p>\n\n<p><code>Warning: ResX file Object of type 'userctltest.Class1[]' cannot be converted to type 'userctltest.Class1[]'. Line 134, position 5. cannot be parsed.</code></p>\n\n<p>The designer tries to fetch the Property's data from the resx file. Removing the resx file \"solves\" that exactly once.</p>\n\n<p>The Form can now be displayed again, with my <code>UserControl1</code>.

What I saw was that my CPU usage stayed reasonable (&lt;20%), but the CPU Maximum Frequency pegged at 108% and stayed there until I stopped using the IDE. Once the Max Frequency came back down, the IDE immediately became responsive again. To isolate this problem to VS2010, I launched a few more applications (CAD, FEA, etc) and kept an eye on the Resource Monitor - everything was smooth and the Max Frequency did not peg, rather it fluctuated normally as you would expect.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are: Does this observation mean that the hardware (CPU) is not able to keep up with the software (VS2010)?

But when the second command is sent, the fgets call returns with an empty string and the next fgets call does not return. Here is the child process code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char *retStrP;\nchar str[256];\nsize_t strLen;\n\nretStrP = fgets(str, 256, stdin);\nstrLen = strlen(str);\nif (retStrP != str)\n{\n    char errorStr[256];\n    int a = feof(stdin);\n    int b = ferror(stdin);\n    sprintf(errorStr, \"Fgets error, %d %d\\n\", a, b);\n    OutputDebugString(errorStr);\n}\nelse if (strLen == 0)\n{\n    char errorStr[256];\n    int a = feof(stdin);\n    int b = ferror(stdin);\n    sprintf(errorStr, \"Strlen is 0, %d %d\\n\", a, b);\n    OutputDebugString(errorStr);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the previous code, the second call to fgets behaves as follow: the returned pointer is equal to the str buffer but the strlen is 0.</p>\n\n<p>When reading the MSDN fgets documentation ( <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c37dh6kf%28v=vs.100%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c37dh6kf%28v=vs.100%29.aspx</a> ), I don't see any way it could return the pointer to the buffer passed as the first argument with the first buffer's byte being set to 0 (as far as the buffer size is greater than 1).\nIf an error occurs or the end of file is reached, the fgets should return NULL and either feof or ferror should return something not 0.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect something is going wrong with the pipes handling but I can't figure out what...

All of a sudden, I'm getting this error in the design view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Invalid URI: The Authority/Host could not be parsed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Design view is completely frozen and won't let me do anything.  However, the program still compiles just fine, background image and all.  But obviously I can't continue my work on the program without the Design view.  How can I fix this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, in case someone asks, this program has not been changed AT ALL in between working on my old computer and not working on my new computer.  However, the version of VS2010 has changed from Premium to Ultimate, if that makes a difference.</p>\n\n<p>SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  I deleted the offending line of XAML code and attempted to re-add the background image to the window via the Design view (the Properties editor).  Everything works fine so long as the background is set to a solid color, but as soon as I click on the button to set an image as the background, before it even lets me pick an image, I get an error that says the property's value is not valid, referencing the same Invalid URI error as before.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","visual-studio-2010","app-config"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":11684940,"title":"Is it possible for <appSettings /> to contain settings AND refer to another <appSettings /> section in a different file?","body":"<p>Is it possible for me to have an <code>&lt;appSettings /&gt;</code> section in my app.config which contains a number of settings, but which also references an <code>&lt;appSettings /&gt;</code> section in a different file?</p>\n\n<p>This would allow me to keep config options that only the developer should be interested in, e.g. options to show debug output on the main window (very messy but useful to me) or to save certain files to specific locations.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this is what I'm trying to achieve:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- this is the appSettings section of the normal app.config file,\n     which also contains everything else that app.config would --&gt;\n&lt;appSettings configSource=\"AppSettings.config\"&gt; &lt;!-- references another file --&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"deployment_config_option1\" value=\"1\"/&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"deployment_config_option2\" value=\"2\"/&gt;\n&lt;/appSettings&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- this a new appSettings section of another file called DevSettings.Config\n     which only contains settings us developers are interested in\n     by keeping these settings in a different file, \n     I can ensure it's never deployed --&gt;\n&lt;appSettings&gt; &lt;!-- references another file --&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"show_debug_on_screen\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n  &lt;add key=\"save_copy_to_desktop\" value=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/appSettings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-2010","cpp-netlib"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13240295,"title":"cpp-netlib http response throws thread exception","body":"<p>I am using visual studio and cpp-netlib for my project and I have a function like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace http = boost::network::http;\nhttp::client::response make_get_request(const string&amp; uri) {\n  http::client client;\n  http::client::request request = make_request_header(uri);  // my custom function\n  http::client::response response = client.get(request);\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; response.body() &lt;&lt; std::endl;  // THIS LINE IS THE DEAL BREAKER\n  return response;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I comment out the cout line and return the response directly, it throws me an error unrelated to the cose, but somewhere in the thread library.

We've added new framework versions and used new versions of VS as time goes on, but we've never upgraded the Crystal version. With the simplicity of installing the Crystal 13 that comes with VS2010, however, I persuaded my boss to take a chance on upgrading our apps as we roll out fixes/updates to them. I converted an app from VS2005 and its reports to Crystal 13, installed framework 4.0 and Crystal 13 on our dev server, and all looked good. Then installed same on UAT, and all still looked good. Before I rolled it out to production, however, I had to make some changes to another very large app in a short enough timeframe that I could not upgrade it to VS2010/Crystal 13. Now I can't run the 9.1 Crystal reports on the large app in dev, and I'm afraid to move it to UAT if I can't even run them in dev. The most annoying part is that I'm not even getting an error message - it just doesn't work. I don't <em>know</em> that the addition of Crystal 13 caused the issue, but I made no changes to the report generation in this release and have no other explanation.</p>\n\n<p>The details:\nVS 2008 app with a 9.1 Crystal Report created in the application and exported to a pdf file on local server. I get no errors, but no pdf file ever gets exported or saved. I have confirmed that the user id running the application pool has access to the folder where it should be saved. I have confirmed that creating the report in preview mode in VS2008 and then exporting it from the preview window to that same folder does work. I found several references to running 10.5 with 13, but nothing about 9.1 with 13, and what they mentioned for 10.5 does not seem to apply to 9.1. The servers are running Windows Server 2003 SP2.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone successfully used Crystal 9.1 and Crystal 13 on the same server? I'm running out of time, year-end freeze is almost upon us, so I have to get these fixes out before (including running them through QA and UAT) early November or they get delayed to late January and that will NOT make my boss happy.</p>\n\n<p>Any and all help greatly appreciated!

All these tests run fine in Visual Studio 2012. However, some of my tests fail in Visual Studio 2010. In these failing tests, I use <strong>Moq</strong> to mock several Interop Types from <code>Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel</code>. The test fails immediately when attempting to access these mocked interop types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: Missing method 'instance class Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range [ExcelAddIn.Core] Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListRow::get_Range()' from class 'Castle.Proxies.ListRowProxy'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This exception implies that I forgot to setup the appropriate property getter on my mock. Which is not the case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>_listRowMock.Setup(m =&gt; m.Range).Returns(_rangeMock.Object);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I can imagine that Moq might not work too well with Interop Types. But what I find most puzzling is that these tests run fine in Visual Studio 2012, but fail in Visual Studio 2010. </p>\n\n<p>Why is my Visual Studio influencing the behavior of my code?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 3-11-2012</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ok, so I got it down to this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have two projects; Core and Core.UnitTest. Core is the actual library while Core.UnitTest is a unit test project of the Core library.</li>\n<li>Both projects reference Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel with Embed Interop Types enabled.</li>\n<li>Because EIT is enabled, both projects include their own \"view\" of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library. The view includes all classes, methods and properties that are used in their respective project.</li>\n<li>Because both projects use different classes, methods and properties of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, the embedded types of both libraries differ. E.g. ListRow in Core has an Index and Range property, whereas ListRow in Core.UnitTest only has the Range property.</li>\n<li>Although both types are different and do not share a common interface or super class, they are <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997297.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">equivalent</a></strong>. This means that the CLR will treat them as if they are the same and will allow you to use these types across assembly boundaries. E.g. an instance of ListRow from Core.UnitTest will work fine when passed to a method in the Core library. The shared Range property will function, whereas the missing Index property will throw a MissingMethodException on access.</li>\n<li>The aforementioned behavior even works with mocked types. An mocked object of  Mock[Excel.ListRow] will work fine when crossing the assembly boundary.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, the behavior described in the previous point only works when I build my assemblies in Visual Studio <strong>2012</strong>. When I build my assemblies in Visual Studio <strong>2010</strong> and debug my code, I can see the mocked ListRow instance being passed into a method of my Core project. The moment the instance crosses the assembly boundary, all methods and properties of ListRow lose their implementation and throw MissingMethodExceptions.</li>\n<li>Now for the fun part, I actually managed to mitigate this issue by ensuring that both embedded types of ListRow are aligned. E.g. in order for the compiler to create the same view of ListRow in both projects, I made sure that I used the exact same methods and properties in my UnitTest project. This means adding dummy lines like: var dummy = listRow.Index. Once I had the compiler creating identical views of my embedded ListRow type, the instance was allowed to cross assembly boundaries without losing its implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The question still remains though: What causes this difference in behavior between Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-2010","c++-cli"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":2,"question_id":13220210,"title":"C++ How to change a text label from outside the 'Form.h'?","body":"<p>I'm a C++ beginner and I have to get familiar with some simple things.\nI made a form with 1 label and 1 button.\nI want to change the text of the label by clicking on the button and calling some text via a void in another cpp class (changetext.cpp)</p>\n\n<p>Structure:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Form1.h //just a regular form code with 1 label and 1 button handler at the end</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#pragma once\n\nnamespace ms {\n\nusing namespace System;\nusing namespace System::ComponentModel;\nusing namespace System::Collections;\nusing namespace System::Windows::Forms;\nusing namespace System::Data;\nusing namespace System::Drawing;\n\n/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Summary for Form1\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic ref class Form1 : public System::Windows::Forms::Form\n{\npublic:\n    Form1(void)\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        //\n        //TODO: Add the constructor code here\n        //\n    }\n\npublic:\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Clean up any resources being used.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    ~Form1()\n    {\n        if (components)\n        {\n            delete components;\n        }\n    }\npublic: System::Windows::Forms::Label^  label1;\nprivate: System::Windows::Forms::Button^  button1;\npublic: \npublic: \n\npublic:\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Required designer variable.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    System::ComponentModel::Container ^components;\n\n    #pragma region Windows Form Designer generated code\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Required method for Designer support - do not modify\n    /// the contents of this method with the code editor.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    void InitializeComponent(void)\n    {\n        this-&gt;label1 = (gcnew System::Windows::Forms::Label());\n        this-&gt;button1 = (gcnew System::Windows::Forms::Button());\n        this-&gt;SuspendLayout();\n        // \n        // label1\n        // \n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;AutoSize = true;\n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;Location = System::Drawing::Point(313, 140);\n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;Name = L\"label1\";\n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;Size = System::Drawing::Size(35, 13);\n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;TabIndex = 0;\n        this-&gt;label1-&gt;Text = L\"label1\";\n        // \n        // button1\n        // \n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;Location = System::Drawing::Point(101, 117);\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;Name = L\"button1\";\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;Size = System::Drawing::Size(100, 58);\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;TabIndex = 1;\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;Text = L\"button1\";\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;UseVisualStyleBackColor = true;\n        this-&gt;button1-&gt;Click += gcnew System::EventHandler(this,               &amp;Form1::button1_Click);\n        // \n        // Form1\n        // \n        this-&gt;AutoScaleDimensions = System::Drawing::SizeF(6, 13);\n        this-&gt;AutoScaleMode = System::Windows::Forms::AutoScaleMode::Font;\n        this-&gt;ClientSize = System::Drawing::Size(467, 262);\n        this-&gt;Controls-&gt;Add(this-&gt;button1);\n        this-&gt;Controls-&gt;Add(this-&gt;label1);\n        this-&gt;Name = L\"Form1\";\n        this-&gt;Text = L\"Form1\";\n        this-&gt;Load += gcnew System::EventHandler(this, &amp;Form1::Form1_Load);\n        this-&gt;ResumeLayout(false);\n        this-&gt;PerformLayout();\n\n    }\n    #pragma endregion\npublic: System::Void Form1_Load(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) {\n\n\n         }\nprivate: System::Void button1_Click(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) {\n\n             changetext my = new changetext();\n             my.changeText();\n\n         }\n};\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>ms.cpp (main) //just creates the form</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>// ms.cpp : main project file.\n\n#include \"stdafx.h\"\n#include \"Form1.h\"\n\nusing namespace ms;\n\n[STAThreadAttribute]\nint main(array&lt;System::String ^&gt;

I'm wondering if there is a setting somewhere that got messed up to not break INTO referenced libraries? </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<p>WinApp:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Widget myWidget = new Widget();\nmyWidget.DeleteFiles();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the widget class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void DeleteFiles()\n{\n   foreach (FileInfo currFile in ThisWidgetsFileCollection)\n   {  File.Delete(currFile.FullName);}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the widget can't delete the file (due to access restrictions), the debugger breaks to the line </p>\n\n<pre><code>myWidget.DeleteFiles();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NOT</p>\n\n<pre><code>{currFile.Delete();}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hopefully that makes sense?

Anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio-2010","visual-c++"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":5,"view_count":53,"score":-4,"question_id":13213723,"title":"How to remove the duplicate directories from a path in C++","body":"<p>I have a path like this</p>\n\n<pre><code> \"C:\\Users\\Desktop\\new3oct\\31oct\\Project\\Project\\\\bin\\\\logsgs\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By programming I have to remove duplicate directories from it.

The VS debugger will just refuse to accept the original PDB file generated for the original EXE, presumably because the ILMerge step either updates the checksum or changes the GUID.</p>\n\n<p>What I wonder is if there's any way around this.. like some little known ILMerge option, maybe?  It strikes me as a very common and unnecessary loss of debugging ability.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the only other way to debug such an app after localization is to maintain a parallel build option that uses the DLLs un-ILMerged, which is fine, unless you happen to want to debug the localization code itself (for example, me).. then you're really out of luck.  Can anyone think of other options?</p>\n\n<p>I also tried using Costura, but because localization DLLs all contain resources that are identically named (and are identical to the main resource AppName.resource), you can only add one such DLL to the References: subsequent ones are not allowed.

(if it could be made to work though, the PDB problem might not occur as the combination is part of the the visual studio build..?)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I'm looking for ideas that result in a PDB/EXE match.

Only will a breakpoint be hit if I set it on the line after that, <code>xor eax, eax</code>, or any subsequent line.</p>\n\n<p>I have even tried inserting a software breakpoint, <code>int 3</code>, as the first line of the function, and it is also ignored.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this so?</p>\n\n<p>Update: Viewing the disassembly after hitting one of my breakpoints gives me the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>01370FFF  add         byte ptr [ecx+6],bh  \n--- [Path]\\main.asm \n        xor eax, eax\n00841005  xor         eax,eax  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint is hit here\n_label: add eax, ecx\n00841007  add         eax,ecx  \n        dec ecx\n00841009  dec         ecx  \n        jnz _label\n0084100A  jne         _label (841007h)  \n        cmp eax, 21\n0084100C  cmp         eax,15h  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What's interesting here is that the <code>xor</code> is, in Visual Studio's eyes, the first operation in my program.  Absent is the line <code>move ecx, 6</code>.  Directly above where it thinks my source begins is the line that actually sets <code>ecx</code> to 6.</p>\n\n<p>If I make the first line of my program <code>int 3</code>, the line that appears above where my code is in the disassembly is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00F80FFF  add         ah,cl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am quite confused, and very curious as to why this happens.  Is this some oddity in the way Visual Studio treats assembly programs?</p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:  The source code is up-to-date at the time that I run the program.</p>\n\n<p>Update #2: As suggested, I turned off ASLR, and it looks like the disassembly is a little more stable, but the problem still persists:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.CODE\nmain PROC\n        ;mov ecx, 6\n        xor eax, eax\n00401000  xor         eax,eax  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint is present here, but not hit.\n_label: add eax, ecx\n00401002  add         eax,ecx  --- &lt;-- Breakpoint here is hit.\n        dec ecx\n00401004  dec         ecx  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Despite my program starting on an expected address, <strong>and</strong> the first breakpoint being shown in the disassembly, it is still skipped.  Placing an <code>int 3</code> as the first line still results in the following line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00400FFF  add         ah,cl  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and does not stop execution.  The next line of my program is then at location <code>00401001</code>.  It also might be of interest that Visual Studio will automatically place a breakpoint on the same line as <code>int 3</code> during execution, even though this breakpoint is not hit.</p>\n\n<p>Even starting the program using the 'Step Into (F11)' command does not allow me to break on the first line.  In fact, with no breakpoint, starting the program with F11 does not halt execution at all.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","visual-c++","vmware","bootcamp","libsndfile"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":1,"question_id":13125721,"title":"C++ Program Not Reading Absolute Path in Visual Studio 2010","body":"<p>I have a C++ program not reading an absolute path in Visual Studio. </p>\n\n<p>The following code works on my desktop environment (Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010, 64 bit). \nHowever, on my macbook, I am running bootcamp and/or VMware for a Windows 7 64 bit virtual machine that has the exact same Visual Studio 2010. </p>\n\n<p>My attempts at fixing this problem: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I made sure that the absolute path is the same on my macbook as it is on the desktop.

Only having little experience with C++, I chose Visual Studio as IDE, updated with SP1. I got the solution to build relatively easily and wanted to navigate the code a little to get an overview.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I noticed that sometimes \"Go to Definition\"/\"Go to declaration\" doesn't work. Both options are available when I right-click on a symbol in the source code, but when I'm in the header file, \"Go to Definition\" only takes me to the declaration again for those functions that are concerned. And when I'm in the .cc file, I always get taken to the definition in the same file.</p>\n\n<p>Some more things I've noticed about the functions which are concerned by this are:</p>\n\n<p>1) for some functions, I can navigate to the definition from the header file, but the other direction is broken</p>\n\n<p>2) navigation for some functions can be fixed if the declaration is changed to completely match the definition, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>header declaration:\n    void buche(sint64 betrag, player_cost type);\nsource definition:\n    void karte_t::buche(sint64 const betrag, player_cost const type)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>change to</p>\n\n<pre><code>header declaration:\n    void buche(sint64 const betrag, player_cost const type);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-> navigation works in both directions</p>\n\n<p>3) when clicking into a code block of a concerned function in the source file, the scope menu at the top changes to \"(Global Scope)\" instead of showing the little arrow to the right (which is the symbol for a forward declaration I think?) and the class name (but those functions are definitely class members)</p>\n\n<p>I've searched around a lot and this seems to be a relatively well-known problem. There's a thread here on the site: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39474/how-to-get-intellisense-to-reliably-work-in-visual-studio-2008\">How to get intellisense to reliably work in Visual Studio 2008</a></p>\n\n<p>I also found several threads on the Microsoft forums (which I can't link as I'm only allowed to post two hyperlinks), but no official confirmation of a bug or something.</p>\n\n<p>The quintessence of the replies I found is that one should delete the .ncb file (which has been superseded by an .sdf database in VS2010 as I understand it), or use the option to rebuild the database on loading the solution. I did all of that multiple times, to no avail. The highest rated reply on the thread here on Stackoverflow seems to implicate that this is simply a bug (of Intellisense - did I get it right that it's this autocomplete component which is also responsible for the code navigation?) one has to accept, suggesting to use <a href=\"http://www.wholetomato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual Assist</a> instead, however the question was about VS2008 then and one reply pointed to VS2010 improving on this. Another reply blamed recursive references, but I -think- this is not a problem in this project as all the files (certainly those few I've checked and encountered the problems with) have include guards. It has also been confirmed to me by one coder of that project that he has the same problems. But I'm not so keen on spending money on Visual Assist, it's only meant to be a little hobby ...</p>\n\n<p>Having a lot of experience with Eclipse/Java, it just seems weird to me that such a relatively essential feature of an IDE doesn't work reliably. Of course I can understand that static code analysis is much more difficult for C++ than for Java.

I would like the <code>onAsyncTask</code> to forward the function back to <code>CPlugin</code>. <code>hwnd</code> is a handle to the window.</p>\n\n<p>In <code>CPlugin</code> I've:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void CPlugin::ShowMessageBox( void* arg ) {\n    wchar_t* text = (wchar_t*)arg;\n    MessageBox( NULL, text, L\"Title\", MB_OK )\n}\n\nvoid CPlugin::Sender( ) {\n    std::function&lt;void(void*)&gt; f = std::bind( &amp;CPlug::ShowMessagebox, \n                                              this, \n                                              std::placeholders::_1 );\n    PostMessage( hwnd, WM_ASYNC_TASK, (WPARAM)f, (LPARAM)\"Hello!!\" );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In CHiddenWindow at the handler of WM_ASYNC_TASK message I've:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void CHiddinWindow::onAsyncTask( WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam, /* more arguments */ )\n{\n    std::function&lt;void(void*)&gt; f = (std::function&lt;void(void*)&gt;)wparam;\n    void* arg = lparam;\n    f( arg );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>Questions</b>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Currently, the compiler complains when I'm trying to cast f to WPARAM, within <code>PostMessage</code> (<code>WPARAM</code> is basically a long).</li>\n<li>I'm OK if I'm taking the address of <code>f</code>: <code>(WPARAM)&amp;f</code>.</li>\n<li>Which raise another question about the life cycle of f. How do I keep it?</li>\n<li>When passing <code>&amp;f</code> (keeping <code>f</code> outside <code>Sender()</code> - not my desire), I'm getting access violation in <code>onAsyncHandler</code>, when trying to dereference <code>f</code>.</li>\n<li>About the life cycle, can I put f under the control of <code>std::shared_ptr</code> somehow?</li>\n<li>There is no real reason to pass the argument to my function (in my case - the text) in wparam. I think there should be a way to have the text part of the <code>std::function</code> object, but fail with the syntax.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I said, I'm on VS 2010 before variadic templates.

Suppose I have this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Helpers\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" /&gt;\n      &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"1.0.0.0-2.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"2.0.0.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" /&gt;\n      &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"1.0.0.0-4.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"4.0.0.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose I want to completely erase the <code>dependentAssembly</code> node, and its children, that matches the xpath <code>//runtime/assemblyBinding/dependentAssembly[assemblyIdentity@name='System.Web.Mvc']</code>.  To do that, I might want something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity \n          name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" \n          xdt:Remove \n          xdt:Locator=\"Condition(..[*@name=$name])\" \n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well obviously I made up the syntax <code>@name=$name</code> based on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/wiki/Variables_in_XPath\" rel=\"nofollow\">xpath variable concepts</a>, but this example demonstrates why I'd want that feature.  Is this supported?  How must I adjust my syntax to take advantage of this?  I could put in a string literal, but I just want to know if this is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another way I might try to delete the <code>dependentAssembly</code> node, is with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;\n  &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" xdt:Transform=\"Remove\"&gt;\n    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n      &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" xdt:Locator=\"Match(name)\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n  &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the <code>Transform</code> is on a grand-parent node, and the locator is on leaf node. Is the above legitimate?  The idea is to remove only the <code>dependantAssembly</code> node that has an internal Locator Match.</p>\n\n<p>These two approaches aside, how would you go about deleting the targeting <code>dependantAssembly</code> and all its child nodes?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":13150343,"title":"The constant cannot be marked static","body":"<p>I am trying to declare a PI constant like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static const double PI = Math.PI;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but why am I getting this error?</p>\n\n<pre><code>The constant 'Calendar.NewCalendar.PI' cannot be marked static\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","qt-vs-addin"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":11941885,"title":"moc-ed files being exluded from build in Visual Studio 2010","body":"<p>I have a VS2010 solution with couple of Qt-based projects.

When the user clicks on this link, the report is exported to Word and displayed as an editable word 2003 document.  Our users are able to modify this document and type additional information at the bottom before sending it to the client.</p>\n\n<p>We migrated this report to Crystal Reports 10.2 that comes with Visual Studio 2005 and since in this version of CR, all report items are placed in text boxes, the formatting is quite different from the original and where users used to type at the bottom, there is a small textbox that limits their ability to type freely.  Also font sizes are reduced by half a size and both report headers and footers end up outside of Word header and footer sections. We spoke to CR support and they asked us to apply a service pack and try Visual Studio 2010 which we did with no luck.</p>\n\n<p>Next we tried SSRS reports with our SQL Server 2005 and found out that this version does not support export to Word so we installed the free SQL Server 2008 Express with Advanced options that offers SSRS.  However another interesting fact we found was that Visual Studio 2005 does not support report projects so we moved the projects to BIDS that comes with SQL Server 2008 Express.  Anyhow, similar to CR, SSRS also places all report items in text boxes and changes all our original formatting when exported to Word 2003.  It also leaves some bits and pieces of borders of tables and textboxes visible on the document.  The header and footer do end up in Word header and footers unlike CR but the margins are not the same as when they were created in SSRS.  We also tried Word 2010 and had a similar experience.</p>\n\n<p>Next we tried to do the report in Word itself directly.  We installed Visual Studio office tools second edition over our Visual Studio 2005 professional edition and that only gave us the AddIn creation capability and not document projects.  Apparently at some point Microsoft provided Visual Studio Office tools for sale that had that option but it is no longer available.

When I was searching for the answer I found that this may have been caused by the in-built code optimiser but didn't manage to learn anything else.

Otherwise, I guess my shutdown process will have to be a LOT more thorough with resetting all the visual elements. Registry values seem to ignore, override, or bypass my startup code.

You open a client document and you can manipulate the client data. It has a large server-side park for storing the documents and all changes and it's huge.

We've adjusted all kinds of code for over a week but did not notice that an error started to occur because we run the app with a debugger active. (We should have tested it outside the debugger but we all forgot this, apparently.)<br>\nToday, I tried to start the app without debugger and I could log in, but after trying to open a client document, it crashed, and crashed hard! Black Screen of Death in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer just restarts. Firefox and other browsers go down too. No indication of where the error is located.<br>\nOkay, repeating it with the debugger active and the App is well-behaved again. No crashes, nothing. It works just as we'd expect it to work.  </p>\n\n<p>After using our source control system to find the moment in time when the bug was introduced, we finally did manage to discover when it was introduced, which helped us to find the cause of the problem. As it turned out, a bound property would raise a PropertyChanged event on several other properties. But those others would also raise more PropertyChanged events on more properties and somehow, this created an eternal loop of raised events. All this because a change was made to a single property.<br>\nThis means the problem is solved, but does not explain why the code would work just fine in the debugger, while it also crashes fatally without the debugger.

The cause is that there is a web.config file in a subfolder instead of the root folder.  We did not make and do not want this change, and cannot figure out how to control it. Deleting the Backup\\Web.config file fixes the error.

In each app I start a thread, and in the Thread I do a Debug.WriteLine</p>\n\n<p>It seems to get some sort of deadlock and stop writing the output.  This appears to be a bug in Visual Studio, which I am highly surprised at.  Must I believe that it is impossible to have 2 projects with threads doing Debug.WriteLine at the same time ?</p>\n\n<p>Once again, I am in deperate need of a way to fix this and still get Debug Output.\nOh, and I have also tried the option of redirecting output to the immediate window with no success either.</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":916,"score":2,"question_id":5992094,"title":"Debug.Writeline stops working","body":"<p>We have a solution with multiple projects after running the code from VS the output normally seen from Debug.Writeline statements just cease to appear.
