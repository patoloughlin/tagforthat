I thought a temporary iframe would be a good idea - but simply no idea how to implement such a thing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"uploadform\"&gt;\n            &lt;form id = \"uploadpicform\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" action=\"uploadpic.php\" method=\"POST\"&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt;Photo: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"photo\"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Caption:&lt;/p&gt; My &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n                   &lt;input type=\"submit\" class=\"large blue button\" value=\"Add\"&gt; \n            &lt;/form&gt;\n            &lt;script&gt;\n            // wait for the DOM to be loaded\n            $(document).ready(function() {\n                // bind 'myForm' and provide a simple callback function\n                $('#uploadpicform').ajaxForm(function() {\n                $(\"#hideuploadbutton\").hide();\n                $(\"#uploadbutton\").show();\n                $(\"#uploadform\").hide();\n                });\n            });             \n            &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What that does at the moment, is submits the form, with no notice, hides the upload button and shows an open upload button to start the process again. I figure there must be some sort of 'add iframe' or 'print php variable from the other page' option or something.</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any help, thanks a bunch!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":114,"score":5,"question_id":13204656,"title":"Too many open file error, java.io.FileNotFoundException","body":"<p>In my program I have loop that scans a bunch of files and reads their content.

I'm reading in a file ( a small exe of 472 KB ) with FileInputStream, i plan to send the file torugh RMI connection, and i had an idea, where i could show the upload's % based on how much have i already sent trough compared to the overall length of the file.</p>\n\n<p>First i tried it out locally and i couldn't get it work. Here is an example, what i was doing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>FileInputStream fileData = new FileInputStream(file);\nreads = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\nbuffers = new ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt;();\nint i = 0;\nwhile ( (read = fileData.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n      System.out.println(\"Run : \" + (i + 1));\n      outstreamA.write(buffer, 0, read);\n      reads.add(read);\n      buffers.add(buffer);\n      outstreamB.write(this.buffers.get(i), 0, this.reads.get(i));\n      i = i + 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This two FileOutputStream creates two files ( same ones just with different name ), works fine. However, when i'm not using fileData.read() but any other for / while, it just dosen't work. It creates the exact same file ( length is exactly the same ) but my Window cannot run the exe, i get an error message :\n\"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running...\".</p>\n\n<p>This is how i tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffers.size(); ++i) {\n  i = 0;\n//while ( (read = fileData2.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n  while ( i &lt; size) {\n      System.out.println(\"Run#2 : \" + (i + 1));\n      outstreamC.write(this.buffers.get(i), 0, this.reads.get(i));\n      i = i + 1;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>fileData2 is the same as fileData. If i work with fileData2.read(buffer), outstreamC creates a working file aswell. </p>\n\n<p>It dosen't matter if i run with for till the list's size, or till \"size\" which equals the time i entered the first while. There is something missing, and i cannot figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>The weird thing is, outstreamB creates a working file, yet outstreamC cannot, but they working with the exact same items.</p>\n\n<p>Originally i was planning to pass the \"read\" and \"buffer\" each time i entered the first while trough RMI connection, and put everything together on the other side, after all the parts arrived, but now my plan is kinda dead. Anyone has maybe an idea, how could i solve this, or achieve something similar to be able to send files trough RMI?</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,\nMihaly</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","file"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13203587,"title":"Java - Converting a text area to a string","body":"<p>I am having a little trouble here, I want to convert a text area into a string, so i can store it in a new string and pass it to a txt file.

However, PHP's <code>dirname()</code> will return only \"http://example.com\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if it thinks that \"blog\" is an extension-less file, if that exists, but I can't really find a solution.</p>\n\n<h2>Things I've Tried</h2>\n\n<p>I first tried getting the extension of the URL using this quick method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$url = 'http://example.com/index.php';\n$file_extension = end(explode('.', $filename));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I would check if the extension existed using PHP <code>empty()</code>. If the extension exists, that means that a filename was entered after the folder, such as \"http://example.com/path/file.html\", and <code>dirname()</code> is perfect. If the extension doesn't exist, no file was entered and the last item in the path is a folder, so it is already \"the base\".</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of simply \"http://example.com/path/\", the above would return \".com/path/\" as the file extension, which we all know doesn't exist. In this case, I would use the <code>dirname()</code> function and cut off \"/path/\".</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Taking the extension of <code>basename($url)</code> won't work because if the user enters \"http://example.com\" <code>basename()</code> returns \"example.com\", the extension for which is supposedly \n\".com\"</p>\n\n<h3>Hopefully, someone has had the same problem and knows the solution.

The examples I have seen use the WebMatrix File Helper (File Helper? Is that right? Oh well, it's a helper of some kind that auto plots the html necessary for the input=type\"file\" field).

Sorry if that's a little TMI, just trying to be thorough, but to refine the question:  I don't know enough about file uploading to know how to work with the uploaded data that well yet.  I tried researching this information, but I didn't find any information that seemed pertinent to me (actually, I didn't find much useful information on input type=\"file\", or the FileUpload method, at all, really).  </p>\n\n<p>Would it be better to use input type=\"file\" id=\"pic1id\"? Is there something that I can use such as Request.Files[\"pic1id\"] that could get the file from the id of the input element? Or does the program simply take all uploaded files, stick them in a logistical group somewhere waiting to be called by index like this: \"Request.Files[0]\".  If so, what order does the index get put in? Do I need to use Request.Files.Count to test how many have been uploaded before I begin working with the data?</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I want separate input type=\"file\" fields (whether plotted by the helper or not).  I do not want to accept multiple files in one input (mainly because of a lack of knowledge, e.g., I am afraid I won't know how to work with the data).  So far, the plan is that the separate input type=\"file\" fields will be within the divs that get hidden/unhidden upon scrolling through pictures, so each picture (space) will have its own input type=\"file\" field.  The hiding and unhiding of divs, (the one) picture being displayed, storing and receiving binary data from the database, and clicking through the picture placeholders all function great.  Pretty much I just need to know how to work with more than one uploaded picture at a time for storage in their individual database \"image\" fields.</p>\n\n<p>Any examples of the syntax I need to use will be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry so many questions, but I just couldn't find much useful information on this at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to any who try to help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","file","cgi","open"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13122250,"title":"CGI c file open","body":"<p>I have created a cgi file in c.

It is because perl is generating the output file in unix format which has a control ^M character at the end of each line. so to convert the unix format file to linux format file, i need to use a command call \"unix2dos\" which is not available in windows.

My files saves nicely using the <strong>save</strong> command.</p>\n\n<p>My question is more in the sense: Why am I observing the following surprising (for me) behavior in MATLAB?</p>\n\n<p>let's look at my issue in general. In this current test-scenario I will be generating one output: A -v7.3 mat-file. This .mat-file will contain 40 <em>blocks</em> as individual variables. Each variable will be named \"block_NNN\" from 1 to 40 and will contain a struct with fields <em>frames</em> and <em>blockNo</em>. Field <em>frames</em> contains a 480x240x65 sequence of uint8 imagedata (here just random data generated using <strong>randi</strong>). Field <em>blockNo</em> contains the block number.</p>\n\n<p>Remark: <em>In the real script (that I have yet to finish) I will be doing the above at total of 370 times, converting a total of 108GB of raw data. Which is why I am concerned with the following.</em></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, first I define some general variables:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% some sizes for dummy data and loops:\nnum_blockCount = 40;\nnum_blockLength = 65;\nnum_frameHeight = 480;\nnum_frameWidth = 240;\n</pre>\n\n<p>I then generate some dummy code that has shape and size identical to the actual raw data:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% generate empty struct:\nstu_data2disk = struct();\n\n% loop over blocks:\nfor num_k = 1:num_blockCount\n\n   % generate block-name:\n   temp_str_blockName = sprintf('block_%03u', num_k);\n\n   % generate temp struct for current block:\n   temp_stu_value = struct();\n   temp_stu_value.frames = randi( ...\n      [0 255], ...\n      [num_frameHeight num_frameWidth num_blockLength], ...\n      'uint8' ...\n   );\n   temp_stu_value.blockNo = num_k;\n\n   % using dynamic field names:\n   stu_data2disk.(sprintf('block_%03u', num_k)) = temp_stu_value;\n\nend\n</pre>\n\n<p>I now have all my random test-data in a struct <strong>stu_data2disk</strong>. Now I would like to save the data using one of two possible methods.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try the simple one first:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% save data (simple):\ndisp('Save data the simple way:')\ntic;\nsave converted.mat -struct stu_data2disk -v7.3;\ntoc;\n</pre>\n\n<p>The file is written without problems (286MB). The output is:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSave data the simple way:\nElapsed time is 14.004449 seconds.\n</pre>\n\n<p>OK - then I remembered that I would like to follow the save-procedure over the 40 blocks. Thus instead of the above I loop over the blocks and append them in sequence:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% save to file, using append:\ndisp('Save data using -append:')\ntic;\nfor num_k = 1:num_blockCount\n\n   % generate block-name:\n   temp_str_blockName = sprintf('block_%03u', num_k);\n\n   temp_str_appendToggle = '';\n   if (num_k > 1)\n      temp_str_appendToggle = '-append';\n   end\n\n   % generate save command:\n   temp_str_saveCommand = [ ...\n      'save ', ...\n      'converted_append.mat ', ...\n      '-struct stu_data2disk ', temp_str_blockName, ' '...\n      temp_str_appendToggle, ' ', ...\n      '-v7.3', ...\n      ';' ...\n   ];\n\n   % evaluate save command:\n   eval(temp_str_saveCommand);\n\nend\ntoc;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And again the file saves nicely (286MB). The output is:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSave data using -append:\nElapsed time is 0.956968 seconds.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Interestingly the append-method is much faster? <strong>My question is why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Output from <strong><code>dir converted*.mat</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre>\n09-02-2011  20:38       300,236,392 converted.mat\n09-02-2011  20:37       300,264,316 converted_append.mat\n               2 File(s)    600,500,708 bytes\n</pre>\n\n<p>The files are not identical in size. And a test with <strong>fc</strong> in windows 7 revealed ... well many binary differences. Perhaps the data was shifted a bit - thus this tells us nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Does someone have an idea what is going on here? Is the appended file using a much more optimized data-structure perhaps? Or maybe windows has cached the file and makes access to it much faster?</p>\n\n<p>I made the effort of test-reading from the two files as well.

I believe I have read somewhere that HDF5 should optimized in this very way... though cannot be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Other details to note:</p>\n\n<p>The behavior is very systemic as we see in Andrew's answer below. It also seems to be quite important as to whether or not you run these things in a local scope of a function or in the \"global\" of an m-script. My first results were from an m-script where files were written to the current directory. I can still only reproduce the 1-second write for -7.3 in the m-script. The function-calls add some overhead appearently.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,\nOle</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","file","directory","split"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":91,"score":-1,"question_id":13048366,"title":"How to split directory path components in string in java","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6174182/how-to-split-the-string-in-java\">how to split the string in java</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>FileSystemView fsv = FileSystemView.getFileSystemView();\nFile[] roots = fsv.getRoots();\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; roots.length; i++)\n{\n  System.out.println(\"Root: \" + roots[i]);\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Home directory: \" + fsv.getHomeDirectory());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Root: C:\\Users\\RS\\Desktop\nHome directory: C:\\Users\\RS\\Desktop</p>\n\n<p>I want cut the root or Home Directory components like \nString C, Users, RS, Desktop</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","file","delete","windows-services"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":48,"score":-1,"question_id":13048261,"title":"Windows service file delete","body":"<p>Windows service </p>\n\n<pre><code> protected override void OnStart(string[] args)       \n {\n }\n\n //my method\n public void silsene(string yol)\n {\n     System.IO.DirectoryInfo myDirInfo = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(yol);\n\n     foreach (System.IO.FileInfo file in myDirInfo.GetFiles())\n     {\n         file.Delete();\n     }\n\n     foreach (System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir in myDirInfo.GetDirectories())\n     {\n         dir.Delete(true);\n     }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how windows form my method call</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","file","upload","directory"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13046103,"title":"ruby on rails how to add files to a folder for direct use","body":"<p>I want to add some <code>.c files</code>  <strong>manually</strong> in my website for others to be able to see them with a direct link in their browser...</p>\n\n<p>Where do i add these files and how can i link to them in a view file?</p>\n\n<p>Do i simply create a folder in the assets or in the root of the site and link manually like</p>\n\n<p><code>http://www.mysite.com/path/to/file</code>?</p>\n\n<p>is it possible to make this use routes <strong>like</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>this_route_path()</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["file","validation","upload","struts2","size"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":98,"score":0,"question_id":12900045,"title":"Struts2 Upload File, validating size and content type file before send file","body":"<p>I have a problem with Struts 2 and its file upload interceptor.

Most of our customers have a Dutch Windows installation and also most of them have their Regional Settings set to Dutch (nl-NL), implying the . (period) for grouping and the , (comma) as decimal separator.</p>\n\n<p>Out of our almost 10,000 customers, only ONE (1) had a problem, the cause of which we identified as originating in a call to SHGetFileInfo to get a (small) icon for a file. Relevant statements in the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We assessed that - at the particular PC of this customer - before the (first) call to SHGetFileInfo the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture was (nl-NL), as expected, but immediately after the call the CurrentCulture had switched to (en-US), which obviously caused problems elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Pausing the code at that point and inspecting the Configuration Panel, the Regional Settings THERE were still Dutch (nl-NL). Also, no SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged (or -Changing) events were caught in the code. After stopping and restarting the program, the CurrentCulture in the program was again Dutch (nl-NL) - until the first SHGetFileInfo call.</p>\n\n<p>In a practical sense we solved the issue by resetting the CurrentCulture if necessary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo0 Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n\n  Private Shared Function SHGetFileInfo(pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n    Dim ciBefore As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n\n    Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo0(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n\n    Dim ciAfter As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n    If (ciAfter.Name &lt;&gt; ciAfter.Name) OrElse (ciBefore IsNot ciAfter) Then\n      Application.CurrentCulture = ciBefore\n    End If\n\n    Return result\n  End Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the problem showed up only on that particular customer-PC, I had to analyze the issue on his PC , limiting my time to check things out. So, after solving the issue for him in the practical sense, I'm left with the unpleasant fact that I don't know how this could happen and my question, therefore, is: can anybody shed some light in this darkness?</p>\n\n<p>Additional information: the customer did not have this problem until a month ago. Recently he has started using (and presumably installed) DropBox and BoxSync. I have no knowledge of the internal workings of these, but as they also \"use files\" and their installations more or less coincide with the problem showing up, I do have suspicions that there may be a connection.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I've sufficiently stated the issue, but if more information is needed, I'll be glad to try and provide this.

I already have checks for whether the input is a folder and now I need to check whether the folder actually contains a .vm file. \nWhat I've done so far is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'pathname'\n\npn = Pathname.new(ARGV[0])\n\nif ARGV.size != 1\n    puts \"Proper usage is: ruby vmtranslator.rb file_directory\\file.vm \\nOR \\nruby vmtranslator.rb file_directory\\ where file_directory has multiple vm files test\".split(\"\\n\")\nelsif !pn.exist? &amp;&amp; !pn.directory?\n    puts \"Something is wrong with the file\"\n    puts \"Either try another file or check the file extension\"\nelsif pn.directory? &amp;&amp; pn.children(false).extname.include?('.vm')\n    puts \"this should print if Folder1 is the folder, but not if Folder2 is..\"\n    vm_file1 = File.open(\"OPEN FILES WITH .vm AS EXTENSION)\nelsif pn.exist? || pn.file?\n    puts \"this is right\"\n    vm_file = File.open(ARGV[0], \"r\")\n    asm_file = File.new(ARGV[0].sub('.vm', '.asm'), \"w\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what that should do is check whether there is only 1 argument first, if so, then it checks if it's a file or directory else it outputs an error, then what I'm doing is checking if it's a directory. If so, I need to check if the directory actually contains .vm files. I tried <code>pn.each_child {|f| f.extname == '.vm'}</code> but that only checks the first value before it returns true. Is there any easier way to check the whole array before returning true, other than just setting some boolean?</p>\n\n<p>Some of the code up there isn't done, I'm just asking if there is any way to check a directory for a file of a certain extension. I can't find anything with my searches so far.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","file"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":12946243,"title":"Anyone knows that the file values-sw580?","body":"<p>I find an strange file named <code>values-sw580</code> in my Android contact code .I don't know what is this for and why it calls this way.Anyone know about it ?:） tell me please.thanx.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","linux","file","unix","words"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":109,"score":0,"question_id":12942806,"title":"Remove rare words from a very large file","body":"<p>Given a very large text file, I want to remove all the words which occur only once in the file.

I've tried many different things to break the data into a separate project and just reference that instead through various methods, with not much luck.  My goal is so I can click run in eclipse for each project separately and they both load from the same data.</p>\n\n<p>When the project is finally built, there will be 3 jars (the two projects,+ a lib), which will be in the same directory with the xml and xsd folders.  So any file references to the XSD/XMLs are currently in the format like this: File file = new File(\"xml/pixtilemaps.xml\");</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't work in eclipse, but works during export because of the file structure is sound.  I tried using virtual folders in each of the projects, but it doesn't look like runtime references to relative files use the virtual folders in the way I was expecting.  I've tried adding each as a linked resource, added the project on the build path, etc, but whatever I do, it doesn't seem to treat the xml folder as a relative folder.  I get an error like : file:/F:/workspace/com.myoid.editor/xsd/pixtilemaps.xsd does not exist.  Because it takes it relative to the project. I've also tried to find a run configuration solution to this, but there is obviously something I'm not understanding to get this to work the way I want.  </p>\n\n<p>So in summary, have an xsd folder, xml folder in a 3rd eclipse project, that I want 1 and 2 to be able to access through relative file paths like File file = new File(\"xml/pixtilemaps.xml\");</p>\n\n<p><strong>How I fixed it:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay.. so.. maybe there is a better solution but this is what I came up with... In Eclipse under run configurations you can specify the working directory that the launch will run from.  So I put all xml/xsd in for both projects in the same \"working directory\".  In the run configuration for each project I point the working directory to the 3rd project, and viola, it works like I had expected.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","file"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12885958,"title":"Failing creating a txt file with subfolders in Android","body":"<p>Fellow programmers.\nCuold you possibly take a look on this simple code frag and tell me what's wrong here?</p>\n\n<pre><code>        File dir = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/asteroids/modules\"); \n        File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/asteroids/modules/\" + fileName);             \n\n        if (!file.exists()) {     \n            dir.mkdir();\n            file.createNewFile();              \n        }   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I keep geting <code>ENOENT (No such file or directory)</code> on <code>file.createNewFile();</code> </p>\n\n<p>I just want to create a simple txt file nested in 2 subfolders on my SDcard...</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file","text","input","char"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12885731,"title":"Appending characters onto string","body":"<p>I am trying to write code to import all characters (including spaces) of a given text file into a single string for analysis.

What seems to be the problem is how the program reads the files from the folder filled with tiles (png files) and place them in the HashMap.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for when I place the Tile Objects in the HashMap:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static HashMap&lt;Integer, Tile&gt; getTiles(String path) throws IOException {\n    HashMap&lt;Integer, Tile&gt; temp = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    File folder = new File(path);\n    Tile tile;\n    int counter = 0;\n    for(File file : folder.listFiles()) {\n        if(file.isFile()) {\n            try {\n                if(file.getCanonicalPath().endsWith(\".png\")) {\n                    tile = new Tile(file.getName(),ImageIO.read(file));\n                    temp.put(counter, tile);\n                    counter++;\n                }\n            } catch(IOException ioe) {\n                System.out.println(\"Picture number \" + counter + \" could \"\n                        + \"not be saved in the hashmap: \\n\"\n                        + ioe.getMessage());\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is the Output when I do a toString() on the HashMap:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Tiles: (0,0.png)(1,1.png)(2,10.png)(3,100.png)....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how after tile 1.png it starts counting 10, then 100, then 101, then 102...then when it reaches 112 it starts counting like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(112,2.png)(113,20.png)(114,200.png)(115,201.png)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is a total of 220 Tiles in this folder, (counting tile 0.png).\nI clearly see what the problem is, but not how I fix it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file","exception","io","fileinputstream"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12875546,"title":"File not found error for .txt file but not .m3u?","body":"<p>I'm testing some java code I'm working on for a school project and I'm unable to create a new file representing a txt file but am able to make one for an .m3u file.

It copies the device descriptor structure in cache, including its <em>serial number</em>, a unique identifier to otherwise identical devices.</li>\n<li><strong>When a device is removed</strong>, my program is notified by <code>usb_device_removed_cb()</code>. It cannot rely on libusbhost device structure since the kernel has already freed it, including the (precious) <em>serial number</em>. Thus it recalls the cached device structure to retrieve the serial number of the device that has been unplugged. It does this by comparing <code>dev_name</code> provided by <code>usb_device_removed_cb()</code> .</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So far, everything is fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now when a device is added</strong>, I would like to make a symlink from the device file to some other location. For instance <code>/dev/ttyBT0 -&gt; /dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Why? My program must ensure that <code>/dev/ttyBT0</code> is <em>bound</em> to a specific usb device, identified by its serial number. The symlink should remain consistent after plug/unplug/reboot events.  That symlink numbering must remain consistent, even if the standard device file changes its own numbering (<code>/dev/ttyBT0 -&gt; /dev/ttyUSB5</code>). To do so I need to programmatically (in C, bionic libc) get the device file at plug time. <strong>libusbhost</strong> does not seem to provide an api for that, although the info is available in the usb serial driver.

I'm really confused what is possibly can cause this? is it a problem from the C# downloading method? is it a problem from the md5 function it self? any inputs would be appreciated...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: a method to calculate md5 checksum</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static string GetMD5HashFromFile(string filename)\n{\n    using (var md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider())\n    {\n        var buffer = md5.ComputeHash(File.ReadAllBytes(filename));\n        var sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffer.Length; i++)\n        {\n            sb.Append(buffer[i].ToString(\"x2\"));\n        }\n        return sb.ToString();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["file","unix","rename"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":45,"score":-2,"question_id":12789212,"title":"Rename files by adding 10 - Unix","body":"<p>I have some files which are named as follows :</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc21pqr.txt\nabc22pqr.txt\nabc23pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on till</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc1000pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to take the number between \"abc\" and \"pqr\", add 10 to that number and rename the files :</p>\n\n<p>So my output filenames should be :</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc31pqr.txt\nabc32pqr.txt\nabc33pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on till</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc1010pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I do this using a Unix one-liner ? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["unix","file","renaming"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":448,"score":0,"question_id":1279047,"title":"Renaming multiple files: mv changing_part_footer.php changed_part_footer.php","body":"<p>I have files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>hallo_flower.php\nhallo_house.php\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to rename them to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tjena_flower.php\ntjena_house.php\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","file","local","assets"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4466,"score":2,"question_id":4734928,"title":"Unable to access Android assets (and no post or tutorial works for me), please help!","body":"<p>I'm facing a kind of curse about asset accessing with Android.

Actually I'm wondering what is the best technique on doing this. Because when I compared my work with my classmate, our logic are very different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>You see, our teacher asked us to do a simple student list system where users can add, edit and delete records. And he required us to make a file to save all the records so that we can access it the next time we use the program.</p>\n\n<p>My solution to this problem is before the program open its menu, i read all the records inside and save it in an array[]. In doing so, i could manipulate all the records. Then before the user exits the program, I save it on the same file and overwrite all the records on it.</p>\n\n<p>My classmate's solution is like this. When she adds a record, she access the file and append the data, when she edits a record, she access the file and edit the particular record, and when she deletes a record she access the file and deletes the record. So what she did is for every function she made, she's accessing the file.</p>\n\n<p>Both of our work is of course, possible to code.  But I am wondering, which is more efficient and effective to use if we are dealing with thousands or millions of records. Or are there other solutions better than what we did.

Basically I get a lot many duplicate files with different timestamps in my /tmp/ directory.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way that on every load of that page, all the existing instances of the files in that folder get deleted and a fresh batch of files are ready for download.

I'm a noob. I've completed multiple tutorials on how to develop themes. The theme that I'm currently working on has a problem with page competition I think. I'm building it on MAMP (if that's important). There is not much to this new theme right now. I just started and made all the template files I thought I'd need. Everything except \"index.php\" and \"style.css\" is blank. There is nothing in the functions file either. All the information for the header and footer and menu are currently just in \"index.php\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> When I include the file \"page.php\" in the theme folder, nothing loads on the page. And I don't mean just visually. None of the elements from the templates appear at all on the page. I have \"index.php\" in the theme folder as well. When \"page.php\" is removed from the folder, the theme loads everything just as it should. It is my understanding, according to the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress Hierarchy</a> that the index is called before the page template. I do plan on using pages. So it seems to me that \"page.php\" is competing with index.php and breaking the template.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question:</strong> Is \"page.php\" a competitor to \"index.php\" and how can I fix it so that it is not breaking my theme? Why might it do this on my theme and not on others?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I've Tried:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copied the contents of \"index.php\" into \"page.php\". The theme then loaded as expected but I anticipate this causing problems down the line.</li>\n<li>Leaving page template blank with index template full of code produces nothing. Leaving index blank with page full of code results in the theme loading.</li>\n<li>Copied \"page.php\" from another theme. Theme broke. Copied index from another theme. Still broken.</li>\n<li>Changed CSS just to make sure I didn't have any CSS that was causing these elements not to appear. Again though, they don't even show up when I use firebug or view source.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What I've Read:</strong> I've done my homework to try an resolve the issue without having to ask another question on stack but I can't seem to find anyone else with this same problem (which only makes me think it's probably something obvious that I'm doing wrong but since I'm a noob I missed it or something).

And I was wondering how likely it is for individual lines to fail to write?,  assuming the file is created properly/ accessed properly for the first line?\nand i guess secondly if this is likely to be a problem, is there any 'best practice' I should be aware of to easy(or eliminate) the problem.</p>\n\n<p>code below which i call for each row in the batch that needs writing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void WriteRow(CsvRow row)\n    {\n        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n        bool firstColumn = true;\n        foreach (string value in row)\n        {\n            // Add separator if this isn't the first value\n            if (!firstColumn)\n                builder.Append(',');\n            // Implement special handling for values that contain comma or quote\n            // Enclose in quotes and double up any double quotes\n            if (value.IndexOfAny(new char[] { '\"', ',' }) != -1)\n                builder.AppendFormat(\"\\\"{0}\\\"\", value.Replace(\"\\\"\", \"\\\"\\\"\"));\n            else\n                builder.Append(value);\n            firstColumn = false;\n        }\n        row.LineText = builder.ToString();\n        WriteLine(row.LineText);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","file"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":81,"score":0,"question_id":12684563,"title":"Read specific data from text file","body":"<p>I have a text file as follows(it is having more than hundered thousands of lines):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Header\nAGROUP1\nADATA1|0000\nADATA2|0001\nADATA3|0002\nD0000|TNE\nD0001|TNE\nD0002|TNE\nAGROUP2\nADATA1|0000\nADATA2|0001\nADATA3|0002\nD0000|TNE\nD0001|TNE\nD0002|TNE\nAGROUP3\nADATA1|0000\nADATA2|0001\nADATA3|0002\nD0000|TNE\nD0001|TNE\nD0002|TNE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Infact it has more than hundered thousands lines of code.</p>\n\n<p>I need to read data based on group\nFor example in a method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void ReadData(string strGroup)\n{\n    if(strGroup == \"AGROUP2)\n       //Read from the text file starting from line  \"AGROUP2\" to \"AGROUP3\"(i.e lines under AGROUP2)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What i have tried is</p>\n\n<pre><code> public void ReadData(string strGroup)\n    {\n             bool start = false;\n             while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n                    {\n                        if (line == strGroup &amp;&amp; line.Length == 5)\n                            start = true;\n                        else if (line.Length == 5)\n                            start = false;\n                        if(start)\n                            yield return line;\n                    }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is working fine, Performance wise, it takes longer since my text file is a very very huge file....There is if condition on every line in the method.</p>\n\n<p>IS the a better way to do this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["file","grep","diff","filetree"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12686830,"title":"get a list of files that are different between two filetrees","body":"<p>I'm comparing two very large filesystems (to do with a migration) and diff -qr was great but now since the users have been using the new location the files have changed.

Thanks in advance.\nHere is what I have so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char instruction[29][ 33 ];\nint i,run;\n\ni = 0;\nrun = 1;\n\nFILE *instPtr;\n\n\n/* LOADING INSTRUCTIONS FROM FILE INTO \"instruction\" ARRAY*/\n\n\nif ( ( instPtr = fopen(\"MIPSinstructions.txt\", \"r\") ) == NULL ) {\n    printf(\"File could not be opened\\n\");\n} // end if\n\nelse {\n    fscanf( instPtr, \"%s\", instruction[0]);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", instruction[0]);\n    while (!feof( instPtr ) ){\n        i++;\n\n        fscanf( instPtr, \"%s\", instruction[i]);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", instruction[i]);\n\n\n    }\n    fclose( instPtr );\n\n    i = 0;          // Reset the counter\n\n   } //end else\n\nreturn 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","file","file-io"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":0,"question_id":9609914,"title":"Music and Text in the Same File C#","body":"<p>If I wanted to have one file, with both an Mp3 track and a text component, how could I accomplish this in C#?</p>\n\n<p>Specific: I am creating a Guitar Hero Clone, and want one file with both the actual sound (an MP3) and the note chart (which I read as text).

However, I'm now stuck with a 'basic' problem.</p>\n\n<h2>Context</h2>\n\n<p>The website I'm building is an interface for scientific code: people fills-in a form and submit it. The data (written in a file inside a shared folder) is then being processed by the code, running as a daemon in the background (the code has no link with the website, excepts this shared folder and a JSONRPC link between <code>code-&gt;website</code>).\nThe code generates files and images that I would like to make available to the website users (ie. returning them back the results they asked for).\nWhen a job is finished, the code 'push' the results to the website using a JSONRPC service link, which works perfectly. The results are in a folder with a generated name which have basically the following structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_folder_name/\n        file1.txt\n        file2.csv\n        file3.xls\n        image1.png\n        image2.png\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>The current implementation (not working properly)</h2>\n\n<p>Currently I have 3 DBs:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Job database\ndb.define_table(\"job\",\n    Field('owner', 'string', length=60, required=True, writable=True, readable=True),\n    Field('uniq_id', \"string\", length=60, required=True, unique=True, writable=False, readable=True))\n\n# Result database\ndb.define_table(\"result\",\n    Field(\"job\", \"reference job\"),\n    Field(\"x\", \"integer\", default=1),\n    Field(\"y\", \"integer\", default=0),\n    Field(\"z\", \"integer\", default=0),\n    Field(\"data\", \"string\", length=500),\n    Field(\"message\", \"string\", length=200))\n\n# File database\ndb.define_table(\"file\",\n    Field(\"job\", \"reference job\"),\n    Field(\"file\", \"upload\"),\n    Field(\"isimage\", \"boolean\", default=False))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the code 'push' the results, some modules in Web2py create the entry in the 'result' db, and entries in the 'files' db associated to the job.\nSince I did not find a way to make files (already on the filesystem) available to Web2py without it copying to the upload folder, I currently store the files like that (in a module):</p>\n\n<pre><code>stream = open(os.path.join(directory, _file), 'rb')\ncurrent.db.file.insert(job=jid, file=current.db.file.file.store(stream, _file), isimage=isimg)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, when I want to create a view with the images, I do (in a module):</p>\n\n<pre><code>rows = current.db((current.db.file.job==jid) &amp; (current.db.file.isimage==True)).select()\nfor row in rows:\n    div.append(I(_src=URL(c=\"default\", f=\"download\", args=os.path.join(directory, row.file)), _width=\"500\", _height=\"500\"))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and in the view: `{{=div}}``</p>\n\n<h2>Problems</h2>\n\n<p>This is just not working... The source code of the displayed page is like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;i height=\"500\" src=\"/mycode/default/download//path/to/directory/file.file.9b7d3a0367de0843.6d732d72732e706e67.png\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I type this URL in the address bar, the file download properly, but otherwise the image is not displayed on the webpage.\nAlso, I have to give the path of the file, even if Web2py did copy the file into 'upload' folder (with its new safe ugly name:)), otherwise the link is just not working.\nSo: no image displayed, plus the files are copied into 'upload' folder anyway :(</p>\n\n<p>I'm lost, and dont see how to fix this. (I've tried also to add the request object when building the image URL, and also tried a custom download function... none worked so far). </p>\n\n<h2>EDIT (SOLUTION)</h2>\n\n<p>Well, there is an obvious bug in my code that I've missed: images tag helper is not <code>I</code>, but <code>IMG</code> :) Simple mistake arising from the confusion with the <code>I</code> tag used in twitter bootstrap for icons... So that solves the display issue.\nFor streaming files without copying them in the upload folder (ie. not using an <code>upload</code> field in the DB), <strong>rochacbruno</strong> (many thanks to him) has put me on the right track.

Asking the user to enter the full path to your file to make certain you are processing the correct file.\n2. Modify your code/add a method to display the contents of the file in reverse order. You do not need to reverse the characters on each line but simply out put the lines of the file in reverse order.\na. Read the content of the file into an ArrayList and then traverse the ArrayList.\n3. Finally, copy the contents of the file to another file. You will need to loop through the file and write each line to a new file.\nI also want to create a new exception, FileMissingException which will extend FileNotFoundException. You will need to create a separate class to hold your new exception.\nModify your code to catch the FileNotFoundException and throw a FileMissingException.

Also I figured since I'm passing a url instead of list of files, I'll need to remove the <code>for()</code> loop from the <code>doProcess()</code> function which would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>function doProcess(f)\n{\n    var o=[];\n\n           var reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = (function(theFile) {\n        return function(e) {\n            gCtx.clearRect(0, 0, gCanvas.width, gCanvas.height);\n\n            qrcode.decode(e.target.result);\n        };\n        })(f);\n        reader.readAsDataURL(f); \n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this doesn't work too :( </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have an input file to which a QR image file is supplied with.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input type=\"file\" onchange=\"doProcess(this.files)\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>doProcess function</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>function doProcess(f)\n{\n    var o=[];\n\n    for(var i =0;i&lt;f.length;i++)\n    {\n        var reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = (function(theFile) {\n        return function(e) {\n            gCtx.clearRect(0, 0, gCanvas.width, gCanvas.height);\n\n            qrcode.decode(e.target.result);\n        };\n        })(f[i]);\n        reader.readAsDataURL(f[i]); \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This function works perfectly. No problems there. The purpose of this function is to decode a QR image. Now out of sheer interest and curiosity, I'm planning to do something different - <strong>remove the need to browse to the image file manually</strong>. This brings me to a few queries:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is it possible for <code>doProcess(f)</code> to perform the same actions when supplied with an image URL instead of a file? At present <code>f</code> parameter is a file. What will happen if <code>f</code> parameter is a URL (<strong>for ex: doProcess(http://www.abc.com/abc.jpg)</strong>)? I realize there are other support functions inside <code>doProcess()</code> also being called to complete the decoding process but I'm assuming those will act accordingly to the type of data being passed through <code>doProcess</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>If <code>f</code> parameter is an image file (browsed on local computer and selected) instead of image URL, what data type will <code>f</code> be? I'm guessing it will be an array or in some raw binary form.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My intention is to study the process and know what exactly is happening behind the scenes. By using the 'browse' function, the QR image is being decoded successfully.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, what will happen if I pass the location of the image stored as the argument instead of a file?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["file","unix","delete"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":12404414,"title":"How to delete unix files from a directory with common name except the latest one","body":"<p>I have multiple files in the name format as mentioned below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ABC_Report_v-20120801_1741.csv</li>\n<li>ABC_Report_v-20120801_1741.csv</li>\n<li>ABC_Report_v-20120907_1254.csv</li>\n<li>XYZ_Dashboard_v-20120802_1804.csv</li>\n<li>XYZ_Dashboard_v-20120806_2031.csv</li>\n<li>XYZ_Dashboard_v-20120802_1946.csv</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I want to delete all the files except the latest one like <code>ABC_Report_v-20120907_1254.csv</code> and <code>XYZ_Dashboard_v-20120802_1946.csv</code>\nThe multiple files with the same name before <code>_v</code> characters should be removed keeping the latest one only.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","file","web-applications","client-side"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":16,"up_vote_count":64,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9151,"score":64,"question_id":3665115,"title":"Create a file in memory for user to download, not through server","body":"<p>Is there any way I can create a text file on the client side and prompt the user to download it, without any interaction with the server?\nI know I can't write directly to their machine (security and all), but can I create and prompt them to save it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","file","stream","append","seek"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":946,"score":5,"question_id":6427698,"title":"Write to the middle of an existing binary file c++","body":"<p>I'm trying to open a binary file for writing without erasing the content.

I also know that this can't be a Kerberos \"double-hop\" issue because I can connect to a remote SQL server (from the web server) and pass the Windows Authenticated credentials through just fine and return results from a query.</p>\n\n<p>I am using <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Process Monitor</a> on the web server to figure out which credentials are being passed over to the remote share. When I look at the capture where the ACCESS DENIED is showing, it gives me this description...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Desired Access: Read Data/List Directory, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Directory, Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Open For Backup, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a, Impersonating: DOMAIN\\username</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where DOMAIN\\username is my impersonated username from the web server.</p>\n\n<p>Process Monitor is also showing that NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE is the user on the web server that is making the request, which makes me think that the web server is NOT, in fact, passing over the impersonated user to read the remote file share. It's almost like there is a \"double hop\" issue for remote file share access specifically.</p>\n\n<p>I have also configured the web server to \"Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)\". Again, this can't be a double-hop issue if I can access a remote SQL server from the web server, or can it? Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated, I have spent 2 days looking at possible solutions and nothing works. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","file","post","upload","curl"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":10,"up_vote_count":16,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5716,"score":16,"question_id":3085990,"title":"POST a file string using cURL in PHP?","body":"<p>I was wondering if it is possible to post a file - along with other form data - when the file is just a string?</p>\n\n<p>I know that you can post a file that is already on the filesystem by prefixing the filepath with \"@\".</p>\n\n<p>However I'd like to bypass creating a temporary file and send just the file as a string, but I am unsure how to construct the request using cURL in PHP.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $postFields = array(\n        'otherFields'   =&gt; 'Yes'\n        ,'filename'     =&gt; 'my_file.csv'\n        ,'data'         =&gt; 'comma seperated content'\n    );\n\n    $options = array(\n        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER  =&gt; true\n        ,CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER =&gt; false\n        ,CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST =&gt; 1\n        ,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS     =&gt; $postFields\n        ,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER     =&gt; array(\n            'Content-type: multipart/form-data'\n        )\n    );\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","database","performance","file","hosting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":12304684,"title":"Pull from MySQL vs pull from filesystem","body":"<p>If there were 1 million concurrent users visiting a website viewing different pages, which is going to cause a higher server load (i.e., slow down the sever)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pull from MySQL</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GET index.php?=page_id=1</li>\n<li>GET index.php?=page_id=2</li>\n<li>GET index.php?=page_id=etc...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pull static page from filesystem</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GET page_1.html</li>\n<li>GET page_2.html</li>\n<li>GET page_etc...html</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","file","file-upload","data","html-input"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":136,"score":0,"question_id":12281775,"title":"Get data from file input in JQuery","body":"<p>I actually have a file input and I would like to retrieve the Base64 data of the file.</p>\n\n<p>I tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('input#myInput')[0].files[0] \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to retrieve the data.

My problem is that I don't know how best to read the file a group at a time. All the groups are of arbitrary, unknown size. I have considered two ways:</p>\n\n<p>1) Scan the file using a <code>BufferedReader</code>, accumulating the lines from a group in a String or array. Whenever a line is encountered that belongs to a new group, hold that line in a temporary variable, process the previous group. Clear the accumulator, add the temporary and then continue reading the new group starting from the second line.</p>\n\n<p>2) Scan the file using a <code>BufferedReader</code>, whenever a line is encountered that belongs to a new group, somehow reset the cursor so that when <code>readLine()</code> is next invoked it starts from the first line of the group instead of the second. I have looked into <code>mark()</code> and <code>reset()</code> but these require knowing the byte-position of the start of the line.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to go with (1) at the moment, but I would be very grateful if someone could suggest a method that smells less.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","file","bash","shell","copy"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12186896,"title":"copy contents of a file starting from regex word to end of the file","body":"<p>I want to copy a content of a file starting from word (searched word/line) to the end of the file.</p>\n\n<p>Example:\nFile1:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this is a sample text for file1 in PA\nthis is a sample text for file1 in CA\nthis is a sample text for file1 in CT\nthis is a sample text for file1 in IL\nthis is a sample text for file1 in MI\nend of the file.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to copy contents to file2 from line that has \"CT\" till the end of the file.\nOutput :\nFile2</p>\n\n<pre><code>this is a sample text for file1 in CT\nthis is a sample text for file1 in IL\nthis is a sample text for file1 in MI\nend of the file.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","apache","file","upload","compression"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":86,"score":2,"question_id":12190230,"title":"is it dangerous to zip/unzip unknown uploaded files on server that may contain anything? even viruses?","body":"<p>i am trying to implement a user system (php, apache) where the user can upload several files and download a zipped version of them.
