The problem is that I want to call this method only once, when application starts and deny access to files to ensure that nobody changed their contents while my program is working. </p>\n\n<p>I use the following approach.

I thought a temporary iframe would be a good idea - but simply no idea how to implement such a thing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"uploadform\"&gt;\n            &lt;form id = \"uploadpicform\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" action=\"uploadpic.php\" method=\"POST\"&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt;Photo: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"photo\"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Caption:&lt;/p&gt; My &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n                   &lt;input type=\"submit\" class=\"large blue button\" value=\"Add\"&gt; \n            &lt;/form&gt;\n            &lt;script&gt;\n            // wait for the DOM to be loaded\n            $(document).ready(function() {\n                // bind 'myForm' and provide a simple callback function\n                $('#uploadpicform').ajaxForm(function() {\n                $(\"#hideuploadbutton\").hide();\n                $(\"#uploadbutton\").show();\n                $(\"#uploadform\").hide();\n                });\n            });             \n            &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What that does at the moment, is submits the form, with no notice, hides the upload button and shows an open upload button to start the process again. I figure there must be some sort of 'add iframe' or 'print php variable from the other page' option or something.</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any help, thanks a bunch!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":5,"question_id":13204656,"title":"Too many open file error, java.io.FileNotFoundException","body":"<p>In my program I have loop that scans a bunch of files and reads their content.

I'm reading in a file ( a small exe of 472 KB ) with FileInputStream, i plan to send the file torugh RMI connection, and i had an idea, where i could show the upload's % based on how much have i already sent trough compared to the overall length of the file.</p>\n\n<p>First i tried it out locally and i couldn't get it work. Here is an example, what i was doing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>FileInputStream fileData = new FileInputStream(file);\nreads = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\nbuffers = new ArrayList&lt;byte[]&gt;();\nint i = 0;\nwhile ( (read = fileData.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n      System.out.println(\"Run : \" + (i + 1));\n      outstreamA.write(buffer, 0, read);\n      reads.add(read);\n      buffers.add(buffer);\n      outstreamB.write(this.buffers.get(i), 0, this.reads.get(i));\n      i = i + 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This two FileOutputStream creates two files ( same ones just with different name ), works fine. However, when i'm not using fileData.read() but any other for / while, it just dosen't work. It creates the exact same file ( length is exactly the same ) but my Window cannot run the exe, i get an error message :\n\"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running...\".</p>\n\n<p>This is how i tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffers.size(); ++i) {\n  i = 0;\n//while ( (read = fileData2.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {\n  while ( i &lt; size) {\n      System.out.println(\"Run#2 : \" + (i + 1));\n      outstreamC.write(this.buffers.get(i), 0, this.reads.get(i));\n      i = i + 1;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>fileData2 is the same as fileData. If i work with fileData2.read(buffer), outstreamC creates a working file aswell. </p>\n\n<p>It dosen't matter if i run with for till the list's size, or till \"size\" which equals the time i entered the first while. There is something missing, and i cannot figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>The weird thing is, outstreamB creates a working file, yet outstreamC cannot, but they working with the exact same items.</p>\n\n<p>Originally i was planning to pass the \"read\" and \"buffer\" each time i entered the first while trough RMI connection, and put everything together on the other side, after all the parts arrived, but now my plan is kinda dead. Anyone has maybe an idea, how could i solve this, or achieve something similar to be able to send files trough RMI?</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,\nMihaly</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","file"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13203587,"title":"Java - Converting a text area to a string","body":"<p>I am having a little trouble here, I want to convert a text area into a string, so i can store it in a new string and pass it to a txt file.

However, PHP's <code>dirname()</code> will return only \"http://example.com\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if it thinks that \"blog\" is an extension-less file, if that exists, but I can't really find a solution.</p>\n\n<h2>Things I've Tried</h2>\n\n<p>I first tried getting the extension of the URL using this quick method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$url = 'http://example.com/index.php';\n$file_extension = end(explode('.', $filename));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I would check if the extension existed using PHP <code>empty()</code>. If the extension exists, that means that a filename was entered after the folder, such as \"http://example.com/path/file.html\", and <code>dirname()</code> is perfect. If the extension doesn't exist, no file was entered and the last item in the path is a folder, so it is already \"the base\".</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of simply \"http://example.com/path/\", the above would return \".com/path/\" as the file extension, which we all know doesn't exist. In this case, I would use the <code>dirname()</code> function and cut off \"/path/\".</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Taking the extension of <code>basename($url)</code> won't work because if the user enters \"http://example.com\" <code>basename()</code> returns \"example.com\", the extension for which is supposedly \n\".com\"</p>\n\n<h3>Hopefully, someone has had the same problem and knows the solution.

The examples I have seen use the WebMatrix File Helper (File Helper? Is that right? Oh well, it's a helper of some kind that auto plots the html necessary for the input=type\"file\" field).

Sorry if that's a little TMI, just trying to be thorough, but to refine the question:  I don't know enough about file uploading to know how to work with the uploaded data that well yet.  I tried researching this information, but I didn't find any information that seemed pertinent to me (actually, I didn't find much useful information on input type=\"file\", or the FileUpload method, at all, really).  </p>\n\n<p>Would it be better to use input type=\"file\" id=\"pic1id\"? Is there something that I can use such as Request.Files[\"pic1id\"] that could get the file from the id of the input element? Or does the program simply take all uploaded files, stick them in a logistical group somewhere waiting to be called by index like this: \"Request.Files[0]\".  If so, what order does the index get put in? Do I need to use Request.Files.Count to test how many have been uploaded before I begin working with the data?</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I want separate input type=\"file\" fields (whether plotted by the helper or not).  I do not want to accept multiple files in one input (mainly because of a lack of knowledge, e.g., I am afraid I won't know how to work with the data).  So far, the plan is that the separate input type=\"file\" fields will be within the divs that get hidden/unhidden upon scrolling through pictures, so each picture (space) will have its own input type=\"file\" field.  The hiding and unhiding of divs, (the one) picture being displayed, storing and receiving binary data from the database, and clicking through the picture placeholders all function great.  Pretty much I just need to know how to work with more than one uploaded picture at a time for storage in their individual database \"image\" fields.</p>\n\n<p>Any examples of the syntax I need to use will be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry so many questions, but I just couldn't find much useful information on this at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to any who try to help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","file","cgi","open"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13122250,"title":"CGI c file open","body":"<p>I have created a cgi file in c.

It is because perl is generating the output file in unix format which has a control ^M character at the end of each line. so to convert the unix format file to linux format file, i need to use a command call \"unix2dos\" which is not available in windows.

Each variable will be named \"block_NNN\" from 1 to 40 and will contain a struct with fields <em>frames</em> and <em>blockNo</em>. Field <em>frames</em> contains a 480x240x65 sequence of uint8 imagedata (here just random data generated using <strong>randi</strong>). Field <em>blockNo</em> contains the block number.</p>\n\n<p>Remark: <em>In the real script (that I have yet to finish) I will be doing the above at total of 370 times, converting a total of 108GB of raw data. Which is why I am concerned with the following.</em></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, first I define some general variables:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% some sizes for dummy data and loops:\nnum_blockCount = 40;\nnum_blockLength = 65;\nnum_frameHeight = 480;\nnum_frameWidth = 240;\n</pre>\n\n<p>I then generate some dummy code that has shape and size identical to the actual raw data:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% generate empty struct:\nstu_data2disk = struct();\n\n% loop over blocks:\nfor num_k = 1:num_blockCount\n\n   % generate block-name:\n   temp_str_blockName = sprintf('block_%03u', num_k);\n\n   % generate temp struct for current block:\n   temp_stu_value = struct();\n   temp_stu_value.frames = randi( ...\n      [0 255], ...\n      [num_frameHeight num_frameWidth num_blockLength], ...\n      'uint8' ...\n   );\n   temp_stu_value.blockNo = num_k;\n\n   % using dynamic field names:\n   stu_data2disk.(sprintf('block_%03u', num_k)) = temp_stu_value;\n\nend\n</pre>\n\n<p>I now have all my random test-data in a struct <strong>stu_data2disk</strong>. Now I would like to save the data using one of two possible methods.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try the simple one first:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% save data (simple):\ndisp('Save data the simple way:')\ntic;\nsave converted.mat -struct stu_data2disk -v7.3;\ntoc;\n</pre>\n\n<p>The file is written without problems (286MB). The output is:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSave data the simple way:\nElapsed time is 14.004449 seconds.\n</pre>\n\n<p>OK - then I remembered that I would like to follow the save-procedure over the 40 blocks. Thus instead of the above I loop over the blocks and append them in sequence:</p>\n\n<pre>\n% save to file, using append:\ndisp('Save data using -append:')\ntic;\nfor num_k = 1:num_blockCount\n\n   % generate block-name:\n   temp_str_blockName = sprintf('block_%03u', num_k);\n\n   temp_str_appendToggle = '';\n   if (num_k > 1)\n      temp_str_appendToggle = '-append';\n   end\n\n   % generate save command:\n   temp_str_saveCommand = [ ...\n      'save ', ...\n      'converted_append.mat ', ...\n      '-struct stu_data2disk ', temp_str_blockName, ' '...\n      temp_str_appendToggle, ' ', ...\n      '-v7.3', ...\n      ';' ...\n   ];\n\n   % evaluate save command:\n   eval(temp_str_saveCommand);\n\nend\ntoc;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And again the file saves nicely (286MB). The output is:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSave data using -append:\nElapsed time is 0.956968 seconds.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Interestingly the append-method is much faster? <strong>My question is why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Output from <strong><code>dir converted*.mat</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre>\n09-02-2011  20:38       300,236,392 converted.mat\n09-02-2011  20:37       300,264,316 converted_append.mat\n               2 File(s)    600,500,708 bytes\n</pre>\n\n<p>The files are not identical in size. And a test with <strong>fc</strong> in windows 7 revealed ... well many binary differences. Perhaps the data was shifted a bit - thus this tells us nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Does someone have an idea what is going on here? Is the appended file using a much more optimized data-structure perhaps? Or maybe windows has cached the file and makes access to it much faster?</p>\n\n<p>I made the effort of test-reading from the two files as well.

I believe I have read somewhere that HDF5 should optimized in this very way... though cannot be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Other details to note:</p>\n\n<p>The behavior is very systemic as we see in Andrew's answer below. It also seems to be quite important as to whether or not you run these things in a local scope of a function or in the \"global\" of an m-script. My first results were from an m-script where files were written to the current directory. I can still only reproduce the 1-second write for -7.3 in the m-script. The function-calls add some overhead appearently.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,\nOle</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","file","directory","split"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":90,"score":-1,"question_id":13048366,"title":"How to split directory path components in string in java","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6174182/how-to-split-the-string-in-java\">how to split the string in java</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>FileSystemView fsv = FileSystemView.getFileSystemView();\nFile[] roots = fsv.getRoots();\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; roots.length; i++)\n{\n  System.out.println(\"Root: \" + roots[i]);\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Home directory: \" + fsv.getHomeDirectory());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Root: C:\\Users\\RS\\Desktop\nHome directory: C:\\Users\\RS\\Desktop</p>\n\n<p>I want cut the root or Home Directory components like \nString C, Users, RS, Desktop</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","file","delete","windows-services"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":48,"score":-1,"question_id":13048261,"title":"Windows service file delete","body":"<p>Windows service </p>\n\n<pre><code> protected override void OnStart(string[] args)       \n {\n }\n\n //my method\n public void silsene(string yol)\n {\n     System.IO.DirectoryInfo myDirInfo = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(yol);\n\n     foreach (System.IO.FileInfo file in myDirInfo.GetFiles())\n     {\n         file.Delete();\n     }\n\n     foreach (System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir in myDirInfo.GetDirectories())\n     {\n         dir.Delete(true);\n     }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how windows form my method call</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","file","upload","directory"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13046103,"title":"ruby on rails how to add files to a folder for direct use","body":"<p>I want to add some <code>.c files</code>  <strong>manually</strong> in my website for others to be able to see them with a direct link in their browser...</p>\n\n<p>Where do i add these files and how can i link to them in a view file?</p>\n\n<p>Do i simply create a folder in the assets or in the root of the site and link manually like</p>\n\n<p><code>http://www.mysite.com/path/to/file</code>?</p>\n\n<p>is it possible to make this use routes <strong>like</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>this_route_path()</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["file","validation","upload","struts2","size"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":95,"score":0,"question_id":12900045,"title":"Struts2 Upload File, validating size and content type file before send file","body":"<p>I have a problem with Struts 2 and its file upload interceptor.

Most of our customers have a Dutch Windows installation and also most of them have their Regional Settings set to Dutch (nl-NL), implying the . (period) for grouping and the , (comma) as decimal separator.</p>\n\n<p>Out of our almost 10,000 customers, only ONE (1) had a problem, the cause of which we identified as originating in a call to SHGetFileInfo to get a (small) icon for a file. Relevant statements in the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We assessed that - at the particular PC of this customer - before the (first) call to SHGetFileInfo the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture was (nl-NL), as expected, but immediately after the call the CurrentCulture had switched to (en-US), which obviously caused problems elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Pausing the code at that point and inspecting the Configuration Panel, the Regional Settings THERE were still Dutch (nl-NL). Also, no SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged (or -Changing) events were caught in the code. After stopping and restarting the program, the CurrentCulture in the program was again Dutch (nl-NL) - until the first SHGetFileInfo call.</p>\n\n<p>In a practical sense we solved the issue by resetting the CurrentCulture if necessary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Private Declare Unicode Function SHGetFileInfo0 Lib \"Shell32.dll\" Alias \"SHGetFileInfoW\" (pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n\n  Private Shared Function SHGetFileInfo(pszPath As String, dwFileAttributes As UInteger, ByRef psfi As SHFILEINFO, cbSizeFileInfo As UInteger, uFlags As UInteger) As IntPtr\n\n    Dim ciBefore As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n\n    Dim result As IntPtr = SHGetFileInfo0(pszPath, dwFileAttributes, psfi, cbSizeFileInfo, uFlags)\n\n    Dim ciAfter As System.Globalization.CultureInfo = Application.CurrentCulture\n    If (ciAfter.Name &lt;&gt; ciAfter.Name) OrElse (ciBefore IsNot ciAfter) Then\n      Application.CurrentCulture = ciBefore\n    End If\n\n    Return result\n  End Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the problem showed up only on that particular customer-PC, I had to analyze the issue on his PC , limiting my time to check things out. So, after solving the issue for him in the practical sense, I'm left with the unpleasant fact that I don't know how this could happen and my question, therefore, is: can anybody shed some light in this darkness?</p>\n\n<p>Additional information: the customer did not have this problem until a month ago. Recently he has started using (and presumably installed) DropBox and BoxSync. I have no knowledge of the internal workings of these, but as they also \"use files\" and their installations more or less coincide with the problem showing up, I do have suspicions that there may be a connection.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I've sufficiently stated the issue, but if more information is needed, I'll be glad to try and provide this.

I already have checks for whether the input is a folder and now I need to check whether the folder actually contains a .vm file. \nWhat I've done so far is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'pathname'\n\npn = Pathname.new(ARGV[0])\n\nif ARGV.size != 1\n    puts \"Proper usage is: ruby vmtranslator.rb file_directory\\file.vm \\nOR \\nruby vmtranslator.rb file_directory\\ where file_directory has multiple vm files test\".split(\"\\n\")\nelsif !pn.exist? &amp;&amp; !pn.directory?\n    puts \"Something is wrong with the file\"\n    puts \"Either try another file or check the file extension\"\nelsif pn.directory? &amp;&amp; pn.children(false).extname.include?('.vm')\n    puts \"this should print if Folder1 is the folder, but not if Folder2 is..\"\n    vm_file1 = File.open(\"OPEN FILES WITH .vm AS EXTENSION)\nelsif pn.exist? || pn.file?\n    puts \"this is right\"\n    vm_file = File.open(ARGV[0], \"r\")\n    asm_file = File.new(ARGV[0].sub('.vm', '.asm'), \"w\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what that should do is check whether there is only 1 argument first, if so, then it checks if it's a file or directory else it outputs an error, then what I'm doing is checking if it's a directory. If so, I need to check if the directory actually contains .vm files. I tried <code>pn.each_child {|f| f.extname == '.vm'}</code> but that only checks the first value before it returns true. Is there any easier way to check the whole array before returning true, other than just setting some boolean?</p>\n\n<p>Some of the code up there isn't done, I'm just asking if there is any way to check a directory for a file of a certain extension. I can't find anything with my searches so far.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","file"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":12946243,"title":"Anyone knows that the file values-sw580?","body":"<p>I find an strange file named <code>values-sw580</code> in my Android contact code .I don't know what is this for and why it calls this way.Anyone know about it ?:） tell me please.thanx.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","linux","file","unix","words"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":109,"score":0,"question_id":12942806,"title":"Remove rare words from a very large file","body":"<p>Given a very large text file, I want to remove all the words which occur only once in the file.

I've tried many different things to break the data into a separate project and just reference that instead through various methods, with not much luck.  My goal is so I can click run in eclipse for each project separately and they both load from the same data.</p>\n\n<p>When the project is finally built, there will be 3 jars (the two projects,+ a lib), which will be in the same directory with the xml and xsd folders.  So any file references to the XSD/XMLs are currently in the format like this: File file = new File(\"xml/pixtilemaps.xml\");</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't work in eclipse, but works during export because of the file structure is sound.  I tried using virtual folders in each of the projects, but it doesn't look like runtime references to relative files use the virtual folders in the way I was expecting.  I've tried adding each as a linked resource, added the project on the build path, etc, but whatever I do, it doesn't seem to treat the xml folder as a relative folder.  I get an error like : file:/F:/workspace/com.myoid.editor/xsd/pixtilemaps.xsd does not exist.  Because it takes it relative to the project. I've also tried to find a run configuration solution to this, but there is obviously something I'm not understanding to get this to work the way I want.  </p>\n\n<p>So in summary, have an xsd folder, xml folder in a 3rd eclipse project, that I want 1 and 2 to be able to access through relative file paths like File file = new File(\"xml/pixtilemaps.xml\");</p>\n\n<p><strong>How I fixed it:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay.. so.. maybe there is a better solution but this is what I came up with... In Eclipse under run configurations you can specify the working directory that the launch will run from.  So I put all xml/xsd in for both projects in the same \"working directory\".  In the run configuration for each project I point the working directory to the 3rd project, and viola, it works like I had expected.</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","file"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12885958,"title":"Failing creating a txt file with subfolders in Android","body":"<p>Fellow programmers.\nCuold you possibly take a look on this simple code frag and tell me what's wrong here?</p>\n\n<pre><code>        File dir = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/asteroids/modules\"); \n        File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/asteroids/modules/\" + fileName);             \n\n        if (!file.exists()) {     \n            dir.mkdir();\n            file.createNewFile();              \n        }   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I keep geting <code>ENOENT (No such file or directory)</code> on <code>file.createNewFile();</code> </p>\n\n<p>I just want to create a simple txt file nested in 2 subfolders on my SDcard...</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file","text","input","char"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12885731,"title":"Appending characters onto string","body":"<p>I am trying to write code to import all characters (including spaces) of a given text file into a single string for analysis.

What seems to be the problem is how the program reads the files from the folder filled with tiles (png files) and place them in the HashMap.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for when I place the Tile Objects in the HashMap:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static HashMap&lt;Integer, Tile&gt; getTiles(String path) throws IOException {\n    HashMap&lt;Integer, Tile&gt; temp = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    File folder = new File(path);\n    Tile tile;\n    int counter = 0;\n    for(File file : folder.listFiles()) {\n        if(file.isFile()) {\n            try {\n                if(file.getCanonicalPath().endsWith(\".png\")) {\n                    tile = new Tile(file.getName(),ImageIO.read(file));\n                    temp.put(counter, tile);\n                    counter++;\n                }\n            } catch(IOException ioe) {\n                System.out.println(\"Picture number \" + counter + \" could \"\n                        + \"not be saved in the hashmap: \\n\"\n                        + ioe.getMessage());\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is the Output when I do a toString() on the HashMap:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Tiles: (0,0.png)(1,1.png)(2,10.png)(3,100.png)....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how after tile 1.png it starts counting 10, then 100, then 101, then 102...then when it reaches 112 it starts counting like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(112,2.png)(113,20.png)(114,200.png)(115,201.png)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is a total of 220 Tiles in this folder, (counting tile 0.png).\nI clearly see what the problem is, but not how I fix it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file","exception","io","fileinputstream"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":0,"question_id":12875546,"title":"File not found error for .txt file but not .m3u?","body":"<p>I'm testing some java code I'm working on for a school project and I'm unable to create a new file representing a txt file but am able to make one for an .m3u file.

It copies the device descriptor structure in cache, including its <em>serial number</em>, a unique identifier to otherwise identical devices.</li>\n<li><strong>When a device is removed</strong>, my program is notified by <code>usb_device_removed_cb()</code>. It cannot rely on libusbhost device structure since the kernel has already freed it, including the (precious) <em>serial number</em>. Thus it recalls the cached device structure to retrieve the serial number of the device that has been unplugged. It does this by comparing <code>dev_name</code> provided by <code>usb_device_removed_cb()</code> .</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So far, everything is fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now when a device is added</strong>, I would like to make a symlink from the device file to some other location. For instance <code>/dev/ttyBT0 -&gt; /dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Why? My program must ensure that <code>/dev/ttyBT0</code> is <em>bound</em> to a specific usb device, identified by its serial number. The symlink should remain consistent after plug/unplug/reboot events.  That symlink numbering must remain consistent, even if the standard device file changes its own numbering (<code>/dev/ttyBT0 -&gt; /dev/ttyUSB5</code>). To do so I need to programmatically (in C, bionic libc) get the device file at plug time. <strong>libusbhost</strong> does not seem to provide an api for that, although the info is available in the usb serial driver.

I'm really confused what is possibly can cause this? is it a problem from the C# downloading method? is it a problem from the md5 function it self? any inputs would be appreciated...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: a method to calculate md5 checksum</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static string GetMD5HashFromFile(string filename)\n{\n    using (var md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider())\n    {\n        var buffer = md5.ComputeHash(File.ReadAllBytes(filename));\n        var sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffer.Length; i++)\n        {\n            sb.Append(buffer[i].ToString(\"x2\"));\n        }\n        return sb.ToString();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["file","unix","rename"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":45,"score":-2,"question_id":12789212,"title":"Rename files by adding 10 - Unix","body":"<p>I have some files which are named as follows :</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc21pqr.txt\nabc22pqr.txt\nabc23pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on till</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc1000pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to take the number between \"abc\" and \"pqr\", add 10 to that number and rename the files :</p>\n\n<p>So my output filenames should be :</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc31pqr.txt\nabc32pqr.txt\nabc33pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and so on till</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc1010pqr.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I do this using a Unix one-liner ? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["unix","file","renaming"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":447,"score":0,"question_id":1279047,"title":"Renaming multiple files: mv changing_part_footer.php changed_part_footer.php","body":"<p>I have files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>hallo_flower.php\nhallo_house.php\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to rename them to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tjena_flower.php\ntjena_house.php\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","file","local","assets"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4456,"score":2,"question_id":4734928,"title":"Unable to access Android assets (and no post or tutorial works for me), please help!","body":"<p>I'm facing a kind of curse about asset accessing with Android.

Everything is fine for a while until the moment when I have to input the answer; there, no matter what I put, even if it's right or wrong, it gives me the next error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\[User]\\Desktop\\lol.py\", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;\n    a=input(\"¿Sabes qué es?\") #\"Do you know the answer?\" #Here, you are supposed to type the answer to the riddle.\n  File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nNameError: name 'aguacate' is not defined #It is the correct answer BTW\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I <strong>know</strong> this problem generates when it starts to compare the answers, and I also <strong>KNOW</strong> that it's probably because I wrote it wrong... Sooo, any advice on how to do it right?</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks in advance</em></p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","file","streamreader","read-only"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":5,"up_vote_count":14,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9459,"score":14,"question_id":897796,"title":"How do I open an already opened file with a .net StreamReader?","body":"<p>I have some .csv files which I'm using as part of a test bench.

Actually I'm wondering what is the best technique on doing this. Because when I compared my work with my classmate, our logic are very different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>You see, our teacher asked us to do a simple student list system where users can add, edit and delete records. And he required us to make a file to save all the records so that we can access it the next time we use the program.</p>\n\n<p>My solution to this problem is before the program open its menu, i read all the records inside and save it in an array[]. In doing so, i could manipulate all the records. Then before the user exits the program, I save it on the same file and overwrite all the records on it.</p>\n\n<p>My classmate's solution is like this. When she adds a record, she access the file and append the data, when she edits a record, she access the file and edit the particular record, and when she deletes a record she access the file and deletes the record. So what she did is for every function she made, she's accessing the file.</p>\n\n<p>Both of our work is of course, possible to code.  But I am wondering, which is more efficient and effective to use if we are dealing with thousands or millions of records. Or are there other solutions better than what we did.
