Eclipse adds the project name and then the URL becomes <code>http://testproject.dev/testproject/index.php</code>.  </p>\n\n<p>This are my configurations:</p>\n\n<p>XAMPP\nhttpd.conf (c:\\xampp\\conf\\httpd.conf)</p>\n\n<pre><code># Virtual hosts\nInclude \"conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>httpd-vhosts.conf (c:\\xampp\\conf\\extra\\httpd-vhosts.conf)</p>\n\n<pre><code>NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1\n\n&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;\nDocumentRoot \"C:/xampp/htdocs/testproject\"\nServerName testproject.dev\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Windows 7\nWindows vhost file (C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts)</p>\n\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1 testproject.dev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Eclipse\n-> Preferences -> PHP Server</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tab \"Server\":  Name: \"Development_Server_Testproject\" URL: <code>http://testproject.dev</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Tab \"Path Mapping\": Path on server <code>http://testproject.dev</code> Path in workspace</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>/testproject</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","handler","stacked"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4,"score":0,"question_id":13287424,"title":"Costumed apache mod stacked on mod_jk","body":"<p>I am trying to put my costumed apache mod in c on top of the mod_jk.

It seems to suggest there is some bug in Tomcat 6 which was fixed in version 6.0.20, a slightly higher version than the one we're using. Unfortunately it doesn't mention what the issue itself was. I've <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/changelog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">had a look</a> at the Tomcat changelog, but can't see any likely candidates for a bug which could cause this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, on to my actual question, has anyone encountered a similar problem, and if so, what was the underlying issue and how did you resolve it?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any responses. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This appears to be some kind of problem with load balancing and Tomcat. If you bypass the load balancer and access Tomcat directly via the server IP address, the problem goes away. The strange thing is that this appears in both our staging environment, in which we use Apache/AJP1.3, and live, where we use Zeus. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: This turned out to be an issue with the clients firewall. It appears that they were.. er.. not being entirely truthful when they said that the knew definitely this was not a Firewall issue.</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","web2py"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13218303,"title":"web2py rocket or Apache","body":"<p>Web2py states in the home page 'including fast multi-threaded web server' and I have seen text that says the rocket server performs as well as Apache.

They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure\n# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  \n#\n# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many\n# of the server's control files begin with \"/\" (or \"drive:/\" for Win32), the\n# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with \"/\", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so \"logs/foo.log\"\n# with ServerRoot set to \"C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2\" will be interpreted by the\n# server as \"C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log\".\n#\n# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes\n# instead of backslashes (e.g., \"c:/apache\" instead of \"c:\\apache\").\n# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which Apache.exe is located\n# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply\n# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point\n# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive\n# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple\n# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.\n#\nServerRoot \"c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.21\"\n\n#\n# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or\n# ports, instead of the default.

Here's the comparison:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Server</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Server: Apache\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3\nContent-Disposition: inline filename=\"downloaded.pdf\"\nContent-Length: 21331445\nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n200 OK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Bad Server</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Server: Apache\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17\nContent-Disposition: inline filename=\"downloaded.pdf\"\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nKeep-Alive: timeout=10, max=30\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n200 OK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I found some articles suggesting to turn gzip off by making sure that \"output_buffering = Off\" and \"zlib.output_compression = Off\" in the php.ini file. This is the case though, and my phpinfo() from both servers shows that output_buffering and output_compression are turned off.</p>\n\n<p>We're certainly on the right track. Any suggestions from here on why this is being gzipped? And how to prevent it?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Update: Resolved</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found a forum on the hosting provider's website where someone explained that gzip has recently been turned on, and detailed how to stop it. <a href=\"http://www.bluehostforum.com/showthread.php?18996-Turning-off-Gzip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bluehostforum.com/showthread.php?18996-Turning-off-Gzip</a> </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I added the following to my .htaccess file, which turns off the gzip compression. Then, I get the Content-Length header, and my progress bar.</p>\n\n<pre><code>SetEnv no-gzip dont-vary\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks so much!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","windows","apache",".htaccess","windows-8"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13203608,"title":"Apache 403 (Forbidden) on subdirectory on Windows","body":"<p>So yesterday i installed Apache 2.2, PHP 5.3, and MySQL on my Windows 8 Machine.

Let me break it down:</p>\n\n<p>We have an apache2 server which hosts most of our company's websites. Each website is a separate vhost. One of this vhosts is used by our internal UI Designer to present his latest drafts and projects to both internal users and 3rd party clients. At the moment, this VHost is password protected from the Vhost configuration file using this directive: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;\n   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n   AllowOverride all\n   Order allow,deny\n   Allow from all\n   AuthUserFile /home/secure/passwords\n   AuthName \"Username and password required\"\n   AuthType Basic\n   Require valid-user\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I need is to make this website available (so NO password prompt) to our internal users meaning a specific IP range. I have tried to use the <code>Allow from 192.168.xxx.xxx</code> option in the above instruction set. However this is not letting the internal IP through (still asking for a password). So I tried to use our company's external IP address (which you can find on any \"what's my IP website\"). No luck with that either.</p>\n\n<p>So for my last attempt, I have created a second vhost which obviously uses a different ServerName. Also, in order not to have any conflicts in the configuration file, I have created a symlink to /var/www and called it www2. Therefore, the Directory directive in the second vhost file looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www2/&gt;\n   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n   AllowOverride none\n   Order allow,deny\n   Allow from all\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However the configuration files are clearly conflicting because with the current configuration I get password protection on both hosts. If I disable this in the first Vhost, I lose it on both.</p>\n\n<p>There is no .htaccess file in any of the directories, so there is nothing there to overwrite the configuration. The apache2.conf file has nothing defined related to Auth.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if you require more details, but feel free to ask me anything.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the help!</p>\n\n<p>----edit----\nI just want to specify that I can't say 100% that my method of doing it is the correct one. Maybe setting up 2 VHosts isn't the solution to my problem. If anyone thinks of a better way of doing it, I'm open to suggestions. Bottom line is that I need one website to be available to internal users and password protected for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","hadoop","breadth-first-search","hama"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13146078,"title":"DryadOpt (A library for parallel branch and Bound ) - availablity","body":"<p>I am trying to implement a parallel branch and bound BFS.

Once the result set are returned, PHP loop through the result set, row by row and display the rows as it flow through. </p>\n\n<p>What happens is that from time to time, the result page can take a extremely long to load,where no results set are displayed but the web browser loading bar/icon flashes. Some times it will just give a blank screen at the end of the load, which typically means the query connection has timed-out or some times it will return the result set. For example, under normal behaviour, a page will take approx 1-3s to load, while at odd times, it may take up to 20-30s.</p>\n\n<p>I have noticed that if I run queries in SQLSVR Mgmt Studio, queries that may take ~5s to return a result set may take approx ~15s to load on my web server. </p>\n\n<p>I know poor PHP coding can cause slow downs but the odd performance behaviour has me bit baffled, as Im sure my coding isnt that bad.</p>\n\n<p>So if people could offer some tips in how I can go about diagnosting or isolating the problem, or advise areas that I could look at, it will be great.

Also, all machines will exist on a private network that is not connected to the internet.  While it's important to have SOME security, it's mostly necessary to prevent mistakes.  My objective is to configure some \"thin servers\".  Via a PHP script, I need to be able to change the network config (static or DHCP) and restart networking.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I tried was to write a C program that is SUID root.  It reads, modifies, and writes a network config file.  If I run it as a regular user, it works just fine and can access and modify a file owned by root.  But if I run it from a PHP script, I get access errors.  It appears that Apache prevents SUID root somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Based on suggestions from other discussions, I tried the \"sudo\" method.  Temporarily, I added this to /etc/sudoers: \napache  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL</p>\n\n<p>The error I get is this:\nsudo: unable to open audit system: Permission denied</p>\n\n<p>According to this page in Russian, this is happening because systems like RHEL (I'm using Fedora) default to requiretty for sudoers.

Apache acts as a \"front gate\" for all requests and sends them to JBoss via mod_jk. Everything was working fine until I had to do some SEO optimizations. These optimizations include SEF urls, so i decided to use mod_rewrite for Apache to alter requests before they are sent to JBoss. Basically, I nedd to implement 2 rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Redirect old rules like \"http://hostname/directory/<em>\" to \"http://hostname/</em>\" with permanent redirect</li>\n<li>Forward urls like \"http://hostname/wtf/123/\" to \"http://hostname/wtf/view.htm?id=123\" so that end user doesn't see the \"ugly\" URL (the actual rewrite).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is my Apache config for test virtual host:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\nServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com\nDocumentRoot \"/usr/local/www/dummy\"\nServerName 192.168.1.10\n\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\n\n    RewriteEngine On\n\n    RewriteRule /directory/(.*) /$1 [R=permanent,L]\n    RewriteRule ^/([^/]+)/([0-9]+)/?$   /$1/view.htm?id=$2\n\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\nJkMount     /*      jsp-hostname\n\nErrorLog \"/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-error_log\"\nCustomLog \"/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-access_log\" common\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that second rewrite rule doesn't work.

Looks like it wasn't necessary or applied to an older version of Rails.  The inconsistencies in instructions when looking up help online is disorienting!  Removing the file leaves me with the previous problem though.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the entry in the Apache log that I believe correlates with the first error.

I want to upload the files to S3.\nOne option would be to make a POST-request and wait until the server would receive the file.\nProblems here are, that there would be a delay, when the file is being uploaded from my server to the S3 servers, and it would double the uploading time.</p>\n\n<p>Best would be, if I could validate the request, and then redirecting it, so the client uploads it directly to the s3-storage. Not sure if this is possible somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Uploading directly to S3 doesn't seem to be very smart.\nAfter looking into other apps like Droplr and Dropmark, it looks like they don't do this.\nBtw. I did this using Little Snitch.</p>\n\n<p>They have their api on their own web-server, and that's it.</p>\n\n<p>Could someone clear things up for me?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nHow should I transmit my files to S3?\nIs there a way to \"forward\" it, \nor do I have to upload it to my server and then upload it from there to S3?\nLike I said, other apps can do this efficiently and without the need of communicating with S3 directly. </p>\n"},{"tags":["django","performance","apache","memory","nginx"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":13110028,"title":"Django Performance / Memory usage","body":"<p>I am running an alpha version of my app on a EC2 Small instance (1.7 GB RAM) with postgres and apache (wsgi-mod not as daemon but directly) on it.</p>\n\n<p>Performance is alright, but it could be better.

The site was initially written with no regard to character case. Some filenames were all upper-case, some lower-case, and some mixed. This was never a problem in Windows, of course, but now we're moving to a case-sensitive file system. </p>\n\n<p>A with a quick find/rename command (thanks to another tutorial) got the filenames to all lowercase. </p>\n\n<p>However, many of the URL references in the code still point to these mixed-case filenames, so I enabled mod_speling to overcome this issue. It seems to work OK for the most part, with the exception of one page: I have a file name haematobium.html, which, everytime a link points to .../haematobium.html, it gets rewritten as .../hæmatobium.html in the browser. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know how this strange character made its way into the filename in the first place, but I've corrected the code in the html document to now link to haematobium.html, then renamed the haematobium.html file itself to match. </p>\n\n<p>When requesting .../haematobium.html in Chrome, it \"corrects\" to .../hæmatobium.html in the address bar, and shows an error saying \"The requested URL .../hÃ¦matobium.html was not found on this server.\" </p>\n\n<p>In IE9, I'm promted for the login (this is a .htaccess protected page), I enter it, and then if forwards the URL to .../h%C3%A6matobium.html, which again doesn't load.</p>\n\n<p>In my frustration I even copied haematobium.html to both hæmatobium.html and hÃ¦matobium.html, still, none of the tree pages actually load. </p>\n\n<p>So my question: I read somewhere that mod_speling tries to \"learn\" misspelled URLs.

If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with \"/\", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so \"logs/access_log\"\n# with ServerRoot set to \"/usr/local/apache2\" will be interpreted by the\n# server as \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log\", whereas \"/logs/access_log\" \n# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.\n#\n# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes\n# instead of backslashes (e.g., \"c:/apache\" instead of \"c:\\apache\").\n# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located\n# will be used by default.

So if I'm able to reduce half of Y, have I also reduced half of X? </p>\n\n<p>(Also Im not really sure what Processing, Waiting and Total mean).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I'll reopen this question since I'm facing the problem again.\nRecently I installed Varnish.\nI run ab like this:\nab -n 100  <a href=\"http://my-domain.local/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://my-domain.local/</a>\nApache bench reports very fast response times:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Requests per second:    462.92 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       2.160 [ms] (mean)\nTime per request:       2.160 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\nTransfer rate:          6131.37 [Kbytes/sec] received\n\nConnection Times (ms)\n              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max\nConnect:        0    0   0.0      0       0\nProcessing:     1    2   2.3      1      13\nWaiting:        0    1   2.0      1      12\nTotal:          1    2   2.3      1      13\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the time per request is about 2.2 ms. When I browse the site (as an anonymous user) the page load time is about 1.5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture from Firebug net tab.

Or is there any Apache Log I/O issue I'm supposed to take care when running it?</p>\n\n<p>Thx very much</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","apache","url","mod-rewrite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":190,"score":0,"question_id":6873536,"title":"Strange characters in url - simple link and mod_rewrite","body":"<p>Please see: <a href=\"http://test.shivimpanim.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://test.shivimpanim.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Click on any of Video, Action, Games, or Tools</p>\n\n<p>Notice how strange characters get appended to the end of the url! <strong>Why is that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sniffing in Charles give me no indication of a secondary redirect...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my .htaccess:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code># Set up mod_rewrite\nOptions +FollowSymLinks\nRewriteEngine on\n#\n# Rules follow\n\nRewriteBase /\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^(.*)/$ $1 [R,L]\n\n# Here we simply remap the name if it doesn't exist as a file or directory\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n\nRewriteRule ^video$ /index.php?s=video [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^action$ /index.php?s=action [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^games$ /index.php?s=games [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^tools$ /index.php?s=tools [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^jplay$ /index.php?s=jplay [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^contact$ /index.php?s=contact [NC,L]\n\nRewriteRule ^video/(.*) /index.php?s=video&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^action/(.*) /index.php?s=action&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^games/(.*) /index.php?s=games&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^tools/(.*) /index.php?s=tools&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^jplay/(.*) /index.php?s=jplay&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^contact/(.*) /index.php?s=contact&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my index.php:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$pageurl = $_REQUEST['p'];\n$section = $_REQUEST['s'];\n\ninclude_once('main_top.php');\n\necho($section);\n\ninclude_once('main_bottom.php');\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my main_top.php:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php \n    $top_menu_home = 'top_menu_home';\n    $top_menu_store = 'top_menu_store';\n    $top_menu_video = 'top_menu_video';\n    $top_menu_action = 'top_menu_action';\n    $top_menu_games = 'top_menu_games';\n    $top_menu_tools = 'top_menu_tools';\n    $top_menu_articles = 'top_menu_articles';\n    $top_menu_jplay = 'top_menu_jplay';\n    $top_menu_contact = 'top_menu_contact';\n\n    switch($section) {\n        case 'store': $top_menu_store .= '_selected';

There is an FTP login and a control panel which gives access to the typical hosting, database and mailbox setup. </p>\n\n<p>Offline I am running RHEL 6.2 (Scientific Linux) with freshly installed Apache, mysql and PHP. I have the site content running as a virtual host on a dummy local domain and have copied the contents of the mysql database locally. </p>\n\n<p>Versions - Apache 2.2.15 (Scientific Linux) PHP 5.3.3 Mysql 5.1.61</p>\n\n<p>At a basic level my offline mirror works. Apache is serving up the HTML/CSS and images. The PHP files for the main content are pulling information out of the database and displaying it in the browser visible website. </p>\n\n<h3>The problem...</h3>\n\n<p>...is that the back-end administration section of the website appears to be in suspended animation - at the login panel stage it just sits there, unresponsive, when credentials are entered. </p>\n\n<p>I had been hoping that I could just change the MD5 encrypted password stored in the database and then get the admin section up and running offline. </p>\n\n<p>There is also a very slight visual difference between the online and offline versions of the login page. </p>\n\n<p>Online [<a href=\"http://imgur.com/J0yLh\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/J0yLh</a>]\nOffline [<a href=\"http://imgur.com/sDb6l\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/sDb6l</a>]</p>\n\n<p>This admin section has been coded in PHP using CodeIgniter as the framework. </p>\n\n<h3>Here are my notes so far from attempting to fix this....</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Mod_rewrite seems to be required by CodeIgniter.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed this module is loaded by my local Apache (the module is listed to load in httpd.conf) and I have tested that it is working.</p>\n\n<p>The strange thing is that the method used to test relies on settings in a .htaccess file, while on the live site the .htaccess file is an empty file and I cannot find any other file on the FTP or switch via the admin panel that sets up mod_rewrite. </p>\n\n<p>If mod_rewrite is required for CodeIgniter then it is a mystery how it is setup on the online server. (It is worth me saying that it is /possible/ that there is a httpd.conf config for this on the server itself as the hosting company and original web design firm have very similiar names so may be one and the same.) </p>\n\n<p><strong>$config['url_protocol'] = \"AUTO\";</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried this in each of the settings and none seem to make it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code Igniter error logs...</strong> </p>\n\n<p>These are the result of switching '$config['log_threshold'] = 4' within config.php (../admin/system/application/config).</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function set_magic_quotes_runtime() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/codeigniter/CodeIgniter.php 46\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Config Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Hooks Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Router Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Output Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Input Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Global POST and COOKIE data sanitized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; URI Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Language Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Loader Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: url, form, array, auth\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/database/DB.php 81\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Database Driver Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Session Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Controller Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: url\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: form\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Config file loaded: config/bookings_settings.php\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177 \nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; File loaded: /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/application/views/login_view.php\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Final output sent to browser\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Total execution time: 0.0278\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There were also repeated warnings regarding an incorrect timezone declaration which PHP states it corrects.

The server generates an executable which it should then run using batch. However, it doesn't appear to be running.

There are 2 issues, and I'm trying to solve one at a time. The first issue is that when manually executed (by me simply running ./cmd.sh), I get the following errors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh: 1: /var/www/dbCAN/tools/blast/bin/blastall: not found\nsh: 1: /var/www/dbCAN/tools/blast/bin/blastall: not found\nsh: 1: -t: not found\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this doesn't really make sense to me, as the directory specified does in fact contain blastall. It has full rwx permissions and every directory along the way has appropriate permissions. </p>\n\n<p>The blast.php file in tools looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n  do_blast($opts[\"w\"]);\n  $info['status'] = 'done';\n  $fp = fopen(\"$opts['w']/info.yaml\",\"w\")\n  fwrite($fp, Sypc::YAMLDump($info)); fclose($fp);  \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With of course variable declarations above it, and the do_blast function looks like this (again with variables declared above it and a cd so the directories work out):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function do_blast($workdir)\n{\n  system(\"/var/www/dbCAN/tools/blast/bin/blastall -d data/blast/all.seq.fa -m 9 -p blastp -i $workdir/input.faa -o $workdir/output.txt\")\n  system(\"/var/www/dbCAN/tools/blast/bin/blastall -d data/blast/all.seq.fa -p blastp -i $workdir/input.faa -o $workdir/output2.txt\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea what may be causing this issue? I thought it may be because I'm running it and it was created by apache, but rwx is allowed for all users. I can include more information if needed, but I chose not to at this point because the original person who wrote the PHP split up everything into tons of little files, so it's difficult to pinpoint where the problem is exactly. Any ideas (if not complete solutions) are very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Solution found. As it turns out, the blastall executable had been compiled on a different linux system. Switched to a different executable and it ran flawlessly. </p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","amazon-ec2","amazon-web-services","amazon","web-hosting"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":920,"score":1,"question_id":6721304,"title":"Amazon EC2 How Do I host My Own Content?

In other words when I type the ip address of computer B from computer A the browsers says: server at 192.168.0.120 is taking to long to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Things that I have done in order to solve the problem on computer B: (remember I want to connect to computer B from computer A)</p>\n\n<p>1) turn off the firewall</p>\n\n<p>2) Uninstall wamp and reinstall it.</p>\n\n<p>3) turn off the anti-virus.</p>\n\n<p>4) turn off windows firewall</p>\n\n<p>5) Place wamp online and after putting it online restart all services</p>\n\n<h2>after doing all those steps I still cannot connect to it from computer B!</h2>\n\n<p>I have not chaged any ini file plus I have uninstall it and install it again so why is it not possible to connect to it!? I have used wamp for the last 3 years and I have never experienced this.</p>\n\n<p>Also wamp is the only web server that I have installed on this computer. I don't have IIS nor any other web server installed on my computer. </p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","ant","selenium"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":3,"question_id":12462123,"title":"Ant build not able to recognize spanish characters","body":"<p>I am having a Selenium project that uses Apache ANT to execute the tests.</p>\n\n<p>In a certain scenario i need to validate a few Spanish texts like \"eBay España\" i.e. text with accented characters.</p>\n\n<p>When i execute the test normally from my IntelliJ IDEA IDE it runs properly and validates the  Spanish characters appropriately.</p>\n\n<p>But when i try executing the test from Apache ANT console in the IDE , it is not able to recognize the Spanish accented characters.</p>\n\n<p>Check O/P</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Normal Execution -</strong></p>\n\n<p>INFO [main] (VerifySpanishCharacters.java:45) -

Not all files in the audio archive are allowed to be dowloaded so the /sermon/{filename}.mp3 path is rewritten to really execute /sermon.php?filename={filename} and if the file is allowed to be downloaded then the content type is set to \"audio/mpeg\" and the file streamed out using readfile().

The reason why the files are kind of big is because they are graphic design files. Ideally, they would have their customers transfer their files via FTP using an FTP client like Filezilla. However my client has stated that they spend way too much time trying to school people on how to enter FTP credentials into an FTP program and the concept of FTP in general.</p>\n\n<p>So ultimately my client has stated that they would like the customer to be able to use a web interface, which they're already familiar with, to be able to accomplish the same task.

After speaking to a RS Cloud tech support person I've narrowed it down to the temporary directory /tmp/ in the Apache server. That is the server is not able to write large files into that temporary directory because of their server wide restrictions. That is, they cannot change this to accomodate my needs. They said I would need a dedicated server for that, which, is not an option for me.</p>\n\n<p>After doing some thinking though, I've come to the conclusion that it's silly for me to have to upload a file to the server's temporary directory, only to move the file to the ftp server. So this brings me to my question: <strong>is it possible for a web based PHP script to send the file directly from the user's machine, bypass the web server, and send it directly to the FTP server</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>If not, do you have any other suggestions?

So I can do rewriting URLs as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^galleries/[A-Z0-9_-]+/css/(.*)$ ./css/$1 [nc]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that since <a href=\"http://www.domain.com/somedir/galleries/cats\">http://www.domain.com/somedir/galleries/cats</a> is a virtual directory, the above only works if the user types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://www.domain.com/somedir/gallaries/cats/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the user omits the trailing slash mod_dir will not add it because in actual fact this directory does not actually exist.</p>\n\n<p>If I put a redirect rewrite with the absolute URL it works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^galleries/([A-Z0-9_-]+)$ http://www.mydomain.com/subdir/galleries/$1/ [R,nc,L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I don't want to have the URL prefix hardcoded because I want to be able to put this on whatever domain I want in whatever subdir I want, so I tried this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^galleries/([A-Z0-9_-]+)$ galleries/$1/ [R,nc,L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But instead it redirects to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://www.mydomain.com/home/myaccount/public_html/subdir/galleries/theRest\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which obviously is not what I want.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Further clarifications</p>\n\n<p>The solution I am looking for is to avoid hardcoding the domain name or folder paths in .htaccess. I am looking for a solution where if I package the .htaccess with the rest of the scripts and resources, wherever the user unzips it on his web server it works out of the box. All works like that apart from this trailing slash issue.</p>\n\n<p>So any solution which involves hardcoding the parent directory or the webserver's path in .htaccess in any way is not what I am looking for. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","apache",".htaccess","mod-rewrite","redirect"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":12850847,"title":"Redirect example.com/out/1234 to another URL","body":"<p>I know theres a lot of posts about redirects but this is a little different (I think).</p>\n\n<p>Basically I want my outlinks to be example.com/out/1234 and I want them to go to a php that looks up the URL 1234 if referenced to in MySQL and the php header redirect to that URL.</p>\n\n<p>The problem Im having is passing 1234 to a page.

I have seen <code>mod_mellon</code>, <code>mod_auth_saml</code>, and <code>mod_shib</code>, which all support SAML in Apache, and I know that at least <code>mod_mellon</code> will pass through the results of the SAML authentication in the headers of the HTTP request. So that does basically solve my problem, but for a couple of things I will get to in a minute.</p>\n\n<p>What I would ultimately like is something similar to this, except that Apache would perform the authentication and send through the results of that authentication through to the web apps.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the flow would be something like:</p>\n\n<p><code>Request -&gt; Not Authenticated -&gt; Redirect to Login Page -&gt; Authenticate (e.g. via LDAP) -&gt; Add results to headers -&gt; Redirect to requested page</code>, all without leaving Apache.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the same flow as a typical SSO provider, except that Apache is essentially acting as both the IdP and a Reverse Proxy, and it informs the SP that Authentication was successful by including the results in the headers. It might be <em>simpler</em> to go with a separate IdP, but I'd like to avoid the overhead if I possibly can.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regardless of whether I go with Apache <em>plus</em> IdP, or Apache <em>as</em> IdP, I'd need to be able to secure what's being added to the headers, e.g. by signing them.</p>\n\n<p>Hang on a second, though - if I want to sign these things, maybe I should just include a SAML token, since the SAML standard (and libraries) takes care of that...</p>\n\n<p>Last question, then: <strike>Is it possible to have Apache act as an SP, make the call to an IdP, then forward the SAML token on to the App that's behind the reverse proxy?</strike> Upon further reading, it appears that the <code>ECP</code>, or \"Enhanced Client or Proxy Profile\" might allow for this. It's not intended for this use case (it's actually intended for, e.g. a WAP proxy), but it might allow me to do what I want. <strike>Does the SAML standard allow for something other than the SP to initiate the login request?</strike> It does, and is called <code>IdP-Initiated SSO</code>. <strike>I believe the first part of this question is still relevant, however.</strike></p>\n\n<p>I'd really appreciate any suggestions or comments anyone has (even \"WTF are you trying to do?!\" comments are appreciated).</p>\n\n<p><code>*</code> I should note that while in this situation, we have control over all the pieces of the puzzle, there are likely to be situations where we are required to, for security-related reasons, allow a clients' users to login to our application via their SSO infrastructure, but where we do not have network access to their IdP. Their IdP would, however, have network access to our reverse proxy. I believe that this was actual requirement for a recent potential client.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","linux","apache","xampp","smarty"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":518,"score":1,"question_id":8883682,"title":"PHP Permission Denied Errors","body":"<p>I'm trying to troubleshoot this error, but I have had no luck. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Warning: mkdir() [function.mkdir]: Permission denied in Users/myuser/Sites/mysite.me/git/framework/libs/smarty/sysplugins/smarty_internal_write_file.php\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I keep getting a mkdir() function.mkdir permission denied error in one particular folder.

Is CloudFront just the edge-CDN service?</p>\n\n<p>2) We currently upload images via a PHP script which FTPs them to our image server, or via manual FTP upload. How will that change if I use S3? I heard you can't FTP to it? :(</p>\n\n<p>3) If using S3, can I still create hierarchical directories and store images inside these? The images are stored various folders deep and I can't afford to change the code, but I heard S3 was a flat \"bucket\"?</p>\n\n<p>4) Finally, I heard that with CloudFront, if a file changes, you have to issue an invalidation request, which costs money. Is this because CloudFront is caching the image from the origin? I'm not used to this as in my current setup I just replace an image via FTP and it updates!

So far, so good.  I haven't experienced max load yet, but the server seems more consistent and we're not seeing random requests take 2min waiting for a mod_wsgi response. Memory footprint has gone from 3.5G to 1G. This is awesome. We're running on a single VPS with 6G of ram. There's one Django app running on this sevrer along with an instance of memcache, to which we've allocated 1G of ram. We have a separate MySql server.</p>\n\n<p>Our application is bulky and can certainly be optimized. We're using NewRelic to troubleshoot some of the more slow running pages now. I've read a lot on optimizing mod_wsgi/apache but, like everyone else, I'm still left with a few questions. </p>\n\n<p>Our average application page load time is 650-750ms. A lot of our pages are in the 200ms range, but we've got some dogs that take 2-5+ seconds to load.

The other 10% are served through Apache on our https pages or someone pointing lazily to our local server. At nominal load, 15 worker processes end up being created, so I'm thinking I should probably just set StartServers=15?

I love how some people in here made this possible, but yet I stumbled upon another big kind of problem.

I beieve the problem resides in the hardcoding to <code>System.in</code>, the <code>Scanner</code> class, the <code>Console</code> class etc. So here's what I need some help with (finally):\nI want to either be able to directly access the <code>InputStream</code> passed to my application or someone explaining a way to me of how to actually write an <code>InputStreamListener</code> that will occasionaly be used when I run external java applications (yes, I run them through my interface instead of cmd or terminal, I am trying to make a tool here).

Each user runs 50 continuesly. <strong>If X users are running concurrently, tx would be X times slower than running just 1 user.</strong> That looks like single threaded. Is it what Apache should be or is it something wrong with my configuration?</p>\n\n<p>BTW, for mpm, I tried both prefork and worker. For cgi module, I tried mod_cgi and mod_cgid. Same thing happened.</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","mod-rewrite"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":12711593,"title":"Basic mod_rewrite operation with question mark","body":"<p>I would like to rewrite an address from:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mysite.com/page?att=XXXXX\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mysite.com/page?att=XXXXX</a>\nto:\n<a href=\"http://mysite.com/page.php?att=XXXXX\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mysite.com/page.php?att=XXXXX</a></p>\n\n<p>I have tried the following code, but does not work for me.

Now, however, I need to actually integrate the Django application into the main site. In my Apache 2.0 configuration file (for say <a href=\"http://www.example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.example.com</a>) I added the following ProxyPass commands (after my mod_wsgi initialization):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ProxyPass        /app/newsletter     http://www.example.com:8000/app/newsletter\nProxyPassReverse /app/newsletter     http://www.example.com:8000/app/newsletter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here I expect that any request to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://www.example.com/app/newsletter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will get successfully proxied to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://www.example.com:8000/app/newsletter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and all will be right with the world.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not the case. Apache hangs for 5 or so minutes (the time taken to craft this question) then spits out a <strong>502 Proxy Error</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Proxy Error\n\nThe proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.\nThe proxy server could not handle the request GET /app/newsletter/.\n\nReason: Error reading from remote server\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Watching my Apache 2.0 error log after this response I see continuous errors like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Thu Sep 27 15:25:49 2012] [error] Exception KeyError: KeyError(****,) in &lt;module 'threading' from '/usr/lib64/python2.6/threading.pyc'&gt; ignored\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So something seems to be remiss in either how mod_proxy plays with Django and/or Python. I have other Java related processes that I use ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse on and they work fine. Also, when I don't try to apply the ProxyPass the Django apps all work well (ie. when I address them on port 8000 directly).</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

Anyway, because of already active httpd.exe my portable server's WordPress site can only be accessed through localhost:81 - this is a problem as WP site is very dependent on the URL and I don't want to include the url with port on WP database.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I want to do through .htaccess:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On any path except for error.php file check if not port 80</li>\n<li>If not port 80 redirect to /error.php?code=port</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It it possible for it to have priority over WP redirection or URL handling?</p>\n\n<p>In the error.php I provided info on how to manually close httpd.exe and such so my family and friends can access the portable site. It's sort of like a gallery and calender  application for events and other such stuff...</p>\n\n<p>Please help? I'm I can't figure it out at all.

The only thing throwing me off that I'm running from /testsite and not /cprm.  I could just cd .. before.  Anyway, so since in the internal server it is writing to the console, i guess i need to do the equivalent in apache.  I'm not sure where the apache console is.  I tried adding permission to the apache log file as that is where the error gets generated.

Thanks for the response.  I have done some reading on the topic now.  So I made the changes you indicated.

So that is good.  However, the test.bat file w/ the echo hello does not execute and i still get the same message.  And thanks for the permission advice.  I am now no longer using virtual.

I'm not sure how best to work around this. Since the user is being redirected by a Django view, at first I was thinking I could copy over the cookies, swapping out the old domain for the new one. Another thought is to copy the cookies to a database table, indexed with a one-use lookup hash (e.g. the same way Django does registration confirmations), and include this hash in the redirect, which the app would then use to lookup the cookies and set them in the client. Would either of these work?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Are there any better solutions to these 3 problems? Are there any other issues or problems I've overlooked?</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","mod-rewrite","redirect"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":12520902,"title":"Issue performing external redirect with htaccess after server performs internal redirect","body":"<p>I am having issues getting mod_rewrite working on a website I am helping put together. It is for an organization I am involved with in school.</p>\n\n<p>Currently our organization has a domain name through GoDaddy, which redirects to servers hosted by our school. Unfortunately, this sometimes leaves double backslashes in the url. These double backslashes cause issues with us setting cookies, because the url with the single backslash is recognized as a different domain than the url with the double backslashes. </p>\n\n<p>I know that removing double backslashes is usually a simple matter with a htaccess file; however, the school already has a htaccess file somewhere above our directory that performs an internal redirect, removing the double backslashes from the request uri. This means that the htaccess in our docroot cannot tell whether or not the url has double backslashes in it. Meanwhile, since the redirect is internal, the browser does not know to perform a 301 redirect to a url without the double backslashes. </p>\n\n<p>What would be the best way to work around this issue?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","svn","ubuntu"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12516544,"title":"Apache2 host two sites on the same server","body":"<p>I am trying to host subversion and wiki on the same site. </p>\n\n<p>I have created two files in /etc/apache2/sites-available </p>\n\n<p>in \"subversion\"</p>\n\n<p>I have</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost -myserverIP-:80&gt;\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        ServerName  svn.example.com\n        DocumentRoot /var/svn/repos\n        &lt;Location /svn/repos&gt;\n                DAV svn\n                SVNPath /var/svn/repos\n      AuthType Basic\n      AuthName \"Subversion Repository\"\n      AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords\n      Require valid-user\n        &lt;/Location&gt;\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and in \"wiki\" I have</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost -myserverIP-:80&gt;\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        ServerName wiki\n        ServerAlias -myserverIP-\n\n        DocumentRoot /home/www/wiki/html\n        &lt;Directory /home/www/wiki/html&gt;\n                AllowOverride None\n                Options -Indexes -MultiViews -SymLinksIfOwnerMatch +FollowSymLinks\n                Order allow,deny\n                allow from all\n        &lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n        &lt;Location /wiki&gt;\n        &lt;/Location&gt;\n\n        &lt;DirectoryMatch \"^/home/www/wiki/html/(data|conf|bin|inc)/\"&gt;\n            Order allow,deny\n            Deny from all\n            Satisfy All\n        &lt;/DirectoryMatch&gt;\n\n        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n        # alert, emerg.\n        LogLevel warn\n\n        ErrorLog /home/www/wiki/logs/error.log\n        CustomLog /home/www/wiki/logs/access.log combined\n\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However now, when I browse to the IP address of the server, I get the contents of the /var/svn/repos directory, wheras when I just had the wiki page, I got the wiki index page.
