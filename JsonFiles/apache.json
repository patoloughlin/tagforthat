It seems to suggest there is some bug in Tomcat 6 which was fixed in version 6.0.20, a slightly higher version than the one we're using. Unfortunately it doesn't mention what the issue itself was. I've <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/changelog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">had a look</a> at the Tomcat changelog, but can't see any likely candidates for a bug which could cause this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, on to my actual question, has anyone encountered a similar problem, and if so, what was the underlying issue and how did you resolve it?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any responses. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This appears to be some kind of problem with load balancing and Tomcat. If you bypass the load balancer and access Tomcat directly via the server IP address, the problem goes away. The strange thing is that this appears in both our staging environment, in which we use Apache/AJP1.3, and live, where we use Zeus. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: This turned out to be an issue with the clients firewall. It appears that they were.. er.. not being entirely truthful when they said that the knew definitely this was not a Firewall issue.</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","web2py"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13218303,"title":"web2py rocket or Apache","body":"<p>Web2py states in the home page 'including fast multi-threaded web server' and I have seen text that says the rocket server performs as well as Apache.

They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure\n# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  \n#\n# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many\n# of the server's control files begin with \"/\" (or \"drive:/\" for Win32), the\n# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with \"/\", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so \"logs/foo.log\"\n# with ServerRoot set to \"C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2\" will be interpreted by the\n# server as \"C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log\".\n#\n# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes\n# instead of backslashes (e.g., \"c:/apache\" instead of \"c:\\apache\").\n# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which Apache.exe is located\n# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply\n# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point\n# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive\n# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple\n# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.\n#\nServerRoot \"c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.21\"\n\n#\n# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or\n# ports, instead of the default.

Here's the comparison:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Server</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Server: Apache\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3\nContent-Disposition: inline filename=\"downloaded.pdf\"\nContent-Length: 21331445\nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n200 OK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Bad Server</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Server: Apache\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17\nContent-Disposition: inline filename=\"downloaded.pdf\"\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nKeep-Alive: timeout=10, max=30\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n200 OK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I found some articles suggesting to turn gzip off by making sure that \"output_buffering = Off\" and \"zlib.output_compression = Off\" in the php.ini file. This is the case though, and my phpinfo() from both servers shows that output_buffering and output_compression are turned off.</p>\n\n<p>We're certainly on the right track. Any suggestions from here on why this is being gzipped? And how to prevent it?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Update: Resolved</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found a forum on the hosting provider's website where someone explained that gzip has recently been turned on, and detailed how to stop it. <a href=\"http://www.bluehostforum.com/showthread.php?18996-Turning-off-Gzip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bluehostforum.com/showthread.php?18996-Turning-off-Gzip</a> </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I added the following to my .htaccess file, which turns off the gzip compression. Then, I get the Content-Length header, and my progress bar.</p>\n\n<pre><code>SetEnv no-gzip dont-vary\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks so much!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","windows","apache",".htaccess","windows-8"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13203608,"title":"Apache 403 (Forbidden) on subdirectory on Windows","body":"<p>So yesterday i installed Apache 2.2, PHP 5.3, and MySQL on my Windows 8 Machine.

Let me break it down:</p>\n\n<p>We have an apache2 server which hosts most of our company's websites. Each website is a separate vhost. One of this vhosts is used by our internal UI Designer to present his latest drafts and projects to both internal users and 3rd party clients. At the moment, this VHost is password protected from the Vhost configuration file using this directive: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;\n   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n   AllowOverride all\n   Order allow,deny\n   Allow from all\n   AuthUserFile /home/secure/passwords\n   AuthName \"Username and password required\"\n   AuthType Basic\n   Require valid-user\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I need is to make this website available (so NO password prompt) to our internal users meaning a specific IP range. I have tried to use the <code>Allow from 192.168.xxx.xxx</code> option in the above instruction set. However this is not letting the internal IP through (still asking for a password). So I tried to use our company's external IP address (which you can find on any \"what's my IP website\"). No luck with that either.</p>\n\n<p>So for my last attempt, I have created a second vhost which obviously uses a different ServerName. Also, in order not to have any conflicts in the configuration file, I have created a symlink to /var/www and called it www2. Therefore, the Directory directive in the second vhost file looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www2/&gt;\n   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n   AllowOverride none\n   Order allow,deny\n   Allow from all\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However the configuration files are clearly conflicting because with the current configuration I get password protection on both hosts. If I disable this in the first Vhost, I lose it on both.</p>\n\n<p>There is no .htaccess file in any of the directories, so there is nothing there to overwrite the configuration. The apache2.conf file has nothing defined related to Auth.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if you require more details, but feel free to ask me anything.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the help!</p>\n\n<p>----edit----\nI just want to specify that I can't say 100% that my method of doing it is the correct one. Maybe setting up 2 VHosts isn't the solution to my problem. If anyone thinks of a better way of doing it, I'm open to suggestions. Bottom line is that I need one website to be available to internal users and password protected for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n"},{"tags":["apache","hadoop","breadth-first-search","hama"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13146078,"title":"DryadOpt (A library for parallel branch and Bound ) - availablity","body":"<p>I am trying to implement a parallel branch and bound BFS.

Some times it will just give a blank screen at the end of the load, which typically means the query connection has timed-out or some times it will return the result set. For example, under normal behaviour, a page will take approx 1-3s to load, while at odd times, it may take up to 20-30s.</p>\n\n<p>I have noticed that if I run queries in SQLSVR Mgmt Studio, queries that may take ~5s to return a result set may take approx ~15s to load on my web server. </p>\n\n<p>I know poor PHP coding can cause slow downs but the odd performance behaviour has me bit baffled, as Im sure my coding isnt that bad.</p>\n\n<p>So if people could offer some tips in how I can go about diagnosting or isolating the problem, or advise areas that I could look at, it will be great.

Also, all machines will exist on a private network that is not connected to the internet.  While it's important to have SOME security, it's mostly necessary to prevent mistakes.  My objective is to configure some \"thin servers\".  Via a PHP script, I need to be able to change the network config (static or DHCP) and restart networking.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I tried was to write a C program that is SUID root.  It reads, modifies, and writes a network config file.  If I run it as a regular user, it works just fine and can access and modify a file owned by root.  But if I run it from a PHP script, I get access errors.  It appears that Apache prevents SUID root somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Based on suggestions from other discussions, I tried the \"sudo\" method.

Apache acts as a \"front gate\" for all requests and sends them to JBoss via mod_jk. Everything was working fine until I had to do some SEO optimizations. These optimizations include SEF urls, so i decided to use mod_rewrite for Apache to alter requests before they are sent to JBoss. Basically, I nedd to implement 2 rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Redirect old rules like \"http://hostname/directory/<em>\" to \"http://hostname/</em>\" with permanent redirect</li>\n<li>Forward urls like \"http://hostname/wtf/123/\" to \"http://hostname/wtf/view.htm?id=123\" so that end user doesn't see the \"ugly\" URL (the actual rewrite).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is my Apache config for test virtual host:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\nServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com\nDocumentRoot \"/usr/local/www/dummy\"\nServerName 192.168.1.10\n\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\n\n    RewriteEngine On\n\n    RewriteRule /directory/(.*) /$1 [R=permanent,L]\n    RewriteRule ^/([^/]+)/([0-9]+)/?$   /$1/view.htm?id=$2\n\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\nJkMount     /*      jsp-hostname\n\nErrorLog \"/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-error_log\"\nCustomLog \"/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-access_log\" common\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that second rewrite rule doesn't work.

I tried various things like running the Rails app off a different virtual host called \"blog\" at http:///blog and the routing worked (static pages and all) but no Rails as above.</p>\n\n<p>Update: after playing around some more, I now get a new error message (404):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Not Found</p>\n  \n  <p>The requested URL /dispatch.cgi was\n  not found on this server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have since determined that this cgi 404 was caused by a rewrite rule I had added to .htaccess from guidance from the help.ubuntu.com page I pointed out above.  Looks like it wasn't necessary or applied to an older version of Rails.  The inconsistencies in instructions when looking up help online is disorienting!  Removing the file leaves me with the previous problem though.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the entry in the Apache log that I believe correlates with the first error.

It is used as http:///blog which is not really what I wanted to get, but it's kind of irrelevant as I am using this just to learn Rails in a virtual.

It seems to work OK for the most part, with the exception of one page: I have a file name haematobium.html, which, everytime a link points to .../haematobium.html, it gets rewritten as .../hæmatobium.html in the browser. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know how this strange character made its way into the filename in the first place, but I've corrected the code in the html document to now link to haematobium.html, then renamed the haematobium.html file itself to match. </p>\n\n<p>When requesting .../haematobium.html in Chrome, it \"corrects\" to .../hæmatobium.html in the address bar, and shows an error saying \"The requested URL .../hÃ¦matobium.html was not found on this server.\" </p>\n\n<p>In IE9, I'm promted for the login (this is a .htaccess protected page), I enter it, and then if forwards the URL to .../h%C3%A6matobium.html, which again doesn't load.</p>\n\n<p>In my frustration I even copied haematobium.html to both hæmatobium.html and hÃ¦matobium.html, still, none of the tree pages actually load. </p>\n\n<p>So my question: I read somewhere that mod_speling tries to \"learn\" misspelled URLs.

If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with \"/\", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so \"logs/access_log\"\n# with ServerRoot set to \"/usr/local/apache2\" will be interpreted by the\n# server as \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log\", whereas \"/logs/access_log\" \n# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.\n#\n# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes\n# instead of backslashes (e.g., \"c:/apache\" instead of \"c:\\apache\").\n# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located\n# will be used by default.

So if I'm able to reduce half of Y, have I also reduced half of X? </p>\n\n<p>(Also Im not really sure what Processing, Waiting and Total mean).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I'll reopen this question since I'm facing the problem again.\nRecently I installed Varnish.\nI run ab like this:\nab -n 100  <a href=\"http://my-domain.local/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://my-domain.local/</a>\nApache bench reports very fast response times:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Requests per second:    462.92 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       2.160 [ms] (mean)\nTime per request:       2.160 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\nTransfer rate:          6131.37 [Kbytes/sec] received\n\nConnection Times (ms)\n              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max\nConnect:        0    0   0.0      0       0\nProcessing:     1    2   2.3      1      13\nWaiting:        0    1   2.0      1      12\nTotal:          1    2   2.3      1      13\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the time per request is about 2.2 ms. When I browse the site (as an anonymous user) the page load time is about 1.5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture from Firebug net tab.

Or is there any Apache Log I/O issue I'm supposed to take care when running it?</p>\n\n<p>Thx very much</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","regex","apache","url","mod-rewrite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":190,"score":0,"question_id":6873536,"title":"Strange characters in url - simple link and mod_rewrite","body":"<p>Please see: <a href=\"http://test.shivimpanim.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://test.shivimpanim.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Click on any of Video, Action, Games, or Tools</p>\n\n<p>Notice how strange characters get appended to the end of the url! <strong>Why is that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sniffing in Charles give me no indication of a secondary redirect...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my .htaccess:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code># Set up mod_rewrite\nOptions +FollowSymLinks\nRewriteEngine on\n#\n# Rules follow\n\nRewriteBase /\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^(.*)/$ $1 [R,L]\n\n# Here we simply remap the name if it doesn't exist as a file or directory\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n\nRewriteRule ^video$ /index.php?s=video [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^action$ /index.php?s=action [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^games$ /index.php?s=games [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^tools$ /index.php?s=tools [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^jplay$ /index.php?s=jplay [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^contact$ /index.php?s=contact [NC,L]\n\nRewriteRule ^video/(.*) /index.php?s=video&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^action/(.*) /index.php?s=action&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^games/(.*) /index.php?s=games&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^tools/(.*) /index.php?s=tools&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^jplay/(.*) /index.php?s=jplay&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^contact/(.*) /index.php?s=contact&amp;p=$1 [NC,L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my index.php:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$pageurl = $_REQUEST['p'];\n$section = $_REQUEST['s'];\n\ninclude_once('main_top.php');\n\necho($section);\n\ninclude_once('main_bottom.php');\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Here is my main_top.php:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php \n    $top_menu_home = 'top_menu_home';\n    $top_menu_store = 'top_menu_store';\n    $top_menu_video = 'top_menu_video';\n    $top_menu_action = 'top_menu_action';\n    $top_menu_games = 'top_menu_games';\n    $top_menu_tools = 'top_menu_tools';\n    $top_menu_articles = 'top_menu_articles';\n    $top_menu_jplay = 'top_menu_jplay';\n    $top_menu_contact = 'top_menu_contact';\n\n    switch($section) {\n        case 'store': $top_menu_store .= '_selected';

There is an FTP login and a control panel which gives access to the typical hosting, database and mailbox setup. </p>\n\n<p>Offline I am running RHEL 6.2 (Scientific Linux) with freshly installed Apache, mysql and PHP. I have the site content running as a virtual host on a dummy local domain and have copied the contents of the mysql database locally. </p>\n\n<p>Versions - Apache 2.2.15 (Scientific Linux) PHP 5.3.3 Mysql 5.1.61</p>\n\n<p>At a basic level my offline mirror works. Apache is serving up the HTML/CSS and images. The PHP files for the main content are pulling information out of the database and displaying it in the browser visible website. </p>\n\n<h3>The problem...</h3>\n\n<p>...is that the back-end administration section of the website appears to be in suspended animation - at the login panel stage it just sits there, unresponsive, when credentials are entered. </p>\n\n<p>I had been hoping that I could just change the MD5 encrypted password stored in the database and then get the admin section up and running offline. </p>\n\n<p>There is also a very slight visual difference between the online and offline versions of the login page. </p>\n\n<p>Online [<a href=\"http://imgur.com/J0yLh\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/J0yLh</a>]\nOffline [<a href=\"http://imgur.com/sDb6l\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/sDb6l</a>]</p>\n\n<p>This admin section has been coded in PHP using CodeIgniter as the framework. </p>\n\n<h3>Here are my notes so far from attempting to fix this....</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Mod_rewrite seems to be required by CodeIgniter.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed this module is loaded by my local Apache (the module is listed to load in httpd.conf) and I have tested that it is working.</p>\n\n<p>The strange thing is that the method used to test relies on settings in a .htaccess file, while on the live site the .htaccess file is an empty file and I cannot find any other file on the FTP or switch via the admin panel that sets up mod_rewrite. </p>\n\n<p>If mod_rewrite is required for CodeIgniter then it is a mystery how it is setup on the online server. (It is worth me saying that it is /possible/ that there is a httpd.conf config for this on the server itself as the hosting company and original web design firm have very similiar names so may be one and the same.) </p>\n\n<p><strong>$config['url_protocol'] = \"AUTO\";</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried this in each of the settings and none seem to make it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code Igniter error logs...</strong> </p>\n\n<p>These are the result of switching '$config['log_threshold'] = 4' within config.php (../admin/system/application/config).</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function set_magic_quotes_runtime() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/codeigniter/CodeIgniter.php 46\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Config Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Hooks Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Router Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Output Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Input Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Global POST and COOKIE data sanitized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; URI Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Language Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Loader Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: url, form, array, auth\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/database/DB.php 81\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Database Driver Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Session Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Controller Class Initialized\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: url\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Helpers loaded: form\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Config file loaded: config/bookings_settings.php\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177\nERROR - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Severity: 8192  --&gt; Function ereg() is deprecated /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/libraries/Config.php 177 \nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; File loaded: /var/www/html/website/httpdocs/admin/system/application/views/login_view.php\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Final output sent to browser\nDEBUG - 2012-08-27 15:41:41 --&gt; Total execution time: 0.0278\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There were also repeated warnings regarding an incorrect timezone declaration which PHP states it corrects.

I thought it may be because I'm running it and it was created by apache, but rwx is allowed for all users. I can include more information if needed, but I chose not to at this point because the original person who wrote the PHP split up everything into tons of little files, so it's difficult to pinpoint where the problem is exactly. Any ideas (if not complete solutions) are very appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Solution found. As it turns out, the blastall executable had been compiled on a different linux system.

There are no server side scripts or database calls going on. Just HTML, CSS, JS, and images.  I have already done some things like push js to the end of the body tag to get parallel downloads.  I am aware that the main.html and templates.html are adding to the overall wait time by being done synchronously after js.js downloads, that's not the problem.  I am just surprised at how much \"wait\" time there is for each request.  Does server distance affect this?  what about being on a shared server, does that affect the wait time?

To use pseudo-javascript as an example, something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var local = 'mysite.local';\nvar development = 'dev.mysite.com';\nvar production = 'www.mysite.com';\n\n// Global .htaccess rules\n\nif(environment == local){\n   // Local environment .htaccess rules\n}\n\nif(environment == development){\n   // Development environment .htaccess rules\n}\n\nif(environment == production){\n   //Production envirotnment .htaccess rules\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way all of the environment-specific rules are all grouped together, making a really clean file, and only one variable needs to be changed if an environment is changed.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen a few references to altering settings in Apache's config files, but obviously that's not a viable option if I'm dealing with 3rd-party hosts.</p>\n\n<p>So is this pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking, or can it be done?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","apache","session","google-chrome","php-5.4"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":13015754,"title":"PHP $_SESSION not working in Google Chrome","body":"<p>I recently created a site that allows students to login into a portal that allows them to upload files related to different topics.</p>\n\n<p>Recently a student informed me that my site does not work with Google Chrome, the error that he gets is \"This site has a Re-Direct Loop\".</p>\n\n<p>can someone here please take a look and see what I'm doing wrong in Google Chrome perspective?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

It provides code examples for POST and GET, which return an apr_hash_t of the key+value pairs in the form. parse_form_from_POST marshalls the bucket brigade and flattens it into a buffer, while parse_form_from_GET can simply reference the URL. Both routines rely on a parse_form_from_string routine to walk through each delimited field and extract the information into the hash table.</p>\n\n<p>That would be fine, but it seems like there should be an easier way to do this than adding a couple hundred lines of code to my module. Is there an existing module or routines within apache, apr, or apr-util to extract the field names and associated data from a GET or POST FORM into a structure which C code can more easily access?

The reason why the files are kind of big is because they are graphic design files. Ideally, they would have their customers transfer their files via FTP using an FTP client like Filezilla. However my client has stated that they spend way too much time trying to school people on how to enter FTP credentials into an FTP program and the concept of FTP in general.</p>\n\n<p>So ultimately my client has stated that they would like the customer to be able to use a web interface, which they're already familiar with, to be able to accomplish the same task.

After speaking to a RS Cloud tech support person I've narrowed it down to the temporary directory /tmp/ in the Apache server. That is the server is not able to write large files into that temporary directory because of their server wide restrictions. That is, they cannot change this to accomodate my needs. They said I would need a dedicated server for that, which, is not an option for me.</p>\n\n<p>After doing some thinking though, I've come to the conclusion that it's silly for me to have to upload a file to the server's temporary directory, only to move the file to the ftp server. So this brings me to my question: <strong>is it possible for a web based PHP script to send the file directly from the user's machine, bypass the web server, and send it directly to the FTP server</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>If not, do you have any other suggestions?
