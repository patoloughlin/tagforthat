Actually, I've just started learning about XML schemas (I'm totally a beginner). I've purchased the book \"Definitive XML Schema\" written by Priscilla Walmsley (2nd Edition) which presents XML Schema 1.1 (which I believe is the most recent version).</p>\n\n<p>Now the problem is that in all examples and exercices of the book, the namespaces and location of the schema files are given using a web URL.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of the book:</p>\n\n<p>This is the schema</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;xs:schema  xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n            targetNamespace=\"http://datypic.com/prod\"\n            xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;xs:element name=\"product\" type=\"prod:ProductType\"/&gt;\n    &lt;xs:complexType name=\"ProductType\"&gt;\n        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n            &lt;xs:element name=\"number\" type=\"xs:integer\"/&gt;\n            &lt;xs:element name=\"size\" type=\"prod:SizeType\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n        &lt;xs:attribute name=\"effDate\" type=\"xs:date\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n    &lt;xs:simpleType name=\"SizeType\"&gt;\n        &lt;xs:restriction base=\"xs:integer\"&gt;\n            &lt;xs:minInclusive value=\"2\"/&gt;\n            &lt;xs:maxInclusive value=\"18\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the XML content to be validated against the above mentioned is this</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;prod:product xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\" \n          xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n          xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://datypic.com/prod prod.xsd\"\n          effDate=\"2011-04-12\"&gt;\n    &lt;number&gt;557&lt;/number&gt;\n    &lt;size&gt;10&lt;/size&gt;\n&lt;/prod:product&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously, [http://datypic.com/prod] is a site maintained by the author, so I cannot add or DELETE any file on this site for my exercices while I'm reading this book. As a result I need to put both XML and XSD documents on my local hard drive (I'm using Linux Fedora Core 17 X86_64). So what I did, was to put the content of the schema in a file named for example '<strong>Example-01.xsd</strong>' and the XML content in a file named '<strong>Example-01.xml</strong>'. </p>\n\n<p>I use oracle PL/SQL package DBMS_XMLSCHEMA (Enterprise Edition 11.2.0.1.0) in order to first register the schema and then call the validate method of XMLType object in order to validate my XML document against the schema, similar to the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=2462207\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=2462207</a></p>\n\n<p>I have created a directory (by CREATE DIRECTORY) statement in oracle : </p>\n\n<p>/home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/</p>\n\n<p>Where I put both my XML &amp; XSD documents. Here is precisely how I changed the above mentioned XML content in order to refer to XSD locally</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;prod:product xmlns:prod=\"http://datypic.com/prod\" \n              xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n              xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://datypic.com/prod file:///home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/Example-01.xsd\"\n               effDate=\"2011-04-12\"&gt;\n    &lt;number&gt;557&lt;/number&gt;\n    &lt;size&gt;10&lt;/size&gt;\n&lt;/prod:product&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if you compare the new XML content with the above mentioned example, the only thing that I added was <strong>file:///home/train/Documents/myutl_file_dir/Example-01.xsd</strong> at the end of the value of <strong>xsi:schemaLocation</strong> in order to refer to the local hard drive. I found this method, here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Dec/0161.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Dec/0161.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is that it doesn't work. When I run my script in order to validate the document by calling the schemaValidate() method of the XMLType object, here is oracle error message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n*\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-19030: Method invalid for non-schema based XML Documents.\nORA-06512: at \"SYS.XMLTYPE\", line 354\nORA-06512: at \"TRAIN2012.ZXML_PKG\", line 176\nORA-06512: at line 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I understand from the error message '<strong>Method invalid for non-schema based XML Documents'</strong> is that oracle has simply ignored the filepath that I defined for schema file and it considers that there has not been any schema declared for this XML document.</p>\n\n<p>Any idea? How can I deal with this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n\n<p>Dariyoosh</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","xml","script#","parsexml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":2,"question_id":13291622,"title":"Read XML string from ScriptSharp","body":"<p>I am trying to convert a XML string to a XML object in order to traverse its attributes and child nodes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Something like this in regular C#:\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmldocument.loadxml.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmldocument.loadxml.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>However the System.Xml library of Script# is different than .Net's and I cannot instantiate a new XmlDocument (no public constructor).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Or like this with jQuery:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7228141/how-to-parse-xml-using-jquery\">How to parse xml using jquery</a></p>\n\n<p>However I do not know how to call the non-static ParseXml(string) function in ScriptSharp's jQuery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Got the ParseXml function to work with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>XmlDocument doc = jQuery.Instance.ParseXml(objDictionaryItem.Body);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I get the error in WebKit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$p1: \"Object function (a,b){return new c.fn.init(a,b)} has no method\n  'parseXml'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html","xml","xslt"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":26,"score":-2,"question_id":13293883,"title":"Table format corrupted in IE","body":"<p>I am trying to make table working for IE but its pulling my hair because works fine in other browsers.

To do this it uses the PHP function xml_parse as seen below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (!($fp = @$file_function($url, 'rb'))) {\n   $this-&gt;error(\"Cannot open {$url}\");\n   return;\n}\n\nwhile (($data = fread($fp, 8192))) {\n   if ( defined ('LIBXML_BUG') ) {\n     # fix voor LIBXML BUG\n     $data=str_replace(\"&amp;\",\"XMLLIBHACK\",$data);\n    }\n    if (!xml_parse($this-&gt;parser, $data, feof($fp))) {\n\n                    printf('XML error in %s at line %d column %d',\n            $url,\n                    xml_get_current_line_number($this-&gt;parser),\n                    xml_get_current_column_number($this-&gt;parser));\n            unset ($this-&gt;items);\n     } \n}\nxml_parser_free( $this-&gt;parser );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As said the problem lays on the xml_parse function. On this line the whole page/script  stops working and returns only the contents written above this line. It is not returning any error while error_reporting is E_ALL and display_errors is On. When creating an error on purpose I see the error so error_reporting is working. The parser($this->parser) is created in another file. Wich is loaded(var_dumped $this->parser). </p>\n\n<p>The code where $this->parser is created (I believe this class is called MagpieRSS):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function create_parser($out_enc, $in_enc, $detect) {\n        if ( substr(phpversion(),0,1) == 5) {\n            $parser = $this-&gt;php5_create_parser($in_enc, $detect);\n        }\n        else {\n            $parser = $this-&gt;php4_create_parser($in_enc, $detect);\n        }\n        if ($out_enc) {\n            $this-&gt;encoding = $out_enc;\n            xml_parser_set_option($parser, XML_OPTION_TARGET_ENCODING, $out_enc);\n        }\n\n        return $parser;\n    }\n\n    /**\n    * Instantiate an XML parser under PHP5\n    *\n    * PHP5 will do a fine job of detecting input encoding\n    * if passed an empty string as the encoding. \n    *\n    * All hail libxml2!\n    *\n    */\n    function php5_create_parser($in_enc, $detect) {\n        // by default php5 does a fine job of detecting input encodings\n        if(!$detect &amp;&amp; $in_enc) {\n            return xml_parser_create($in_enc);\n        }\n        else {\n            return xml_parser_create('');\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n    * Instaniate an XML parser under PHP4\n    *\n    * Unfortunately PHP4's support for character encodings\n    * and especially XML and character encodings sucks.  As\n    * force to UTF-8 use admin settings to change this\n    */\n    function php4_create_parser($in_enc, $detect) {\n        if ( $detect ) {\n            $in_enc = 'UTF-8';\n        }\n\n       return xml_parser_create($in_enc);\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am out of ideas to solve this.

I'm working on this little site called 10winstreak and I'm trying to detect if a stream is live or not with javascript because our server that we run the site off of cant handle processing every single request with PHP. The basis of detecting if a stream is live or not is you go to their XML file and in one of their tags (if it's live) it will say something along the lines of true and often time the XML file on their site will be empty if a particular stream isn't live. for example if you have a twitch.tv stream for gamespot you go to <a href=\"http://api.justin.tv/api/stream/list.xml?channel=gamespot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://api.justin.tv/api/stream/list.xml?channel=gamespot</a> and if it's got stuff in it then it's live if not then it's not. </p>\n\n<p>so basically my code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    function check (URL, term){\n    $.get(URL , function(data){\n        console.log(data);\n        //data is whatever the server returns from the request, do whatever is needed with it to show who is live.\n\n        var number = data.search(term);\n        if (number &gt; -1)            \n        {\n            document.write(\"Live\");\n        }\n\n        else \n        {   \n            document.write(\"Offline\");\n        }\n    });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and URL is a url that gets passed in and term is the term to search for in the xml file (usually \"true\" or \"True\"). but before anything happens I end up with \"XMLHttpRequest cannot load <a href=\"http://api.own3d.tv/liveCheck.php?live_id=6815\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://api.own3d.tv/liveCheck.php?live_id=6815</a>.

It would be alot of help for someone to show me what needs to be done to get rid of this error. of course if you can explain it to a non-coder like me it would be even more awesome but at my current point, as long as the code works for all I care it might as well be magic lol. </p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","xml"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":353,"score":2,"question_id":3844359,"title":"How to keep Rails from Processing Large XML Post","body":"<p>In our rails application we have a many actions that do regular webapp actions.

At first thought I felt this was not in conformance with the schema definitions (due to the <code>attributeFormDefault=\"unqualified\"</code> in <code>ns1</code>), but giving it a second thought it kind of makes sense. Here's how I understand it: the prefix is necessary because attributes <code>myAttrib1</code> and <code>myAttrib2</code> are not defined in the <del><code>targetNamespace</code></del> default namespace where they are used, i.e. they're not defined in <code>xmlns=\"http://www.test.com\"</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my questions: 1) have I understood the necessity of prefix said attributes correctly, and 2) where in the W3C rec. may I find a passage that describes this behavior?

This differentiation between qualified\n  and unqualified can be indicated by specifying the default values, as\n  above, but also when defining the elements and attributes, by adding a\n  form attribute of value qualified or unqualified.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is important to note that only local elements and attributes can be\n  specified as unqualified. All globally defined elements and attributes\n  must always be qualified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>found over at <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/11/29/schemas/part1.html?page=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">xml.com</a>. Another interesting source is <a href=\"http://zvon.org/xxl/XMLSchemaTutorial/Output/ser_attributeFormDefault.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">zvon.org</a>. So this really backs up the accepted answer. However, I have yet to see exactly where the (notoriously cryptic) W3C rec. mentions this in detail. After all, they are the governing body in this question.</p>\n"}]}

As described in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164135.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164135.aspx</a>, choice elements generate two fields: an Item field to hold the value and an ItemChoiceType field which holds a generated enum defining which named element is in the Item field.</p>\n\n<p>XSD creates a unique enum for each of these element name fields named ItemChoiceTypeXX, where XX is an integer. XSD creates as many of these ItemChoiceTypes as it needs and names them with incremented number.</p>\n\n<p>So, a small piece of my schema looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;xsd:choice&gt;\n  &lt;xsd:element ref = \"Sequence\"/&gt;\n  &lt;xsd:element ref = \"HandshakeId\"/&gt;\n&lt;/xsd:choice&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I can code to it like using the generated classes like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>job.Item = \"123\";        \njob.ItemElementName = ItemChoiceType26.Sequence;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that in the originally generated classes, the ItemChoiceType for this element was ItemChoiceType26. After updating the schema and regenerating the classes, the name is now ItemChoiceType27.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how do I manage this as the schema is updated and revised over time? I don't control the XSD schema, it is provided by a vendor. However, I do have to update my code to match changes they make. This seems like I'm facing a maintenance nightmare over time and would like any suggestions to better manage this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","xpath","simple-framework"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":109,"score":0,"question_id":12648363,"title":"XPath (SimpleXML) selection of child based on value of child's sibling","body":"<p>I'm using SimpleXML (Java) and I'm trying to get a List of objects based on the value of one of the siblings of the list.</p>\n\n<p>So, here's my XML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;xml&gt;\n  &lt;metadata&gt;\n    &lt;resources&gt;\n\n      &lt;resource&gt;\n        &lt;ittype&gt;Service_Links&lt;/ittype&gt;\n        &lt;links&gt;\n          &lt;link&gt;\n            &lt;path&gt;http://www.stackoverflow.com&lt;/path&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/description&gt;\n          &lt;/link&gt;\n          &lt;link&gt;\n            &lt;path&gt;http://www.google.com&lt;/path&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Google&lt;/description&gt;\n          &lt;/link&gt;\n        &lt;/links&gt;\n      &lt;/resource&gt;\n\n      &lt;resource&gt;\n        &lt;ittype&gt;Article_Links&lt;/ittype&gt;\n        &lt;links&gt;\n          ...\n        &lt;/links&gt;\n      &lt;/resource&gt;\n\n      ...\n\n    &lt;/resources&gt;\n  &lt;/metadata&gt;\n&lt;/xml&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I am trying to do is create a SimpleXML-annotation using XPath in order to get a List of all of the <strong>\"links\"</strong> where the list's sibling <strong>\"ittype\"</strong> equals <strong>\"Service_Links\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, this works but only if I'm trying to statically get the 1st <strong>\"resource\"</strong>-node (as opposed to dynamically getting the <strong>\"resource\"</strong>-node based on what it's sibling <strong>\"ittype\"</strong> is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@ElementList(name=\"links\")\n@Path(\"metadata/resources[1]/resource\")\npublic List&lt;Link&gt; link;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried so many ways to format the xpath to dynamically find the <strong>\"resource\"</strong>-node I want that I couldn't possibly list them all here; however, this is one example I've tried that seems to me it should work; no clue what I'm doing wrong...</p>\n\n<pre><code>@ElementList(name=\"links\")\n@Path(\"metadata/resources[resource/ittype='Service_Links']/resource\")\npublic List&lt;Link&gt; link;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've googled a ton, including here on SO, and just can't find much very similar; and what I did find, didn't translate well enough for me to spot what I need to do.

What is basically is, is a horse meeting, which contains it's races and the horses which ran in each race.</p>\n\n<p>I'm used to working with and seperating .csv files and have secured that, but the way things are going it's looking like I'm going to have to begin reading XML files and updating the database accordingly. Anyway, I'm a beginner to XML and vb .NET as a whole (a few month experience) and should probably not be jumping into such a complicated XML file so early on - I'll post my code below, and if somebody could point me in the right direction as to where I'm going wrong (probably a lot) and possibly provide me with some code/tutorials that will help me tackle this XML file then it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking to do is populate three different structures; Meeting, Race and Horse, with the corresponding information from the XML file. I can solve the database updating afterwards by myself, I believe (hopefully) :D</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Sub ExtractionService(ByVal spfile As FileInfo)\n        Dim strreader As New StreamReader(_sendpathname &amp; spfile.Name, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)\n        Dim xmlreader As XmlTextReader = New XmlTextReader(strreader)\n        xmlreader.WhitespaceHandling = WhitespaceHandling.None\n\n        Dim xmldoc As New XmlDocument()\n        xmldoc.Load(xmlreader)\n\n        Dim xml_nodelist As XmlNodeList = xmldoc.GetElementsByTagName(\"/HorseRacingCard/Meeting/Race/Horse\")\n\n        Dim mStatus As String\n        Dim mID As Integer\n        Dim mCountry As String\n        Dim mCourse As String\n        Dim mDate As Integer\n        Dim mDrawAdvantage As String\n        Dim mAdvancedGoing As String\n\n\n        For Each mxmlnode As XmlNode In xmldoc.GetElementsByTagName(\"Meeting\")\n            mStatus = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"status\").InnerText\n            mID = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"id\").InnerText\n            mCountry = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"country\").InnerText\n            mCourse = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"course\").InnerText\n            mDate = mxmlnode.Attributes.ItemOf(\"date\").InnerText\n            mDrawAdvantage = mxmlnode.SelectSingleNode(\"DrawAdvantage\").InnerText\n            mAdvancedGoing = mxmlnode.SelectSingleNode(\"AdvancedGoing\").InnerText\n\n            _meeting.meetingStatus = mStatus\n            _meeting.meetingID = mID\n            _meeting.country = mCountry\n            _meeting.course = mCourse\n            _meeting.meetingDate = mDate\n            _meeting.drawAdvantage = mDrawAdvantage\n            _meeting.advancedGoing = mAdvancedGoing\n        Next\n\n    End Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code manages to populate my meeting structure succesfully, but I just can't figure out I would go about populating the Race and Horse structures :( - I've followed a few tutorials and cannot seem to get my head around it.

Once these additions and changes have been highlighted, I believe I can then research these areas, and use the code which you guys can hopefully provide me with, to try tackle this.</p>\n\n<p>Again, all help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","xml","windows-mobile","compact-framework"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":846,"score":4,"question_id":2989536,"title":".NET compact framework - where to put files so that they are accessible to emulator","body":"<p>I have a .NET CF project.

If so it would make creating my objects much easier as I am planning on changing those array lists to hashmaps. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I haven't been clear...I'm not very good at describing these problems in text.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","xml","linq","linq-to-xml"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13203975,"title":"How to parse deeply nested using LINQ to XML","body":"<p>How do I parse the following XML using LINQ?<br>\nI need to insert into a database table <em>OrderNumber, ShipAddress, ShipCity, ShipState</em> for each <strong>Order</strong> &amp; <strong>OrderCancelled</strong>.<br>\nThen in a separate table I need to insert <em>OrderId</em> from the <strong>Returns/Amount</strong> section.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- language: lang-xml --&gt;\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;OrdersReport Date=\"2012-08-01\"&gt;\n&lt;Client&gt;\n&lt;ClientId&gt;1&lt;/ClientId&gt;\n  &lt;Orders&gt;\n    &lt;Order&gt;\n      &lt;OrderNumber&gt;1&lt;/OrderNumber&gt;\n      &lt;ShipAddress&gt;123 Main St.&lt;/ShipAddress&gt;\n      &lt;ShipCity&gt;MyCity&lt;/ShipCity&gt;\n      &lt;ShipState&gt;AZ&lt;/ShipState&gt;\n    &lt;/Order&gt;\n    &lt;Order&gt;\n      &lt;OrderNumber&gt;2&lt;/OrderNumber&gt;\n      &lt;ShipAddress&gt;111 Main St.&lt;/ShipAddress&gt;\n      &lt;ShipCity&gt;OtherCity&lt;/ShipCity&gt;\n      &lt;ShipState&gt;AL&lt;/ShipState&gt;\n    &lt;/Order&gt;\n    &lt;OrderCancelled&gt;\n      &lt;OrderNumber&gt;3&lt;/OrderNumber&gt;\n      &lt;ShipAddress&gt;111 Main St.&lt;/ShipAddress&gt;\n      &lt;ShipCity&gt;OtherCity&lt;/ShipCity&gt;\n      &lt;ShipState&gt;AL&lt;/ShipState&gt;\n    &lt;/OrderCancelled&gt;\n  &lt;/Orders&gt;  \n  &lt;Returns&gt;\n    &lt;Amount&gt;\n      &lt;OrderId&gt;2&lt;/OrderId&gt;\n      &lt;OrderId&gt;3&lt;/OrderId&gt;\n    &lt;/Amount&gt;\n  &lt;/Returns&gt; \n&lt;/Client&gt;\n&lt;Client&gt;\n&lt;ClientId&gt;2&lt;/ClientId&gt;\n&lt;!-- Same Tree structure as Client 1 --&gt;\n&lt;/Client&gt;\n&lt;/OrdersReport&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Based on the responses I got, I have updated the question.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var doc = XDocument.Load(rootFolder + \"Generic.xml\");\n    var query = doc.Descendants(\"Order\")\n                   .Concat(doc.Descendants(\"OrderCancelled\"))\n                   .Select(x =&gt; new\n                   {\n                       OrderNumber = (int)x.Element(\"OrderNumber\"),\n                       ShipAddress = (string)x.Element(\"ShipAddress\"),\n                       ShipCity = (string)x.Element(\"ShipCity\"),\n                       ShipState = (string)x.Element(\"ShipState\")\n                   });           \n\n    var amount = doc.Descendants(\"Amount\")                         \n                  .Select(y =&gt; new\n                  {\n                      OrderId = (int)y.Element(\"OrderId\")\n                  });\n\n    foreach (var o in query)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(o.OrderNumber + o.ShipAddress + o.ShipCity);\n    }\n    foreach (var r in amount)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(r.OrderId);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The amount enumeration is only giving me the first OrderId, what am I doing incorrectly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","xml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":2,"question_id":13204165,"title":"Using JavaScript to parse an XML file","body":"<p>I am new to Stack OverFlow and coding in general.

The code relating to Return Policy seems correct from the documentation that I have read, this is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;ReturnPolicy&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;ReturnsAcceptedOption&gt;ReturnsAccepted&lt;/ReturnsAcceptedOption&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;RefundOption&gt;MoneyBackorExchange&lt;/RefundOption&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;ReturnsWithinOption&gt;Days_14&lt;/ReturnsWithinOption&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;Description&gt;\"&amp;trim(ec(\"Ebay_Returns\"))&amp;\"&lt;/Description&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;ShippingCostPaidByOption&gt;Buyer&lt;/ShippingCostPaidByOption&gt;\"\nxmlStr=xmlStr&amp;\"&lt;/ReturnPolicy&gt;\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope that gives enough for someone to go on? Sorry if it's a little vague, ebay intergration is not my forte but needs must. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","xml"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13197848,"title":"creating a php file that displays xml values","body":"<p>I have my xml file which works perfectly and is displaying correctly, now I am creating a php program that will allow ease to update it quickly and efficiently, here is my php script right now.

In case validations problems are to be reported back to the user there exists a more complex interface <code>ValidationAware</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>declarative</strong> validation, each action to validate gets its own validation file called <code>myactionname-validation.xml</code> in which the validators are declared using an XML description language.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>At the company where I work we are using the programmatic validation principle, with a small sized validation framework (written internally) to help reuse common validator patterns. I have just read in a struts2 book however, that declarative validation is the the preferred way to go. The book gives a lot of instructions on <em>how</em> to setup declarative validation, however it hardly touches the subject of <em>why</em> the declarative way is preferable.</p>\n\n<p>I see some of the general arguments which are at times held in favor of declarative XML-style configuration, but I can't really see them to apply here: changing this configuration (i.e. validation) is something which is tightly coupled with the model processed by the action and the GUI used to modify values on the model. This is not something which needs to be configurable 'on-the-fly' without recompilation.</p>\n\n<p><em>What arguments are there to use declarative style validation in struts2?</em></p>\n\n<p>Is it worth it to dive into yet another XML markup dialect and bother with handling of the separate validation.xml files? Isn't it easier to do it programmatically, and maybe even more maintainable as Java source code (or rather your IDE of choice) will provide you with refactoring tools, structured search, etc. whereas XML config support is often tolerable at best?</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","xslt"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":2,"question_id":13195526,"title":"XPath Query to compare results are within numerical range","body":"<p>I have the following XML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;items&gt;\n    &lt;item&gt;\n        &lt;locations&gt;\n            &lt;location&gt;\n                &lt;latitude&gt;-100&lt;/latitude&gt;\n                &lt;longitude&gt;10&lt;/longitude&gt;\n            &lt;/location&gt;\n            &lt;location&gt;\n                &lt;latitude&gt;10&lt;/latitude&gt;\n                &lt;longitude&gt;10&lt;/longitude&gt;\n            &lt;/location&gt;\n        &lt;/locations&gt;\n    &lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;item&gt;\n        &lt;locations&gt;\n            &lt;location&gt;\n                &lt;latitude&gt;10&lt;/latitude&gt;\n                &lt;longitude&gt;10&lt;/longitude&gt;\n            &lt;/location&gt;\n            &lt;location&gt;\n                &lt;latitude&gt;10&lt;/latitude&gt;\n                &lt;longitude&gt;10&lt;/longitude&gt;\n            &lt;/location&gt;\n        &lt;/locations&gt;\n    &lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;items&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to count the items with invalid latitude or longitude values.</p>\n\n<p>Valid latitude is between -90 and 90.

With a full vertical sidewall and tip to tail wood core the BMX 88 has the makings of a powerful and unruly ski but has Kastle has seemed to tame the 88 down where it prefers smooth and driving arcs with a seemingly effortless transition edge to edge. When you take this ultra smooth hardpacked carve off the trail it still shines through with slight early rise in the tip and low camber for tremendous maneuverability and good flotation while doing most of the work for you. Using a dual radius sidecut allows you to vary the turn shape of the BMX 88 at any moment without the ski rearing up or fighting back, it simply lets you flex through and drive it where ever you please and a rubber damping layer eats up vibration so the ride is as smooth as the BMX 88. For the skier that wants off piste versatility but splits time evenly between hard and soft snow the BMX 88 is a ski that can handle the workload with a level of grace and ease you would expect from a top end small ski builder.&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/ski&gt;\n&lt;ski&gt;\n    &lt;skiId&gt;2&lt;/skiId&gt;\n    &lt;brand&gt;Line&lt;/brand&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Blend&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;A NEW BLEND OF ALL YOUR FAVORITE FREESTYLE SKIS.

The reduced swing weight feels like you don't have skis on your feet for floating pillow lines like a pro, ninja-like agility in the trees, and maching switch runs on the way to the park like you never left it.

My database (which I inherited) is poorly designed and the logic needed to decide upon a rows inclusion is complex.  Unfortunately, redesigning the database is not an option.  I'm vastly simplifying the logic here, so it's not a case where a simple join or where clause can be used.  There's a complex hierarchy to the data, and the data format definition.</p>\n\n<p>In psuedo code, the way-oversimplified decision would look something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n   --select our basic attributes\n\n     select XMLEMENT(\"product\",XMLELEMENT(\"productName\",name),XMLELEMENT(\"productNumber\",product_number))\ninto xml_output from products where product_number = 100;\n\n   --now process our obsolete rows\n   select XMLELEMENT(\"productObsoletes\") into xml_output from dual;\n   FOR c_row in (select * from product_obsoletes where id=100)\n   LOOP\n       IF c_row.display = 'YES' THEN\n        select XMLELEMENT(\"obsoletedProduct\", XMLATTRIBUTES(c_row.label as \"label\"), c_row.obsoleted_product_id) into xml_output from dual;\n       ELSE\n          CONTINUE;\n       END IF;\n   END LOOP;\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously though, this doesn't work.  First, XMLElement always puts a closing tag on, so unless you can formulate a single select statement containing all of your elements, it's not going to work. Second, in this example, I'd be overwriting the previous XMLELEMENT output.  I can't concatenate, because XMLELEMENT has already closed the tag.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I can think of at this point is to select the various XMLElement pieces I need into different VARCHARS and then use string manipulation functions to find the right spot to insert the various pieces.  Ugly with a capital-U.</p>\n\n<p>Is there another solution?  Is there perhaps a way to prevent XMELEMENT from closing the tag so that you can you use complex looping logic?  Or another Oracle construct which would allow me to achieve my goal of building up this XML without having to use a single select statement?</p>\n\n<p>My path of last resort would be to do the XML generation from another language such as Java or Perl where I could simply fetch the data and then do my complex processing and XML generation there.  However, I'd much prefer just to have a SQL function which would return the correct XML as a string, so if it's possible to do it in PL/SQL, that'd be my preferred route.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","xml"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":83,"score":-1,"question_id":13134316,"title":"Read XML Values in C#","body":"<p>I have XML file which i want to read through xpath in C#</p>\n\n<p>My XML will look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;doc&gt;\n     &lt;members&gt;\n        &lt;member test=\"testing\" name=\"T:QuexstBase.Tools.RegistryHelper.RegistryHelper\"&gt;\n            &lt;summary&gt;\n            RegistryHelper class to use registry operations.\n            &lt;/summary&gt;\n        &lt;/member&gt;\n        &lt;member test=\"testing\" name=\"F:QuexstBase.Tools.RegistryHelper.RegistryHelper.baseKey\"&gt;\n            &lt;summary&gt;\n            private member base key\n            &lt;/summary&gt;\n        &lt;/member&gt;\n        &lt;member  test=\"tester\"  name=\"F:QuexstBase.Tools.RegistryHelper.RegistryHelper.subKey\"&gt;\n            &lt;summary&gt;\n            default sub key\n            &lt;/summary&gt;\n        &lt;/member&gt;\n    &lt;/members&gt;\n&lt;/doc&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to read <strong>/members/member/@test</strong> whose value is testing.\nI don't want to use foreach or for loop for these.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","xml","ascii","utf"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":0,"question_id":10244099,"title":"Displaying variables with special characters \"$\" or \"-\" in the name","body":"<pre><code>stdClass Object\n(\n    [campaign-ID] =&gt; 1\n    [campaign_name] =&gt; Sample Campaign\n    [start_duration] =&gt; 2012-04-17\n    [end_duration] =&gt; 2012-04-17\n    [activity$] =&gt; \n    [survey_settings] =&gt; Ordering K-Cup Packs\n    [$limit] =&gt; sample\n    [$goal] =&gt; \n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How to remove the - and $ ? using php?\nBecause <code>-</code> and  <code>$</code> sign is valid in mysql, but when I'll try to display it using foreach, it wont work.

In fact, the XML\n  specification describes document-type\n  definitions (DTDs) as the way to\n  express a schema. In addition,\n  pre-release versions of the JAXB\n  Reference Implementation worked only\n  with DTDs -- that is, not with schemas\n  written in the XML Schema Language.\n  However, the XML Schema Language is\n  much richer than DTDs. For example,\n  schemas written in the XML Schema\n  Language can describe structural\n  relationships and data types that\n  can't be expressed (or can't easily be\n  expressed) in DTDs. There are tools\n  available to convert DTDs to the W3C\n  XML Schema Language, so if you have\n  DTD-based schemas that you used with\n  an earlier version of the JAXB\n  Reference Implementation, you can use\n  these tools to convert the schemas to\n  XML Schema Language. <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/jaxb/#binsch\">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/jaxb/#binsch</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess I would like examples that illustrate why XML-Schema is better (if it indeed is).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again,\nLEW</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","tsql","xquery"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":17,"score":0,"question_id":13130906,"title":"Query each node's inner content","body":"<p>I know that I can do this -</p>\n\n<pre><code>declare @args xml = '&lt;arg&gt;&lt;value&gt;hello&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;&lt;value&gt;world&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/arg&gt;';\n\nselect arg.value('value[1]', 'nvarchar(max)')\nfrom @args.nodes('//arg') args(arg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I'd like to do something like this (without the superfluous <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> tags) -</p>\n\n<pre><code>declare @args xml = '&lt;arg&gt;hello&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;world&lt;/arg&gt;';\n\nselect arg.value('?', 'nvarchar(max)')\nfrom @args.nodes('//arg') args(arg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What's the right XQuery expression?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","xml","arrays","simplexml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":29,"score":-1,"question_id":13130860,"title":"Getting data out of an SimpleXML Feed","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2849678/how-to-get-values-of-xml-elements\">How to get values of xml elements?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have the following data structure but I am unsure what sequance I would use to get the <code>id</code> out of the array.  </p>\n\n<p>I have another XML document that works fine and I have accessed the variables like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>$mainPropertyUrl = simplexml_load_file(\"URL\");\n$mainPropertyDetails = $mainPropertyUrl-&gt;Attributes;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the one below I have had to login via a HTTP Authentication Request and have used the following structure to generate belows code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation PHP:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>$oPMainUrl = 'HTTPS URI';\n$ch = curl_init();\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $oPMainUrl);  \ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, \"username:pw\");\n$result = curl_exec($ch);\ncurl_close($ch);\n\n$MainURI = simplexml_load_string($result);\n\n$ID = $MainURI-&gt;properties-&gt;property-&gt;id;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tried the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>PHP:</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>property[0]-&gt;attributes[3]-&gt;id;</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>XML:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>object(SimpleXMLElement)#112 (10) {\n  [\"@attributes\"]=&gt;\n  array(3) {\n    [\"approved\"]=&gt;\n    string(30) \"Sat Oct 27 17:57:29 +1300 2012\"\n    [\"last_updated\"]=&gt;\n    string(30) \"Sat Oct 27 17:57:29 +1300 2012\"\n    [\"id\"]=&gt;\n    string(6) \"278882\"\n  }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","xml","foreach","tree","nodes"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13130780,"title":"Trouble traversing XML file nodes","body":"<p>I have properly parsed one XML feed, and have inputted that data into a table on my site.

Take this instance document, which validates:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;root xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:q1=\"v2\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"v2 B.xsd\" xsi:type=\"q1:Derived\"&gt;\n  &lt;q1:b&gt;\n    &lt;v&gt;12.123&lt;/v&gt;\n  &lt;/q1:b&gt;\n&lt;/root&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Try to deserialize it with the generated code, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Base));\n    Bar p = (Bar)serializer.Deserialize(new FileStream(@\"..\\..\\test.xml\", FileMode.Open));\n    Console.Out.WriteLine(p.v);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You get 0.0 output, becaues v is default initialized.  Add the q1: prefix to the v element of the instance document, and it works, but is not valid.</p>\n\n<p>Would anyone agree that the this is the fault of the XML Schema definition tool?  I don't believe it's generating proper serialization code, but it's hard to blame the tools.  If we add XmlElement attributes with Namespace=\"\" to v, it works, but now I'm modifying the generated code, which is not desirable (the project I'm working generates the code as part of the build - we're not supposed to change it).</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas how I could work around this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","xml","math","symbols"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":859,"score":1,"question_id":8613884,"title":"How do I insert special characters as text in XML editor for Android?","body":"<p>So, I'm writing an app that involves using some mathematical symbols.

My first stab at it involved loading the file with Msxml2.DOMDocument, adding nodes and data as required, then saving the data back to disk. This worked well enough, except that it would not create tab and CR/LF whitespace in the new data. The solution I came up with was writing an XSL stylesheet that would recreate the XML file with whitespace added back in. I'm doing this by:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>loading the XSL file into an Msxml2.FreeThreadedDOMDocument object</li>\n<li>setting that object as the stylesheet property of an Msxml2.XSLTemplate object</li>\n<li>creating an XSL processor via Msxml2.XSLTemplate.createProcessor()</li>\n<li>setting my original Msxml2.DOMDocument as the input property of the XSL processor</li>\n<li>Calling transform() method of the XSL processor, and saving the output to a file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This works as for as reformatting the XML file with tabs and carriage returns, but my XML declaration comes out either as <code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-16\"?&gt;</code> depending on whether I used Msxml2.&#42;.6.0 or Msxml2.&#42; objects (a fall back if the system doesn't have 6.0).</p>\n\n<p>If the encoding is set to UTF-16, Msxml12.DOMDocument complains about trying to convert UTF-16 to 1-byte encoding the next time I run my package installer. I've tried creating and adding an XML declaration using both createProcessingInstruction() to both the XML and XSL DOM objects, but neither one seems to affect the output of the XSLTemplate processor.

One for each version. </p>\n\n<p>Shortcomming: I will need to create different classes for every parent class to call the right one.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>2)Version Parameter: Add to each method an Object with the version as a parameter. This way we will know what to do within each method according to each version.</p>\n\n<p>Shortcoming: Not clean at all. The code of different versions is mixed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>3)Inheritance + Version Parameter: Create 2 classes with a base class for the common code for the nodes that directly changes (Like InnerChild) and add the version as a parameter in each method. When a node call the another class to decode the child object, it will use one or another class depending on the Version parameter.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>4)Some kind of executor pattern(I do not know how to do it): Define at the start some kind of specifications object, where all the methods that are going to be used are indicated and I pass this object to a class that is in charge of execute them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>How would you do it?

If they are, the web service programmatically creates an XML document that has the same XML schema as the files created by the InfoPath template mentioned earlier.  The usual process is that a real user opens up this InfoPath template, fills out the data and clicks the SUBMIT button, which creates the XML document behind the scenes and saves it in the form library.  When the user goes into the form library to view that XML document later, the document automatically opens with the InfoPath template (instead of just opening as an XML document in Internet Explorer).</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to track down why my XML documents generated from the web service are behaving differently in that regard than the XML documents generated from InfoPath.  Here is the snippet of code I'm using to create the XML document inside the web service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        //specify path to the SharePoint site and the form library\n        var clientContext = new ClientContext(\"http://urlToSiteContainingTheFormLibrary\");\n        var site = clientContext.Web;\n        clientContext.Load(site);\n        var folder = site.GetFolderByServerRelativeUrl(\"FormLibraryNameHere\");\n        clientContext.Load(folder);            \n        clientContext.ExecuteQuery();\n\n        //create new file to add to the form library\n        var fci = new FileCreationInformation();\n        var encoding = new System.Text.UTF8Encoding();\n\n        //load the InfoPath document's XML schema from resources file\n        var baseXml = XElement.Load(new StringReader(Properties.Resources.BaseXml));\n        //fill out the appropriate elements and attributes of the XML here\n        //......\n        //\n\n        //set remaining properties of the new FileCreationInformation object\n        byte[] array = encoding.GetBytes(baseXml.ToString());\n\n        fci.Content = array;\n        fci.Overwrite = true;\n        fci.Url = \"DocumentName\"            \n\n        //add the new file to the form library\n        var newFile = folder.Files.Add(fci);\n        clientContext.Load(newFile);\n        var item = newFile.ListItemAllFields;\n        clientContext.Load(item);\n\n        //set metadata for the xml file here\n        item[\"HTML_x0020_File_x0020_Type\"] = \"InfoPath.Document.3\";\n        item[\"TemplateUrl\"] =\n            \"http://templateUrlHere/template.xsn?openin=preferclient&amp;amp;noredirect=true&amp;amp;xsnlocation=/templateLocation/template.xsn\";\n        //set remaining item properties......\n\n        //update changes to the item\n        item.Update();\n\n        //commit the changes\n        clientContext.ExecuteQuery();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, my XML document is successfully submitted to my form library, but when I go to open it, it opens as plain XML inside Internet Explorer instead of using the template I specified.  I would assume the HTML_x0020_File_x0020_Type and TemplateUrl properties of the item would specify enough information for SharePoint to know it needs to open this file using the InfoPath template, but maybe there is some other property specifically that I need to set.  Has anyone had any experience with a similar issue?  At first I thought the URL I was using for my template was wrong, but I copied it directly from an existing XML document that was created via the InfoPath template so I don't think that is the issue (I've left out any real URLs and filenames in my example code above, so please ignore the fact that those URLs are incorrect).  I am continuing to troubleshoot this, but in the meantime I thought someone might have solved this problem before and may be able to provide some insight.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any answers, I appreciate any help that is offered.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","maven","classloader","xerces"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":18,"up_vote_count":60,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1695,"score":60,"question_id":11677572,"title":"Dealing with \"Xerces hell\" in Java/Maven?","body":"<p>In my office, the mere mention of the word Xerces is enough to incite murderous rage from developers. A cursory glance at the other Xerces questions on SO seem to indicate that almost all Maven users are \"touched\" by this problem at some point.  Unfortunately, understanding the problem requires a bit of knowledge about the history of Xerces...</p>\n\n<h1>History</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Xerces is the most widely used XML parser in the Java ecosystem.  Almost every library or framework written in Java uses Xerces in some capacity (transitively, if not directly).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Xerces jars included in the <a href=\"http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#binary\">official binaries</a> are, to this day, not versioned.  For example, the Xerces 2.11.0 implementation jar is named <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and not <code>xercesImpl-2.11.0.jar</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Xerces team <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454?focusedCommentId=12881865&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3acomment-tabpanel#comment-12881865\">does not use Maven</a>, which means they do not\nupload an official release to <a href=\"http://search.maven.org/\">Maven Central</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Xerces used to be <a href=\"http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-general.html#faq-3\">released as a single jar</a> (<code>xerces.jar</code>), but was split into two jars, one containing the API (<code>xml-apis.jar</code>) and one containing the implementations of those APIs (<code>xercesImpl.jar</code>).  Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on <code>xerces.jar</code>.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as <code>xmlParserAPIs.jar</code>, which some older POMs also depend on.</p></li>\n<li><p>The versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this <a href=\"http://swordsystems.com/2011/06/29/xerces-and-xml-api-dependency-hell/\">here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>To complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the <code>com.sun.*</code> namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the <code>java.*</code> and <code>javax.*</code> APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization. </p></li>\n<li><p>Adding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their <code>/lib</code> folders.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Problems</h1>\n\n<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>\n\n<p>For some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many\norganizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their\nPOMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fe9Xa.png\" alt=\"xml-apis proxied by Artifactory\"> </p>\n\n<p>For example, organization A might publish xml-apis as:  </p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.xerces&lt;/groupId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, organization B might publish the same jar as:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;groupId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/groupId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;version&gt;1.3.04&lt;/version&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Although B's jar is a lower version than A's jar, Maven does not know\nthat they are the same artifact because they have different\n<code>groupId</code>s.  Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both\njars will be included as resolved dependencies:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4X1ts.png\" alt=\"resolved dependencies with multiple xml-apis\"></p>\n\n<h3>Classloader Hell</h3>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>s or as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).</p>\n\n<h1>Solutions?</h1>\n\n<p>We've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code> or as an <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (xml-apis, xerces, xercesImpl, xmlParserAPIs, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks/libs to use the JAXP version?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454\">XERCESJ-1454</a> that allows for upload to Maven Central.

In the case of Qt projects within Visual Studio, you end up with something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;Command Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'\"&gt;\"$(QTDIR)\\bin\\moc.exe\"  \"%(FullPath)\" -o \"..\\myproj\\moc_%(Filename).cpp\"  -DUNICODE -DWIN32 -DQT_LARGEFILE_SUPPORT -DQT_DLL -DQT_CORE_LIB -DQT_GUI_LIB -DQT_XML_LIB -DQT_SQL_LIB -DQT_OPENGL_LIB -DQT_QT3SUPPORT_LIB -DQT3_SUPPORT -DQT_SVG_LIB \"-I.\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtCore\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtGui\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtXml\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtSql\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtOpenGL\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\Qt3Support\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtSvg\" \"-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtTest\" \"-I..\\myproj\"&lt;/Command&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Yucky, but <em>c'est la vie</em>, especially with Microsoft. Unfortunatey, my <code>QXmlStreamWriter</code> object produces this (fully compliant) output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;Command Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'\"&gt;$(QTDIR)\\bin\\moc.exe&amp;quot; &amp;quot;%(FullPath)&amp;quot; -o &amp;quot;..\\myproj\\moc_%(Filename).cpp&amp;quot;   -DUNICODE -DWIN32 -DQT_LARGEFILE_SUPPORT -DQT_DLL -DQT_CORE_LIB -DQT_GUI_LIB -DQT_XML_LIB -DQT_SQL_LIB -DQT_OPENGL_LIB -DQT_QT3SUPPORT_LIB -DQT3_SUPPORT -DQT_SVG_LIB &amp;quot;-I.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtCore&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtGui&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtXml&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtSql&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtOpenGL&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\Qt3Support&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtSvg&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-I$(QTDIR)\\include\\QtTest&amp;quot; &amp;quot;..\\myproj&amp;quot;&lt;/Command&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Naturally, Visual Studio isn't impressed. What are my options here? I could probably read back the file and un-escape it, but that doesn't sound particularly efficient or intelligent.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","xml",".net-4.0","dataset"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1667,"score":2,"question_id":3702792,"title":"Dataset.ReadXML returns invalid characters in path.

Other settings not described in this document i want to read from default settings.</p>\n\n<p>Please follow this short example below.</p>\n\n<p>First xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;\n&lt;settings&gt;\n    &lt;option1&gt;\n        1\n    &lt;/option1&gt;\n    &lt;option2&gt;\n        2\n    &lt;/option2&gt;\n    &lt;option3&gt;\n        3\n    &lt;/option3&gt;\n&lt;/settings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Second xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;\n&lt;settings&gt;\n    &lt;option1&gt;\n        2\n    &lt;/option1&gt;\n&lt;/settings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The result is that when i create an default instances i want to use only server side config.\nWhen client will send settings to override i want to use this result to generate java objects:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;\n&lt;settings&gt;\n    &lt;option1&gt;\n        2\n    &lt;/option1&gt;\n    &lt;option2&gt;\n        2\n    &lt;/option2&gt;\n    &lt;option3&gt;\n        3\n    &lt;/option3&gt;\n&lt;/settings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>My question is: It's possible to use API of JaXB to make solution for this scenario ?\nMany thanks for prompt.</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,\nDaniel Macikowski</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","xml","rapidxml"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":0,"question_id":12860480,"title":"Rapidxml: adding subtree directly as value","body":"<p>I'm trying to append a very big subtree using rapidxml in a dirty way, exploiting the <code>value</code> method</p>\n\n<pre><code>rapidxml::xml_node&lt;&gt;* node = allocate_node(rapidxml::node_element, \"tree\");\nnode-&gt;value(\"&lt;very&gt;&lt;long&gt;&lt;subtree&gt;&lt;/subtree&gt;&lt;/long&gt;&lt;/very&gt;\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it but the angle brackets are expanded into <code>&amp;lt</code> and <code>&amp;gt</code> when I print the document.

However when installing on a Joomla 2.5, nothing showed up under the parameters. What is the priority for Joomla 2.5 and why it using the <code>manifest.xml</code> file with the install tags instead of the <code>mod_mymodule.xml</code> file?</p>\n\n<p>Does Joomla 2.5 prioritize an <code>&lt;install&gt;</code> tag at the top of an XML file over another XML file in the same directory with an <code>&lt;extension&gt;</code> tag?</p>\n\n<p>Manifest File:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;install type=\"module\" client=\"site\" method=\"upgrade\" version=\"1.5\"&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt; \n    &lt;author&gt;George Wilson&lt;/author&gt; \n    &lt;creationDate&gt;05-Mar-2012&lt;/creationDate&gt; \n    &lt;copyright&gt;&lt;/copyright&gt; \n    &lt;license&gt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html&lt;/license&gt; \n    &lt;authorEmail&gt;&lt;/authorEmail&gt; \n    &lt;authorUrl&gt;&lt;/authorUrl&gt; \n    &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt; \n    &lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;files&gt;\n            &lt;filename module=\"mod_mymodule\"&gt;mod_mymodule.php&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;manifest.xml&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;index.html&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;helper.php&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;folder&gt;assets&lt;/folder&gt;\n            &lt;folder&gt;tmpl&lt;/folder&gt;\n    &lt;/files&gt;\n\n    &lt;languages&gt;\n        &lt;language tag=\"en-GB\"&gt;language/en-GB/en-GB.mod_mymodule.ini&lt;/language&gt;\n    &lt;/languages&gt;\n\n    &lt;params&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"blah\" type=\"text\" default=\"5\" label=\"Label\" description=\"Description\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/params&gt;\n&lt;/install&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>mod_mymodule.xml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;extension type=\"module\" client=\"site\" method=\"upgrade\"&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt; \n    &lt;author&gt;George Wilson&lt;/author&gt; \n    &lt;creationDate&gt;05-Mar-2012&lt;/creationDate&gt; \n    &lt;copyright&gt;&lt;/copyright&gt; \n    &lt;license&gt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html&lt;/license&gt; \n    &lt;authorEmail&gt;&lt;/authorEmail&gt; \n    &lt;authorUrl&gt;&lt;/authorUrl&gt; \n    &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt; \n    &lt;description&gt;Description&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;files&gt;\n            &lt;filename module=\"mod_mymodule\"&gt;mod_mymodule.php&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;mod_mymodule.xml&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;index.html&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;filename&gt;helper.php&lt;/filename&gt;\n            &lt;folder&gt;assets&lt;/folder&gt;\n            &lt;folder&gt;sql&lt;/folder&gt;\n            &lt;folder&gt;tmpl&lt;/folder&gt;\n    &lt;/files&gt;\n\n    &lt;languages&gt;\n        &lt;language tag=\"en-GB\"&gt;language/en-GB/en-GB.mod_mymodule.ini&lt;/language&gt;\n        &lt;language tag=\"en-GB\"&gt;language/en-GB/en-GB.mod_mymodule.sys.ini&lt;/language&gt;\n    &lt;/languages&gt;\n\n    &lt;install&gt;\n        &lt;sql&gt;\n            &lt;file driver=\"mysql\" charset=\"utf8\"&gt;sql/install.mysql.utf8.sql&lt;/file&gt;\n        &lt;/sql&gt;\n    &lt;/install&gt;\n    &lt;uninstall&gt;\n        &lt;sql&gt;\n            &lt;file driver=\"mysql\" charset=\"utf8\"&gt;sql/uninstall.mysql.utf8.sql&lt;/file&gt;\n        &lt;/sql&gt;\n    &lt;/uninstall&gt;\n\n    &lt;config&gt;\n        &lt;fields name=\"params\"&gt;\n            &lt;fieldset name=\"basic\"&gt;\n                &lt;field name=\"moduleclass_sfx\" type=\"text\" default=\"\" label=\"COM_MODULES_FIELD_MODULECLASS_SFX_LABEL\" description=\"COM_MODULES_FIELD_MODULECLASS_SFX_DESC\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/fieldset&gt;                 \n        &lt;/fields&gt;\n    &lt;/config&gt;\n&lt;/extension&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Errors:\nBeneath position parameter:\n    ( ! ) Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in ROOT\\administrator\\components\\com_modules\\views\\module\\tmpl\\edit.php on line 50</p>\n\n<p>Beneath ordering parameter\n    ( ! ) Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\wamp\\www\\joomla25\\administrator\\components\\com_modules\\views\\module\\tmpl\\edit.php on line 61</p>\n\n<p>It also says <code>Module XML data not available</code> at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Upon inspection it is definitely the <code>manifest.xml</code> file that is installing rather than the <code>mod_mymodule.xml</code> that I want the Joomla 2.5 to use.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","xml","encoding","utf-8"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2118,"score":0,"question_id":2980896,"title":"How to encode 'á' to '&#225' with C# ??

Any suggestion of how to succesfully import this xml datafeed. </p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;product&gt;\n&lt;STOCK_CODE&gt;010003&lt;/STOCK_CODE&gt;\n&lt;UPC&gt;705077000440&lt;/UPC&gt;\n&lt;Basic_Description&gt;GABA 100GM&lt;/Basic_Description&gt;\n&lt;Brand&gt;AST Sports Science&lt;/Brand&gt;\n&lt;ProductLine/&gt;\n&lt;ItemName&gt;GABA&lt;/ItemName&gt; \n&lt;Title&gt;AST Sports Science GABA&lt;/Title&gt; \n&lt;Flavor/&gt;\n&lt;Supplier_Number&gt;1&lt;/Supplier_Number&gt;\n&lt;Supplier_Name&gt;AST SPORTS SCIENCE&lt;/Supplier_Name&gt;\n&lt;Primary_Category&gt;Amino Acids&lt;/Primary_Category&gt;\n&lt;General_Category&gt;Supplements&lt;/General_Category&gt;\n&lt;WHOLESALE_PRICE&gt;17.47&lt;/WHOLESALE_PRICE&gt;\n&lt;RETAIL_PRICE&gt;24.95&lt;/RETAIL_PRICE&gt;\n&lt;LIST_DATE&gt;2004-05-12&lt;/LIST_DATE&gt;\n&lt;DISC/&gt;\n&lt;CLT_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/CLT_QOH&gt;\n&lt;FRE_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/FRE_QOH&gt;\n&lt;MES_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/MES_QOH&gt;\n&lt;STR_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/STR_QOH&gt;\n&lt;WND_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/WND_QOH&gt;\n&lt;ORL_QOH&gt;Yes&lt;/ORL_QOH&gt;\n&lt;HasNutrition&gt;1&lt;/HasNutrition&gt;\n&lt;ValuePreparedCount&gt;0&lt;/ValuePreparedCount&gt;\n&lt;Address&gt;120 Capital Drive Golden, CO 80401&lt;/Address&gt;\n&lt;Copyright&gt;2007 AST Sports Science, Inc.&lt;/Copyright&gt;\n&lt;ItemSize&gt;100&lt;/ItemSize&gt;\n&lt;ItemMeasure&gt;g&lt;/ItemMeasure&gt;\n&lt;Height&gt;4.625&lt;/Height&gt;\n&lt;Width&gt;2.375&lt;/Width&gt;\n&lt;Depth&gt;2.375&lt;/Depth&gt;\n&lt;ProductWeight/&gt;\n&lt;MASS&gt;0.313&lt;/MASS&gt;\n&lt;ExtendedSize&gt;100 g (3.53 oz)&lt;/ExtendedSize&gt;\n&lt;CASE_QUANTITY&gt;12&lt;/CASE_QUANTITY&gt;\n&lt;Description&gt;GABA, Growth Hormone Potentiator&lt;/Description&gt;\n&lt;ProductDetails&gt;GABA is an amino acid classified as a neurotransmitter.

Its about Generating a Library of RuleML 1.0 Schemas</p>\n\n<p>The RuleML 1.0 schemas in Relax NG consist of a ‘backbone’ of named schemas enriched by a large number of parameter-defined schemas customizable via a schema generator, MYNG. This tool, written by Tara Athan in PHP, presents itself as a dashboard-like GUI, where users enter parameters of ten categories/facets describing what their RuleML 1.0 sublanguage ought to express. It then generates the desired schema in the Relax NG Compact (RNC) schema syntax, uniquely identified by a (query-parameterized) URL. For example, while there is an XSD-specified RuleML 1.0 sublanguage of Datalog with all relations restricted to being binary (bindatalog), the tool-supported schema parameterization permits the RNC-specified RuleML 1.0 to customize all sublanguages (not only Datalog) with such a binary restriction. The tool shall be used to systematically generate relevant RuleML 1.0 sublanguages in RNC, which shall then be used to validate sample instances. Based on this, a RuleML 1.0 Schema Library of interesting RNC specifications shall be built, tested, and illustrated with examples from any knowledge domain.\nThe Schema Library will be made available on the Web, open source, so it can be pointed to from the RuleML and MYNG sites.</p>\n\n<p>I think One good example will be an XML file which validates with the schema for Hornlog with Polyadic arguments, but does not validate for Hornlog with Binary arguments.\nso as Its required to generate schemas by using MYNG tool from this link.\n<a href=\"http://ruleml.org/1.0/myng/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ruleml.org/1.0/myng/</a></p>\n\n<p>for example we want to create a schema for binary horn log, MYNG will generate this schema and then may use OXYGEN to write example to ceate XML file syntax associated to the schema, and then test it to make sure this schema does validation syntax that is binary horn log .</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know does OXYGEN generate the XML file automatically from the schema I provide from MYNG or there is other way to create it?\nand How can I test the validation of the schema.

The following does not.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static Document toDocument(ResultSet rs) throws Exception\n    {   \n        DocumentBuilderFactory factory              = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n        factory.setNamespaceAware(true);\n        DocumentBuilder builder                     = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n        Document doc                                    = builder.newDocument();\n\n        URL namespaceURL = new URL(\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\");\n        String namespace = \"xmlns:xsi=\"+namespaceURL.toString();\n\n        Element messages = doc.createElementNS(namespace, \"messages\");\n        doc.appendChild(messages);\n\n        ResultSetMetaData rsmd                      = rs.getMetaData();\n        int colCount                                        = rsmd.getColumnCount();\n\n        String attributeValue = \"true\";\n        String attribute = \"xsi:nil\";\n\n        rs.beforeFirst();\n\n        while(rs.next())\n        {\n            amountOfRecords = 0;\n            Element message = doc.createElement(\"message\");\n            messages.appendChild(message);\n\n            for(int i = 1; i &lt;= colCount; i++)\n            {\n                Object value = rs.getObject(i);\n                String columnName = rsmd.getColumnName(i);\n\n                Element messageNode = doc.createElement(columnName);\n                if(value != null){\n                    messageNode.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(value.toString()));\n                }\n                else\n                {\n\n                    messageNode.setAttribute(attribute, attributeValue);\n                }\n                message.appendChild(messageNode);\n            }\n            amountOfRecords++;\n        }\n        logger.info(\"Amount of records archived: \" + amountOfRecords);\n\n        TransformerFactory tff = TransformerFactory.newInstance();\n        Transformer tf = tff.newTransformer();\n        tf.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, \"yes\");\n        tf.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, \"UTF-8\");\n        tf.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, \"yes\");\n\n        BufferedWriter bf = createFile();\n        StreamResult sr = new StreamResult(bf);\n        DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc);\n        tf.transform(source, sr);\n\n\n        return doc;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While I was testing the previous implementation I got an TransformationException: Namespace for prefix 'xsi' has not been declared. As you can see I've tried to add a namespace with the xsi prefix to the root element of my document. After testing this I still got the Exception. What is the correct way to set namespaces and their prefixes?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Another problem I have with the first implementation is that the last element in the XML document doesn't have the last three closing tags.</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","xsd"],"answer_count":8,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10722,"score":5,"question_id":950417,"title":"Validate XML against XSD software","body":"<p>What graphical software do you recomend to validate a XML file against XSD definition file?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","eclipse","eclipse-plugin","xacml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":553,"score":1,"question_id":6371733,"title":"Implementing a XACML editor based on an existing XML editor as a plugin","body":"<p>Here's what I was thinking of this morning:</p>\n\n<p>I need to define a lot of XACML Policies (which is an XML application) at the moment.\nSo far I've used the XML-Editor supplied with Eclipse and defined some templates to make things easier.

I thought a had a glimmer of hope with my last website <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30965/Read-XML-with-Namespace-resolution-using-XLinq-XEl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30965/Read-XML-with-Namespace-resolution-using-XLinq-XEl</a> but it failed as well. Each time I run the code below I get \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\" There seems to be many ways of parsing XML with C# but these namespaces are killing me. What am I doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Do keep in mind I am new to XML and C# and use to parsing JSON data. And yes I have Googled several way to parse XML data and nothing has be useful in this case. I can get XML without the namespaces to work but with them always has that error.</p>\n\n<p>C# Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code> XElement element = XElement.Parse(xml);\n\n XNamespace ns2 = \"http://mws.amazonservices.com/schema/Products/2011-10-01/default.xsd\";\n string val = element.Element(ns2 + \"ItemDimensions\").Element(ns2 + \"Heigth\").Value;\n                                Console.WriteLine(val);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>XML Data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ns2:ItemAttributes xml:lang=\"en-US\" xmlns:ns2=\"http://mws.amazonservices.com/schema/Products/2011-10-01/default.xsd\"&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Author&gt;Troelsen, Andrew&lt;/ns2:Author&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Binding&gt;Paperback&lt;/ns2:Binding&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Brand&gt;Apress&lt;/ns2:Brand&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Edition&gt;5&lt;/ns2:Edition&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:ItemDimensions&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Height Units=\"inches\"&gt;9.21&lt;/ns2:Height&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Length Units=\"inches\"&gt;7.48&lt;/ns2:Length&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Width Units=\"inches\"&gt;2.52&lt;/ns2:Width&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Weight Units=\"pounds\"&gt;5.80&lt;/ns2:Weight&gt;\n  &lt;/ns2:ItemDimensions&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:IsAutographed&gt;false&lt;/ns2:IsAutographed&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:IsEligibleForTradeIn&gt;true&lt;/ns2:IsEligibleForTradeIn&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:IsMemorabilia&gt;false&lt;/ns2:IsMemorabilia&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Label&gt;Apress&lt;/ns2:Label&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Languages&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Language&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Name&gt;english&lt;/ns2:Name&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Type&gt;Unknown&lt;/ns2:Type&gt;\n    &lt;/ns2:Language&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Language&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Name&gt;english&lt;/ns2:Name&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Type&gt;Original Language&lt;/ns2:Type&gt;\n    &lt;/ns2:Language&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Language&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Name&gt;english&lt;/ns2:Name&gt;\n      &lt;ns2:Type&gt;Published&lt;/ns2:Type&gt;\n    &lt;/ns2:Language&gt;\n  &lt;/ns2:Languages&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:ListPrice&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Amount&gt;59.99&lt;/ns2:Amount&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:CurrencyCode&gt;USD&lt;/ns2:CurrencyCode&gt;\n  &lt;/ns2:ListPrice&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Manufacturer&gt;Apress&lt;/ns2:Manufacturer&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:NumberOfItems&gt;1&lt;/ns2:NumberOfItems&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:NumberOfPages&gt;1752&lt;/ns2:NumberOfPages&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:PackageDimensions&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Height Units=\"inches\"&gt;2.60&lt;/ns2:Height&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Length Units=\"inches\"&gt;9.20&lt;/ns2:Length&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Width Units=\"inches\"&gt;7.50&lt;/ns2:Width&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Weight Units=\"pounds\"&gt;5.80&lt;/ns2:Weight&gt;\n  &lt;/ns2:PackageDimensions&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:PartNumber&gt;9781430225492&lt;/ns2:PartNumber&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:ProductGroup&gt;Book&lt;/ns2:ProductGroup&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:ProductTypeName&gt;ABIS_BOOK&lt;/ns2:ProductTypeName&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:PublicationDate&gt;2010-05-14&lt;/ns2:PublicationDate&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Publisher&gt;Apress&lt;/ns2:Publisher&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:SmallImage&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:URL&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51h9Sju5NKL._SL75_.jpg&lt;/ns2:URL&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Height Units=\"pixels\"&gt;75&lt;/ns2:Height&gt;\n    &lt;ns2:Width Units=\"pixels\"&gt;61&lt;/ns2:Width&gt;\n  &lt;/ns2:SmallImage&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Studio&gt;Apress&lt;/ns2:Studio&gt;\n  &lt;ns2:Title&gt;Pro C# 2010 and the .NET 4 Platform&lt;/ns2:Title&gt;\n&lt;/ns2:ItemAttributes&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["xml","json","wordpress","import","expressionengine"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":86,"score":0,"question_id":12865635,"title":"Best way to import content from Wordpress to Expression Engine","body":"<p>I've been asked to create a new Expression Engine site that will take the place of the current Wordpress run site.

nested loop in Nexpose XML results parser failing","body":"<p>I am trying to write a ruby script to take the Nexpose Simple XML results export, parse it, and write the required results out to a prettier format for easy review. I am using Nokogiri to parse the XML. My issue is that I have a nested loop that for each device, iterates through each service section and pulls out the name, port, and protocol attributes from each one. This will ultimately be printed back out to a file either a text file or a csv. However, my nested loops seems to only pull those three attributes from the first service section and prints them repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sample Input (there will be more than one of these device blocks):</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;device address=\"10.x.x.1\" id=\"20xx\"&gt;\n&lt;fingerprint certainty=\"0.85\"&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;vendor&gt;Microsoft&lt;/vendor&gt;\n&lt;family&gt;Windows&lt;/family&gt;\n&lt;product&gt;Windows&lt;/product&gt;\n&lt;version/&gt;\n&lt;device-class&gt;General&lt;/device-class&gt;\n&lt;architecture/&gt;\n&lt;/fingerprint&gt;\n&lt;vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;services&gt;\n&lt;service name=\"NTP\" port=\"123\" protocol=\"udp\"&gt;\n&lt;vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/service&gt;\n&lt;service name=\"HTTP\" port=\"8080\" protocol=\"tcp\"&gt;\n&lt;fingerprint certainty=\"0.75\"&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;Apache&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/device&gt;\n\n&lt;device address=\"10.x.x.2\" id=\"20xx\"&gt;\n&lt;fingerprint certainty=\"0.85\"&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;vendor&gt;Microsoft&lt;/vendor&gt;\n&lt;family&gt;Windows&lt;/family&gt;\n&lt;product&gt;Windows&lt;/product&gt;\n&lt;version/&gt;\n&lt;device-class&gt;General&lt;/device-class&gt;\n&lt;architecture/&gt;\n&lt;/fingerprint&gt;\n&lt;vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;services&gt;\n&lt;service name=\"DNS\" port=\"53\" protocol=\"udp\"&gt;\n&lt;vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/vulnerabilities&gt;\n&lt;/service&gt;\n&lt;service name=\"HTTP\" port=\"80\" protocol=\"tcp\"&gt;\n&lt;fingerprint certainty=\"0.75\"&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;Apache&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;/device&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Ruby Code:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'nokogiri'\n\ndoc = Nokogiri::XML(open('report.xml').read)\ndevice = doc.xpath('//device')\n\ndevice.each do |d|\n service = d.xpath('//service')\n puts d.attr('address')\n\n service.each do |s|\n   name = s.attr('name')\n   port = s.attr('port')\n   protocol = s.attr('protocol')\n\n   puts port\n   puts protocol\n   puts name\n end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Desired Output:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>10.x.x.1\n123\nudp\nNTP\n8080\ntcp\nHTTP\n\n10.x.x.2\n53\nudp\nDNS\n80\ntcp\nHTTP\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Actual Output:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>123\nNTP\nudp\n123\nNTP\nudp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the code should show a list of service port, name, and protocol for each service of each device. However, the current code seems to just print the set for the first service (which is 123, NTP, and udp) over and over and over.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something in the logic of my loop?

The reason I haven't tried this is because i didn't exactly know how to use it in combination with Net.WebRequest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set the header of the webrequest</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have no idea what to put in that header. But apparently some people(marked it as an answer and it did solve their problem, without stating what they exactly figured out from the answer. seeing stuff like \" Thanks, your code gave me an idea\" and thats it the post dies.</p>\n\n<p>And I got some other little changes that apparently fixed their issue's (which all of them i have tried).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What am I trying to do?</strong>\nWell I am trying send an xml to webservice and then get a response. The response part just goes wrong, with the internal server 500 error. The webservice should send back information. Note that I am not using a web reference, because apparently the WSDL doesn't work(So there won't be a solution in there.) So I am sending my code with the help of \"System.Net.Webrequest\".</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Dim req As System.Net.HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(System.Net.WebRequest.Create(url), Net.HttpWebRequest)\n    req.ContentType = \"text/xml\"\n    req.Method = \"POST\"\n    req.ContentLength = sentXml.Length\n    'the credentials are set somewhere in a string(these are correct)\n    req.Credentials = creds\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I proceed on writing the sentXml into getRequestStream variable. Then afterwards I call the getResponse method. And here is where it just refuses to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong>\nWhat should be my troubleshooting steps? Since I am new to webservices, what could I have forgotten or have done completely wrong? Anyone that could point me to the right direction would be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>best regards</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","xslt","xpath"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":2,"question_id":13013295,"title":"split string in xsl and update attribute","body":"<p>I have a xml file with below structure</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;project&gt;\n    &lt;dependency id=\"abc\" version=\"1.2.3.4\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/project&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to read this xml and update another xml with the value of id and version.

Unfortunately it didn't work for me.

I wonder if the query could be built with wildcards like <code>'%'</code> in SQL so that it is not necesary for the user to be that precise. I'm talking about a search box in the web page that implements a search of registered users. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: does anybody know how to deal with collation in MYSQL for spanish language, or knows if it's possible to build queries that kind of ignore accented characters? What about AJAX or XML DTD's. I've read this is an issue because PHP and MySql have different encodings to work with when they connect, for example PHP in my server has a Latin1 encoding, as returned by <code>mysql_client_encoding();</code>, but I havent got anything clear from reading about this anywhere. What is clear is that it has to do with byte size of encodings, but that's a topic too convoluted for me to understand in a simple way. </p>\n\n<p>I ask this because I tried to include a DTD on the XML with entities for every accented character, but it seems that the characters as they are read from MySql are already unrecognizable.

I don't really have rights to change the xsd (but could do so if really necessary).</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","xml","sql-server-2008","xpath","xquery"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":13000743,"title":"Concatenating text of child nodes into a single column","body":"<p>I'm working with an API that returns property information.

It is an informational app that does nothing but shows text and pictures about things. It has buttons that lead you through different categories and to the information at the end. It has one activity, and from that activity it calls different layouts. I am using the \"android:OnClick=\"\"\" method in xml to call the different layouts from the buttons. I am using soft back buttons which I don't mind but apparently is bad practice. \nThe problem is that when I hit the hard back button, it ends the one activity and kills the whole app and when the orientation changes, it always goes back to the starting layout associated with the one activity. I need some guidance as to if I should redo my entire app in a different way, or somehow track what layout I am in so it knows what to go back to. I've tried creating a separate activity for each layout and when I click the button, it seems to take longer to load than the way I am currently doing it and plus it's not as simple.</p>\n\n<p>My Code Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Button\n    android:id=\"@+id/audiocablesbutton\"\n    android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n    android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n    android:onClick=\"audiocables\"\n    android:text=\"@string/audiocablesbuttontext\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n    public void audiocables(View v) {\n    setContentView(R.layout.audiocables);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","xml","zend-framework","magento"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":12963908,"title":"Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend_XmlRpc_Value::getGenerator() magento","body":"<p>I was upgrading magento when something went wrong and now when I try to login to admin, I am unable to log in to back end admin of magento and I get the following error</p>\n\n<pre><code>Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend_XmlRpc_Value::getGenerator() in /home/boutique/public_html/app/code/core/Zend/XmlRpc/Request.php on line 413\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the code on respective lines is </p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n     * Create XML request\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function saveXml()\n    {\n        $args   = $this-&gt;_getXmlRpcParams();\n        $method = $this-&gt;getMethod();\n\n        $generator = Zend_XmlRpc_Value::getGenerator();\n        $generator-&gt;openElement('methodCall')\n                  -&gt;openElement('methodName', $method)\n                  -&gt;closeElement('methodName');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I cant understand why this issue is happening, I tried replacing request.php and response.php files from fresh download of magento..</p>\n\n<p>can body help me? why this eror is popping?</p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","xslt","xslt-2.0"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":1,"question_id":12961245,"title":"XSLT to remove instances of element in XML","body":"<p>I have an XML to which i need to apply a XSL to transform it to another XML with different schema version.\nThe two versions of schema is V1 and V2.

It says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The name attribute of the input and output elements provides a unique\n  name among all input and output elements within the enclosing port\n  type.  In order to avoid having to name each input and output element\n  within an operation, WSDL provides some default values based on the\n  operation name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In order to avoid naming each input/output elements, WSDL provides defaults. But why is that a RULE? Shouldn't it be a warning? \nCan't the developer provide the names by him/herself if he/she wants to? </p>\n\n<p>Further, I don't understand why this is a problem, since when the clients invoke the web service, they invoke with specific operation names called 'add' or 'subtract'. \nMy question finally is - As long as the operation names are different why should the parameter names matter? \nCan some one please explain the consequences of having the WSDL like this, if any ? </p>\n"},{"tags":["xml","r","install","rcurl"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":12921187,"title":"Error installing RCurl and XML packages on Windows","body":"<p>I am trying to install the RCurl and XML packages and getting an error on Windows.

But now i have to change by reading only the values within particular start and end tage. For the xml file mentioned above, i need to read <code>&lt;Name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Age&gt;</code> by default and then i have a function that returns the value \"I1\" or \"I2\" which is basically the element names. If it returns \"I1\" then i should read only the elements between <code>&lt;I1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/I1&gt;</code> and should not read <code>&lt;I2&gt;</code> and vice versa. So the code structure would be (just the logic please ignore the syntax errors) like</p>\n\n<pre><code>/******function that returns element name I1 or I2*********/\nstring elementName = func(a,b);\n\nxmlreader reader = reader.create(\"test.xml\");\nwhile(reader.read())\n{\n switch(reader.nodetype)\n {\n  case xmlnodetype.element:\n   string nodeName = reader.name\n   break;\n case xmlnodetype.text\n   switch(nodeName)\n   {\n     /*************Read default name and age values*******/ \n     case \"Name\":\n       string personName = reader.value\n       break;\n     case \"Age\":\n       string personAge = reader.value;\n       break;\n    /*******End of reading default values**************/\n\n    /*** read only elements between the value returned by function name above\n        If function returns I1 then i need to read only values between &lt;I1&gt; &lt;/I1&gt; else read &lt;/I2&gt;    and &lt;/I2&gt;**/   \n\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"}]}
