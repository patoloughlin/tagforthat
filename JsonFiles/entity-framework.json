I am trying to create an editable datagrid in a WPF app using a subset gathered from a LINQ query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpEvents = from d in ThisData.Events.Local\n                   where d.StartDate.Value.Date &lt;= DateTime.Now.Date &amp;&amp;\n                   (d.EndDate.HasValue == false || d.EndDate.Value.Date &gt;= DateTime.Now.Date)\n                   select d;\nRangeEventGrid.ItemsSource = LookUpEvents;\nRangeEventGrid.Items.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This query works, and the datagrid is populated however I am unable to edit the datagrid, when trying to this exception is thrown:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"'EditItem' is not allowed for this view.\"\n   at System.Windows.Controls.ItemCollection.System.ComponentModel.IEditableCollectionView.EditItem(Object item)\n   at System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.EditRowItem(Object rowItem)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When loading the full dataset using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ThisData.Events.Load();\nFullEventGrid.ItemsSource = ThisData.Events.Local;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works fine and the data is editable. The XAML used is identical (I have also tried swapping the bound datagrids and the full result remains editable and the query throws the exception still) and the only difference between these is the query. When I try to change the query I end up with a new exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The specified type member 'Date' is not supported in LINQ to Entities. Only initializers, entity members, and entity navigation properties are supported.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The query used for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpEvents = from d in ThisData.Events\n                   where d.StartDate.Value.Date &lt;= DateTime.Now.Date &amp;&amp;\n                   (d.EndDate.HasValue == false || d.EndDate.Value.Date &gt;= DateTime.Now.Date)\n                   select d;\nLookUpEvents.Load(); //Exception thrown here.\nRangeEventGrid.ItemsSource = LookUpEvents;\nRangeEventGrid.Items.Refresh();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The really weird thing about that exception (weird to me at least) is that I use DateTime comparison in other queries that do not throw any exceptions, for example this query in another place works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var LookUpSessions = from d in ThisData.Sessions\n                     where d.EndTime.Hour &gt;= (DateTime.Now.Hour - 1) &amp;&amp; d.StartTime.Hour &lt;= (DateTime.Now.Hour + 2)\n                     &amp;&amp; d.Event.IsActive == true\n                     orderby d.StartTime.Hour, d.StartTime.Minute\n                     select d;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it not possible to bind a LINQ query result to a DataGrid to be editable? That seems like it'd be a huge oversight if that's the case. I feel like it's much more likely I'm just missing something basic since LINQ, WPF and EF are all brand new to me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc","visual-studio","entity-framework","msdeploy"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3,"score":0,"question_id":13298598,"title":"Upon one-click publish: Exception in executing publishing: An item with the same key has already been added","body":"<p>I realize that a billion people have asked about this error, but I've looked at all of them.

I can do all of that, but I'm not sure what's the proper way to go about it while keeping code to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I have every field defined (from both the parent and child entity) in each of my view models. Is it better to have a \"parent\" view model and then deriving the child view models from it in order to mimic the inheritance structure of the entities? I wouldn't think so....having inheritance in view models doesn't make much sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I really don't want to duplicate CRUD operations for each grid. Is that considered good practice? Should each view model have its own set of CRUD operations in this case?</p>\n\n<p>Take 'Read' for instance. I'm basically returning JSON data based on the ID (key) field of the view model for each grid. And since all grids will have this ID column (part of the parent entity), should I only have one function that takes care of this for all grids? Should I be using reflections? Should I be making use of polymorphic properties of the parent/child entities?</p>\n\n<p>Or is it better to keep these operations separate for each grid?</p>\n\n<p>Hmmm..</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","linq","entity-framework","casting"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":125,"score":4,"question_id":13276806,"title":"Converting from IEnumerable<IEnumerable<string>> to ICollection<T>","body":"<p>I'm trying to convert an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;&gt;</code> to <code>ICollection&lt;Character&gt;</code> but struggling to figure out the right way to do it since the structure of one object is different than the structure of the other.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for conversion is to take a json deserialization and insert that into a database via Entity Framework.

One will notice that my latest UPDATED query above has an added \"new Customer\" within the .Select() where it was once anonymous.  I'm positive that is why the query failed b/c it couldn't be turn into a valid Uri due to LatestOrderDate not being a property of Customer at the Server level.

What I'm looking for is a way to fix this. Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.DomainClasses\n//POCO classes mapped on Entity Framework.\n\n//Project/Namespace DataAccessLayer.Base\n//Base classes and interfaces for all data access layer, such as:\n\npublic abstract class BaseContext&lt;TContext&gt; : DbContext where TContext : DbContext\n{\n  //To allow multiple contexts sharing the same connection string\n  protected BaseContext(): base(\"name=MyConnectionString\") {}\n}\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; : IDisposable where T : class\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write repository\npublic interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Basic implementation for a read-only repository\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Basic implementation for a read/write repository\npublic abstract class BaseRepository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where C : BaseContext&lt;C&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Project DataAccessLayer.AccountContext/ Namespace DataAccessLayer\n//Context class:\n\npublic class AccountContext : BaseContext&lt;AccountContext&gt; {}\n\n//With this, I can have simple repositories:\n\npublic class UserRepository : BaseRepository&lt;AccountContext, User&gt;\n{ //All implementation comes from the base abstract class, unless I need to change it (override methods)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have a service layer between data access and the application (Windows Forms). Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Project/Namespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services\n//Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.\n\n//Generic interface for a read-only service working with a read-only repository\npublic interface IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class {}\n\n//Generic interface for a read/write service working with a read/write repository\npublic interface IService&lt;T&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n\n//Base implementation for a read-only service\npublic abstract class BaseReadOnlyService&lt;T, R&gt; : IReadOnlyService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IReadOnlyRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Base implementation for a read/write service\npublic abstract class BaseService&lt;T, R&gt; : IService&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n    where R : IRepository&lt;T&gt;, new()\n{\n}\n\n//Concrete sample service\npublic class UserService : BaseService&lt;User, UserRepository&gt;\n{ //As with the repository I can change the default behavior of implementation overriding methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this setup, the only way to compile is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer project.\nHow can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework there?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs (DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code).</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><em>--Edit--Including here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the question--</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three (domain, base data layer and context). My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if it's really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, it's going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too? What's making VS require this?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, I'm inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.</p>\n\n<p>One possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=4.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to avoid having these references? What improvements can I have on this structure?</p>\n\n<p>What I know is that my app certainly doesn't have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. It's a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever (except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget).

Each dll added to the DbModel what it knew about itself. \nAny subsequent Seeding was also handled in the same wa (searching for a specific IDbSeeder contract, and executing it).</p>\n\n<p>Pro: \n* the approach works for now.\n* The same core DbContext can be used across all respositories, as long as each repo uses dbContext.GetSet(), rather than expecting it to be a property of the dbContext. No biggie.\nCons: \n * it only works at startup (ie, adding new modules would require an AppPool refresh).\n * CodeFirst is great for a POC. But in EF5, it's not mature enough for Enterprise work <em>yet</em> (and I can't wait for EF6 for StoredProcs and other features to be added).\n * My DBA hates CodeFirst, at least for the Core, wanting to optimize that part with Stored Procs as much as as possible...We're a team, so I have to try to find a way to please him, if I can find a way... </p>\n\n<p>Database-first:</p>\n\n<p>The DbModel phase appears to be happening prior to the DbContext's constructor (reading from embedded *.edmx resource file).  DbInitialization is never invoked (as model is deemed complete), so I can't add more tables than what the Core knows about.</p>\n\n<p>If I can't add elements to the Model, dynamically, as one can with CodeFirst, it means that \n* either the Core DbContext's Model has to have knowledge of every table in the Db -- Core AND every 3rd party module. Making the application Monolithic and highly coupled, defeating the very thing I am trying to achieve.\n* Or each 3rd party has to create their own DbContext, importing Core tables, leading to\n   * versioning issues (module not updating their *.edmx's when Core's *.edmx is updated, etc.)\n   * duplication everywhere, in different memory contexts = hard to track down concurrency issues.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it seems to me that the CodeFirst approach is the only way that Modular software can be achieved with EF. But hopefully someone else know's how to make DatabaseFirst shine -- is there any way of 'appending' DbSet's to the model created from the embedded *.edmx file?</p>\n\n<p>Or any other ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13260073,"title":"EF Code first lookup value without foreign key in model","body":"<p>I am working with a database that has two tables. \nIssues (contains a SubStatusID column that has int values. several of the rows have 0 value for this column)</p>\n\n<p>SubStatus table (contains SubStatusID, SubStatusText but there is no row with 0 value for SubStatusID...so I cannot use SubStatusID from this table as the foreign key association in my entity framework model).</p>\n\n<p>I also cannot change the data in any of the tables.</p>\n\n<p>When I pull the Issue record using EF 5, how can I also retrieve the value of the SubStatus column if Issue's SubStatusID is not 0</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","c#-4.0","expression-trees","dbcontext"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13274586,"title":"DBContext cache expression tree of a query","body":"<p>I'm actually working on a project who use a very big linq to entity query (around 250 lines) who works with a lot of different entities.</p>\n\n<p>This query depend of few parameters (3 or 4 max) so I think to \"store\" the expression tree of my query and modifying this one with just my few parameters like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Foo&gt; myQuery = \n  GetBaseQuery()\n  .Where(a =&gt; a.Param1 == \"foo\")\n  .Where(a =&gt; a.Param2 == \"bar\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Apart using compiled queries, is there a way to do that ? </p>\n\n<p>This problem has some conditions</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I use DbContext and changing to ObjectContext is difficialy possible and it seems that this is a pre requities for using compiled queries.</li>\n<li>I use Visual Studio 2010 so... i'm limited to .NET 4 and entity framework 4.3 (no .NET 4.5, EF5 and autocompiled queries unhopefully)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, Is there a way to</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Store an expression tree who will be just used as a \"base\" and will not take too much time to be generated ?</li>\n<li>Or using .NET 4.5 in visual studio 2010 ?</li>\n<li>Or using Compiled queries with a DbContext</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>REALLY Thank's by advance !!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":1,"question_id":13269433,"title":"Restrict DBSet to a subset of entities","body":"<p>I am building a multi-tenant application using EF 4, I have a shared database an many entities have a CustomerID field.

However, many times only a few filters will be used so I would like to generate the query in such a way that performance is improved for simpler queries. For example, if the filter criteria do not include employee ID, employee title, or employee state, there is no need for the query to do a join on the EmployeeAssignments table.</p>\n\n<p>I am attempting to use the PredicateBuilder found here <a href=\"http://petemontgomery.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/a-universal-predicatebuilder/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://petemontgomery.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/a-universal-predicatebuilder/</a> , which the author claims functions identically to the one included in LinqKit. My reason for using this PredicateBuilder rather than the one in LinqKit is that I am unable to cast the result of the LinqKit query to an ObjectQuery and call ToTraceString() to see the query which is generated. Although LinqPad would allow me to see the query that gets generated by LinqKit I would have to have our IT department install it on my computer and that has been painful in the past.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt at this produced code like the following:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;Department, bool&gt;&gt; departmentFilters = PredicateBuilder.True&lt;Department&gt;();\n\nif (IsValidParameter(managerID))\n    departmentFilters = departmentFilters.And(department =&gt; department.ManagerID == managerID);\n\nif (IsValidParameter(managerOfficeID))\n    departmentFilters = departmentFilters.And(department =&gt; department.Manager.OfficeID == managerOfficeID);\n\nif (IsValidParameter(managerState))\n    departmentFilters = departmentFilters.And(department =&gt; department.Manager.Office.State == managerState);\n\nreturn new DepartmentEntities().Departments.Where(departmentFilters);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this produces the following SQL:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-sql prettyprint-override\"><code>SELECT \n[Extent1].[DepartmentID] AS [DepartmentID], \n[Extent1].[Name] AS [Name], \n[Extent1].[ManagerID] AS [ManagerID]\nFROM    [dbo].[Departments] AS [Extent1]\nINNER JOIN [dbo].[Employees] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[ManagerID] = [Extent2].[EmployeeID]\nLEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[Employees] AS [Extent3] ON [Extent1].[ManagerID] = [Extent3].[EmployeeID]\nINNER JOIN [dbo].[Offices] AS [Extent4] ON [Extent3].[OfficeID] = [Extent4].[OfficeID]\nWHERE ([Extent1].[ManagerID] = @p__linq__0) AND ([Extent2].[OfficeID] = @p__linq__1) AND ([Extent4].[State] = @p__linq__2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This includes a superfluous join to Employees to get the manager information (Extent2 and Extent3). I understand why this is happening - when the query is constructed it has no way of knowing that the Manager I am talking about for both of the filters is the same.

In my Update method I choose to go with <code>_context.Entry&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> as apposed to <code>_context.Entry&lt;T&gt;(entity).State = EntityState.Modified</code> cause this throw the exception stating <em>An object with the same key already exists in the ObjectStateManager.

Let's say that the Profile at the client is that the Name property is John and the Addresses property contains 1 address.  If the client changes the Name to Steve and modifies the 1 Address all is good cause when ApplyStateChanges get called the DbEntityEntries for each get marked with the proper EntityState.  The problem comes about when the client adds a new Address to the Addresses collection with a State of 1 (Added).  When ApplyStateChanges gets called the call to <code>context.ChangeTracker.Entries&lt;IObjectState&gt;()</code> it does not return the newly added Address as an Entry that has changed by the ChangeTracker.</p>\n\n<p>I am pretty certain that the code <code>_context.Entry&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should be <code>_context.Entry&lt;T&gt;(entity).State = EntityState.Modified</code> but I can't seem to get around this exception no matter what I have tried.</p>\n\n<p>I am using EntityFramework 5.0 with .NET 4.0 meaning an EntityFramework version of 4.4.

Cleaning the solution, changing the connection string, changing the app.config file, restarting the machine, etc. doesn't help at all. If I rename the folder on the project, it'll work though. </p>\n\n<p>I'm honestly totally flummoxed as to what's going on. I'm fairly competent in and around VS 2010 and SQL Server, so I feel like I should be able to figure out what's going on.

The where criteria for every report will be the same, as an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code> crudEngine.Read&lt;ChildEntity&gt;()\n   .Include(parameters =&gt; parameters.ParentEntity)\n   .Where(parameter =&gt; parameter.ParentEntity.LastUser.Contains(searchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"year\", parameter.ParentEntity.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"month\", parameter.ParentEntity.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"day\", parameter.ParentEntity.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isDate &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DateAdd(\"dy\", SqlFunctions.DateDiff(\"dy\", \"1900-01-01\", parameter.ParentEntity.CreationDate), \"1900-01-01\") == dateSearchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"year\", parameter.ParentEntity.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"month\", parameter.ParentEntity.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"day\", parameter.ParentEntity.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n         (isDate &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DateAdd(\"dy\", SqlFunctions.DateDiff(\"dy\", \"1900-01-01\", parameter.ParentEntity.LastModifiedDate), \"1900-01-01\") == dateSearchText) ||\n          parameter.ParentEntity.CreationUser.Contains(searchText) ||\n          parameter.ParentEntity.Description.Contains(searchText)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This same criteria will be used for every child entity that references <code>ParentEntity</code>. If possible, I would like to somehow separate this where section into its own function like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private Predicate&lt;ParentEntity&gt; GetParentWhere(string searchText)\n    {\n        int intSearchText;\n        bool isInt = int.TryParse(searchText, out intSearchText);\n\n        DateTime dateSearchText;\n        bool isDate = DateTime.TryParse(searchText, out dateSearchText);\n\n        SubmissionStatus submissionStatus;\n        bool isStatus = Enum.TryParse(searchText, true, out submissionStatus);\n\n        return parent =&gt;                \n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"year\", parent.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"month\", parent.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"day\", parent.CreationDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isDate &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DateAdd(\"dy\", SqlFunctions.DateDiff(\"dy\", \"1900-01-01\", parent.CreationDate), \"1900-01-01\") == dateSearchText) ||\n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"year\", parent.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"month\", parent.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isInt &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DatePart(\"day\", parent.LastModifiedDate) == intSearchText) ||\n               (isDate &amp;&amp; SqlFunctions.DateAdd(\"dy\", SqlFunctions.DateDiff(\"dy\", \"1900-01-01\", parent.LastModifiedDate), \"1900-01-01\") == dateSearchText) ||\n               parent.CreationUser.Contains(searchText) ||\n               parent.Description.Contains(searchText) ||\n               parent.LastUser.Contains(searchText) ||\n               (isStatus &amp;&amp; parent.Status == (int) submissionStatus);\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then call this from my code, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        return crudEngine.Read&lt;ChildEntity&gt;().Include(parameters =&gt; parameters.ParentEntity)\n                         .Where(GetParentWhere(searchText));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't work however because the Where expression is typed with the child type, not the parent.

I would like to split one table across two entities.  Each of those entites contains a reference to a third entity.  The two references <strong>must</strong> be exposed with identical foreign key property names.  Since they map to columns in the same table, configuration (or, in this example, an attribute) is used to make the column names unique.</p>\n\n<p>When I try to load the model, I get the above exception from EF.  If I modify the name of one of the FK properties then the error goes away.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my model.  The code as-is works.  To reproduce the problem, rename <code>Foo2.Foo3Id1</code> to <code>Foo3Id</code>, which is the value that I need it to have.</p>\n\n<h1>Why Would You Want to Do That?</h1>\n\n<p>If you're wondering why I need the two properties to have the same name, here's the explanation.</p>\n\n<p>I have a table that contains several addresses (e.g. a postal address and a billing address).  This is an existing database, so I can't change the table structure.  Each address is represented by a series of standard columns.  The name of each column has a prefix identifying the kind of address and a suffix identifying the part of the address, e.g. <code>BillingAddressLine1</code>, <code>BillingAddressZipCode</code> and <code>PostalAddressLine1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>It would <em>seem</em> that using a complex type would handle this.  However, there is an added complication: each address contains a <code>CityId</code> that references a <code>Cities</code> table.  Complex types <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/7603303/439024\">don't support relationships and navigation properties</a>.  So my intended solution is to use table splitting instead, and to split each set of address properties into its own entity.  Each entity that represents an address either derives from a base type, say, <code>Address</code> or implements an interface, <code>IAddress</code>.</p>\n\n<p>With table splitting I'm careful to observe the restriction that where several types are mapped to the same table, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/11884110/439024\">they must all have navigation properties to each other</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the code below, <code>Foo1</code> and <code>Foo2</code> are both address types (and would implement some common interface).  <code>Foo3</code> is <code>City</code>.  This is the simplest repro of the problem that I could come up with.</p>\n\n<h1>Code Sample</h1>\n\n<pre><code>class Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        // Use NuGet to import EF 5 into the project.\n        // This code is just enough to cause the metadata to be loaded and therefore demo the error.\n        using (Context cx = new Context())\n        {\n            var qq = from f in cx.Foo3s\n                     where f.Foo1s.Any()\n                     select f;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n[Table(\"Foo\")]\npublic class Foo1\n{\n    [Key]\n    public virtual int Id { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    public virtual Foo2 Foo2 { get; set; }\n\n    [ForeignKey(\"Foo3\")]\n    [Column(\"Foo1_Foo3Id\")]\n    public virtual int?

After watching a few videos on Pluralsight, I decided to get creative and created an abstract base class that inherited from DbContext and exposed a single \"DataContext\" property that was a DbSet of a generic type. Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class BaseDataContext&lt;E&gt; : DbContext\n     where E : CustomEntity\n{\n      public DbSet&lt;E&gt; DataContext {get;set;}\n\n      public BaseDataContext()\n      {\n           Database.SetInitializer&lt;BaseDataContext&lt;E&gt;&gt;(null);\n      }\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seemed to be working great until I started dealing with entities that had relationships with each other (parent/child). What was occurring is when I tried to add a new child entity to the database via a data class that inherited BaseDataContext is instead of just attaching the reference (meaning, taking the child and say \"your parent key is 123\"), it created another record with a new key for the parent and all other fields duplicated and made this new record the parent of the child. I tried just setting the key property of my child (nulling out the property that was exposed with the data), but that didn't change anything. I found a thread on SO (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5823115/adding-user-to-a-role-inserts-a-duplicate-user-into-users-table\">here</a>) that said it wasn't a good idea to do multiple data contexts like what I was attempting to do and seemed to explain exactly what was happening.</p>\n\n<p>My question for this is, with the popularity EF seems to be gaining for everyone, is this the common approach? To create a single data context that is then passed around with constructors everywhere? Or is there a simpler way that is more common? This would especially apply if things get into background threads since passing a context there might get difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13212578,"title":"Defining foreign key constraints with Entity Framework code-first","body":"<p>I have following entity class called <code>Code</code>.

This causes the ROW_VERSION in the DB to be incremented (it is 2 now).</p></li>\n<li><p>The user of Client App 1 now changes some properties of entity object (which is still in memory with a ROW_VERSION of 1).</p></li>\n<li><p>Before Client App 1 saves the changes, it loads some other entity objects for display, and eventually selects the entity object in question again (e.g. to review the changes made). This causes a query where the result will contain the already changed entity object (because it is attached to the DbContext before the actual query is sent to the database).</p>\n\n<p><strong>And here is my problem: At this point the entity framework could compare the ROW_VERSION of the attached object with that of the object in the actual query result, detect a mismatch and e.g. throw an exception.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But instead the EF treats the ROW_VERSION property like all other properties which could just have been changed by the client.</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I wish the EF to treat the ROW_VERSION property specially and compare its values on every query to detect changes by other clients. This way I would detect concurrency situations earlier than when waiting for the SaveChanges call.</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","entity-framework-5"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7,"score":0,"question_id":13210738,"title":"EF5 , Widows Forms , Dragging a chield entity from project datasource into a GridView creates only 2 columns","body":"<p>After moved to EF5, created a diagram with 2 tables linked thru a FKey like Order/Order Details , then create a new project datasource with the Order object , dragging a column into a text box creates a binding source successfully , but then dragging the child entity OrderDetails into a gridview creates only 2 columns Count &amp; IsReadOnly .</p>\n\n<p>VS2010 or 2012 , same\n.NET 4.0 or 4.5 , same problem</p>\n\n<p>return to EF4 , problem solved</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","mono"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":247,"score":0,"question_id":9767223,"title":"Mono + Entity Framework using MS DLL?","body":"<p>I know Mono has no EF implementation, and no plans to create one. </p>\n\n<p>Would it be possible, however, to simply take the relevant DLLs from .NET and add them into my Mono project in MonoDevelop?

This is also accompanied with explanations that you want to keep the DAL separate from the domain and especially the view layer. But in the examples I've seen the repository is (or <em>appears to be</em>) simply returning DAL entities, i.e. in my case the repository would return EF entities.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, what good is the repository if it only returns DAL entities? Doesn't this add a layer of complexity that doesn't eliminate the problem of passing DAL entities around between layers? If the repository pattern creates a \"single point of entry into the DAL\", how is that different from the context object? If the repository provides a mechanism to retrieve and persist DAL objects, how is that different from the context object?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I read in at least one place that the Unit of Work pattern centralizes repository access in order to manage the data context object(s), but I don't grok why this is important either.</p>\n\n<p>I'm 98.8% sure I'm missing something here, but from my readings I didn't see it.

See 'EntityValidationErrors' property for more details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When looking for this EntityValidationErrors I receive the 2 following specific errors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The flg_actif field is required</p>\n  \n  <p>The user_creation field is required</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As mentionned before, those fields are filled with data just before saving so I don't understand what is happening.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using EF v4.0.30319 (system.data.entity=> v4.0 and EntityFramework=> v4.4)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong>\nJust to clarify a little bit more: The entity I'm trying to insert already exist in database. The form show the data of this database row. When saving, I decide if I update the row (this work well) but sometime, I need to insert the edited row as a new register instead of updating it to keep an history of the change in database.</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","asp.net-mvc","wcf","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":1,"question_id":13196887,"title":"jQuery Autocomplete tied to WCF Service ASP.NET MVC","body":"<p>New to ASP.NET MVC and programming, and I have searched high and low for materials on this subject but haven't found a concrete answer for my particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>The project I am working on requires the use of WCF services.

I added the DataAccess project and gave it a reference to a <strong>different</strong> EF (runtime 4.0.30319 v4.1.0.0).

Success!\nHowever, I thought I would double-check this, so I commented out the LazyLoadingEnabled parameter, did a clean rebuild and it still worked. I commented out the default constructor and now it still works - did something else change when I ran it with the LazyLoadingEnabled parameter in place?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linq","entity-framework","sql-server-ce"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13169788,"title":"DateTime logic in LINQ for SQL Server CE","body":"<p>My object 'Job' has <code>LastTimeFinishedRunning</code> which is <code>DateTime</code> and <code>RunIntervalMinutes</code> which is an <code>int</code>.

Once the data is imported the tool creates an intermediate model and performs some calculations on the input data and later throws the results in pre-defined format. The input table schema and intermediate model schema is fixed, no changes will happen. The extensibility is needed in the stage where the intermediate model is derived from the input data.

As of today (before the migration), the product gives the ability for the end users to create their own object types within the ASP .Net application from the admin interface. These object types are then translated to DB table creation/deletion/update both for the fields and the tables. Typically, one user can create a new MyCar object type from the end-user interface, create some attributes, and once validated he can then create new values. This is obviously reflected in the database as a new MyCar table, two fields, and new inserts.</p>\n\n<p>The main question I'm having relates to the way Entity Framework can be integrated so that we could as a first step query these tables through Linq queries. I know that ideally we should either use the code-first or the model-first approach but we want to proceed step by step.</p>\n\n<p>After making a few researches it turns out that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Entity Framework doesn't provide the ability to directly update the internal metadata</li>\n<li>We could take advantage of the dynamic Type creation so that the Entity Framework would be based on a code-first model (runtime, but still code-first :-)) and the dynamic queyword would allow us to retrieve the attributes through late binding.

Please tell me if I'm missing anything and if the approach described in the second bullet point seems to be the right answer for my problem. One of the challenge is also that fields or types can be created: if I have to go through runtime-created types using reflection I won't be able to do that. In this case I could use appdomains (and recreate a new one whenever I have to do a reset) but this could introduce new issues (accessibility / performance / entity framework incompatiblility with types defined in other appdomains / ...).</p>\n\n<p>I know quite well IQToolkit and I know how I could redefine the metadata at runtime easily without having to introduce .Net types - in this regard IQToolkit could be the prefered solution...</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestion are welcome!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","entity-framework","validation","data-annotation"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13156048,"title":"Database first and Wpf Entity Framework validation","body":"<p>I need to validate some user input in a c-sharp wpf desktop application.

For an explanation I wrote a small test program. At the end you'll find some questions I have about that.</p>\n\n<h2>Declaration</h2>\n\n<p>Here we have a class \"Test\" which represents our test dataset. It only has an ID (primary key) and a \"value\" property. In our TestContext we implement a DbSet Tests, which shall handle our \"Test\" objects as a database table.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public int value { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class TestContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet&lt;Test&gt; Tests { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Initialization</h2>\n\n<p>Now, we remove any (if existent) entries from our \"Tests\" table and add our one and only \"Test\" object. It has ID=1 (primary key) and value=10.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create a new DBContext...\nTestContext db = new TestContext();\n\n// Remove all entries...\nforeach (Test t in db.Tests) db.Tests.Remove(t);\ndb.SaveChanges();\n\n// Add one test entry...\ndb.Tests.Add(new Test { ID = 1, value = 10 });\ndb.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Tests</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, we run some tests. We select our entry by it's original value (=10) and we change the \"value\" of our entry to 4711. BUT, we do not call db.SaveChanges(); !!!</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Find our entry by it's value (=10)\nvar result = from r in db.Tests\n             where r.value == 10\n             select r;\nTest t2 = result.FirstOrDefault();\n\n// change its value from 10 to 4711...\nt2.value = 4711;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we try to find the (old) entry by the original value (=10) and do some tests on the results of that.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// now we try to select it via its old value (==10)\nvar result2 = from r in db.Tests\n             where r.value == 10\n             select r;\n\n// Did we get it?\nif (result2.FirstOrDefault() != null &amp;&amp; result2.FirstOrDefault().value == 4711)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"We found the changed entry by it's old value...\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When running the program we'll actually see \"We found the changed entry by it's old value...\". That means we have run a query for r.value == 10, found something... This would be acceptable. BUT, get receive the already changed object (not fulfilling value == 10)!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll get an empty result set for \"where r.value == 4711\".</p>\n\n<p>In some further testing, we find out, that the Entity Framework always hands out a reference to the same object. If we change the value in one reference, it's changed in the other one too. Well, that's ok... but one should know it happens.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Test t3 = result2.FirstOrDefault();    \nt3.value = 42;\nif (t2.value == 42)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Seems as if we have a reference to the same object...\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>When running a LINQ query on the same Database Context (without calling SaveChanges()) we will receive references to the same object, if it has the same primary key. The strange thing is: Even, if we change an object we will find it (only!) by it's old values. But we will receive a reference to the already changed object. This means that the restrictions in our query (value == 10) is not guaranteed for any entries that we changed since our last call of SaveChanges().</p>\n\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, I'll probably have to live with some effects here. But I, would like to avoid to \"SaveChanges()\" after every little change. Especially, because I would like to use it for transaction handling... to be able to revert some changes, if something goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I would be glad, if anyone could answer me one or even both of the following questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a possibility to change the behavior of entity framework to work as if I would communicate with a normal database during a transaction? If so... how to do it?</p></li>\n<li><p>Where is a good resource for answering \"How to use the context of entity framework?\" which answers questions like \"What can I rely on?\" and \"How to choose the scope of my DBContext object\"?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>EDIT #1</h2>\n\n<p>Richard just explained how to access the original (unchanged) database values. While this is valuable and helpful I've got the urge to clarify the goal ... </p>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at what happens when using SQL. We setup a table \"Tests\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Tests (ID INT, value INT, PRIMARY KEY(ID));\nINSERT INTO Tests (ID, value) VALUES (1,10);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we have a transaction, that first looks for entities whose values are 10. After this, we update the value of these entries and look again for those entries. In SQL we already work on the updated version, so we will not find any results for our second query. After all we do a \"rollback\", so the value of our entry should be 10 again...</p>\n\n<pre><code>START TRANSACTION;\n\nSELECT ID, value FROM Tests WHERE value=10; {1 result}\nUPDATE Tests SET value=4711 WHERE ID=1; {our update}\n\nSELECT ID, value FROM Tests WHERE value=10; {no result, as value is now 4711}\n\nROLLBACK; { just for testing transactions... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would like to have exactly this behavior for the Entity Framework (EF), where db.SaveChanges(); is equivalent to \"COMMIT\", where all LINQ queries are equivalent to \"SELECT\" statements and every write access to an entity is just like an \"UPDATE\". I don't care about when the EF does actually calls the UPDATE statement, but it should behave the same way as using a SQL Database the direct way... Of course, if \"SaveChanges()\" is called and returning successfully it should be guaranteed that all data was persisted correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Yes, I could call db.SaveChanges() before every query, but then I would loose the possibility for a \"Rollback\".</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Stefan</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","asp.net-mvc-4","ef-database-first"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13138429,"title":"Auto generate models in mvc 4 database first?","body":"<p>I created an mvc 4 web project using database first and entity framework but was surprised to see that default models were not generated automatically, is there a way to create them from my .edmx file or are there any other possibilities to save hand coding them?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: </p>\n\n<p>Sorry, should have mentioned I am looking for a solution to generate simple models with basic methods such as :</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class EditUserModel\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = \"Forename is required\")]\n    public string Forename { get; set; }\n\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = \"Surname is required\")]\n    public string Surname { get; set; }\n\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = \"Username is required\")]\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","linq","entity-framework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":13141862,"title":"Joining multiple tables using Entity Framework","body":"<p>i am trying to join 3 tables using EF but it throws an error saying </p>\n\n<pre><code>consider swaping conditions on either side of equals\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can some one pls help</p>\n\n<pre><code> var billdata = from billtotal in context.billTotals\n                                   join billcard in context.billClubcards\n                                       on billtotal.OrderID equals billcard.OrderID\n\n                                   join billtender in context.billTenders\n                                       on billtender.OrderID equals billtotal.OrderID\n\n\n                                   select billtotal;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","security","breeze"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":0,"question_id":13091760,"title":"Data Security using Entity Framework","body":"<p>What options/solutions are there for securing data using Entity Framework?</p>\n\n<p>I do not talk about forms login and such here, just assume that the users are authenticated or not.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate, i attached one of my web api controllers and i wonder if this is the way to do it.

Please help  </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Today i spend a whole day in this, i read a lot of articals and stackoverflow question. I found that <code>once a product is fetched from the Context, the context is keeping track of it</code> so that why instead of using :</p>\n\n<pre><code>db.Entry(ceremony).State = EntityState.Modified;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I used </p>\n\n<pre><code>db.Entry(db.Ceremonies.Find(ceremony.Id)).CurrentValues.SetValues(ceremony);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now by doing this change the exception gone and Ceremony entity properties are changing properly. But the ceremony related Menus entry and CourseOptions entry are not updating. Please give me suggestion guys.

Depending on some strategy we move that order up the chain in order to get it APPROVED.\nEvery change of status is logged so we can see a trace for statusses and maybe even an extra line of comment per status which can provide some extra valuable information to whoever sees this order in an interface.</p>\n\n<p>So an Order is linked to a Customer. One order can have multiple orderstatusses stored in OrderStatusHistory.</p>\n\n<p>In my testscenario I am using a customer which has 100+ Orders each with about 5 records in the OrderStatusHistory-table.\nI would for now like to see all orders in one page not using paging where for each Order I show the last relevant Status and the extra comment (if there is any for this last status; both fields coming from OrderStatusHistory; the record with the highest Id for the given OrderId).</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple scenarios I have tried, but I would like to see any potential other solutions or comments on the things I have already tried.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trying to do Include() when getting Orders but this still results in multiple queries launched on the database. Each order triggers an extra query to the database to get all orderstatusses in the history table. So all statusses are queried here instead of just returning the last relevant one, plus 100 extra queries are launched for 100 orders. You can imagine the problem when there are 100000+ orders in the database.</li>\n<li>Having 2 computed columns on the database: LastStatus, LastStatusInformation and a regular Linq-Query which gets those columns which are available through the Entity-model.\nThe problem with this approach is the fact that those computed columns are determined using a scalar function which can not be changed without removing the formula from the computed column, etc...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end I am very familiar with SQL and Stored procedures, but since the rest of the data-layer uses Entity Framework I would like to stick to it as long as possible, even though I have my doubts about performance.\nUsing the SQL approach I would write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WITH cte (RN, OrderId, [Status], Information)\nAS\n(\nSELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OrderId ORDER BY Id DESC), OrderId,    [Status], Information\nFROM OrderStatus\n)\nSELECT o.Id, cte.[Status], cte.Information AS StatusInformation, o.* FROM [Order] o\nINNER JOIN cte ON o.Id = cte.OrderId AND cte.RN = 1\nWHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId\nORDER BY 1 DESC;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which returns all orders for the customer with the statusinformation provided by the Common Table Expression.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know a good approach using Entity Framework?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc","performance","entity-framework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":1,"question_id":13103852,"title":"I want to improve performance of my Edmx by using AutoDetectChanges","body":"<p>I have a reasonably large edmx generated from a database and I have been working on performance recently to improve my application I have read a number of articles in a variety of places some here some not</p>\n\n<p>this one on disabling auto detect of changes <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj556205.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj556205.aspx</a> </p>\n\n<p>this one on improving performance on delete <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10103310/dbcontext-is-very-slow-when-adding-and-deleting\">DbContext is very slow when adding and deleting</a></p>\n\n<p>this one (which I think is pretty good) <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38922/Performance-and-the-Entity-Framework\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38922/Performance-and-the-Entity-Framework</a></p>\n\n<p>I am already using myentities.tablename.MergeOption = MergeOption.NoTracking, i am using compiledqueries, I am pregenerated my View using EdmGen, I have reduced the data I am fetching etc..  and, of course,  I have gained performance in leaps and bounds so that a page that was loading in 54 seconds is now taking 16.1 seconds - however I have to get it to 3 seconds So I am still looking for the next improvement </p>\n\n<p>so the research is all well and great and as a result  I have upgraded to the latest EntityFramework, I have regenerated my .edmx from db etc... and tried a variety of things but I simply cannot find a myEntities.Configuration.AutoDetectChangesEnabled in order to set it to false.

Here's an example of what I've got so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyUserSeeder : IEntitySeeder {\n    public void InitializeEntities(AssessmentSystemContext context, SqlConnection connection) {\n        context.MyUsers.Add(new MyUser { MyUserId = 106, ConceptPersonId = 520476, Salutation = \"Mrs\", Firstname = \"Novelette\", Surname = \"Aldred\", Email = null, LoginId = \"520476\", Password=\"28c923d21b68fdf129b46de949b9f7e0d03f6ced8e9404066f4f3a75e115147489c9f68195c2128e320ca9018cd711df\", IsEnabled = true, SpecialRequirements = null });\n        try {\n            connection.Open();\n            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(\"SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[MyUser] ON\", connection);\n            int retVal = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\n            context.SaveChanges();\n        }\n        finally {\n            connection.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So close and yet so far - because, although <code>cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()</code> works fine, when I then run <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, I'm informed that \"Explicit value must be specified for identity column in table 'MyUser' either when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to ON or when a replication user is inserting into a NOT FOR REPLICATION identity column.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, because MyUserId (which is the Identity column in the MyUser table) is the primary key, entity framework doesn't try to set it when I call <code>context.SaveChanges()</code>, even though I gave the <code>MyUser</code> entity a value for the <code>MyUserId</code> property.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to force entity framework to try and insert even primary key values for an entity, then?  Or maybe a way to temporarily mark <code>MyUserId</code> as not being a primary key value, so EF tries to insert it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","silverlight-4.0","entity-framework-4.1"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13099663,"title":"Not printing duplicate values using view in entity model","body":"<p>I am using entity model.i updated one view called SalesDetialView.</p>\n\n<p>In salesdetialview i have 3 entity keys.

Or is there some other way to trace it in the nuget console??</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","entity-framework"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":13091029,"title":"Update EF from an object","body":"<p>I know to update an object in EF I can do something like...</p>\n\n<pre><code>var hotel = context.Hotels.SingleOrDefault(u =&gt; u.HotelID == editedHotel.HotelID);\n    hotel.Name= editedHotel.Name;\n    hotel.Address = editedHotel.Address;\n    hotel.RoomCount = editedHotel.RoomCount;\ncontext.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but this gets quite long if a lot of fields need updating.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way I can do something like...</p>\n\n<pre><code>    var hotel = context.Hotels.SingleOrDefault(u =&gt; u.HotelID == editedHotel.HotelID);\nhotel = editedHotel;\ncontext.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...so all of the fields can be changed in one go?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","sql-server","entity-framework","foreign-keys"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13090735,"title":"inserting data into tables with foreign keys","body":"<p>I have 2 tables in ms sql server 2008 R2, one of which has foreign key relation to the other</p>\n\n<p>pretty simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tableA\nprefix nchar(10)\nvalue  nchar(50)\n\ntableB\nprefix nchar(10)\nvalue  nchar(50)\n\nALTER TABLE [dbo].[tableB]  \nWITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_TableA_TableB] FOREIGN KEY([prefix])\nREFERENCES [dbo].[TableA] ([prefix])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I fill in data in the tables using the management studio edit table. ensuring each prefix in <code>tableB</code> has a matching prefix in <code>tableA</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Then I import the tables into visual studio C# to create an entity framework model.\nEverything seem to work fine until I start to reference data in <code>tableA</code> from <code>tableB</code> using the navigation handle, it comes up empty handed.</p>\n\n<p>i.e. <code>tableB.tableA</code>s come out as null.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a step that needs to be done to update foreign key relations in entity framework and/or ms sql server?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","sql-server","database","entity-framework","sql-server-ce"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13085764,"title":"Generating both SQL Server CE database and entity model at runtime","body":"<p>I am developing a desktop application where different users can use the application on the same machine, the application should generate a different SQL Server CE database file for each user where the databases have the same schema (structure), and then generate an entity model from that database, how should I go about doing this ? </p>\n\n<p>I am new to both the Entity Framework and the SQL Server CE engine, so I am willing to consider any solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","automapper"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13052970,"title":"Auto-generating EF \"where\" clause based on DTO","body":"<p>I'm trying to autogenerate the parameter to IQueryable.Where so I can select entities from my entity framework code first data context without writing and wiring up a lot of tedious mapping code.</p>\n\n<p>My project contains a bunch of DTOs that look like:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FooDto\n{\n  public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n  public string SomeOtherProperty { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And a bunch of entities that look like:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\n  public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n  public string SomeOtherProperty { get; set; }\n\n  // Some other properties here.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The DTO contains the fields necessary to identify some subset of entities in my database.

So I added a new WCF Data Service, and changed the generated code just to test it, by adding the name of my entities class (as implemented in (1)) and the name of an entity set, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProjectService : DataService&lt;OrganizerEntities&gt;\n{\n    public static void InitializeService(DataServiceConfiguration config)\n    {\n        config.SetEntitySetAccessRule(\"Projects\", EntitySetRights.AllRead);\n        config.DataServiceBehavior.MaxProtocolVersion = DataServiceProtocolVersion.V2;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyway when I open the SVC in the browser I get a <em>Request Error</em>: <em>The server encountered an error processing the request. See server logs for more details.</em>. If I look at the log, I see first of all a warning like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... \n  http://msdn.microsoft.com/it-IT/library/System.ServiceModel.EvaluationContextNotFound.aspx\n  <strong>Configuration evaluation context not found</strong>.\n  ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and then an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong> exception whose details follow. In all the samples or tutorials I've found I see the typical not-so-real-world example where the data layer is not separated from the consumer application: create a new MVC app, add an EDMX, add a WCF Data Service, change some lines of generated code, and all magically works :). So I suppose this is related to my layered architecture, especially for the missing context warning. Could anyone help in using this service in a layered scenario like this? Thanks!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... Value cannot be null.

It just gets a count of 1 for each record in the database. It looks it does not know to group by an entire entity.

Is my only option to write the raw sql manually that will query the link table?</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","entity-framework-5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":13046149,"title":"Why disposed the ObjectContext instance?","body":"<p>can someone help me here, why I get the exception \"The ObjectContext instance has been disposed and can no longer be used for operations that require a connection.\" in the following section?</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public virtual IEnumerable&lt;TEntity&gt; Get(Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; filter, Func&lt;IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;, IOrderedQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;&gt; orderBy)\n    {\n        if (this.CheckAccess(this.OnCanRead))\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; baseFilter = this.GetFilter(this.OnFilter);\n\n                IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt; result = this.Set.AsQueryable();\n\n                if (baseFilter != null)\n                {\n                    result = result.Where(baseFilter);\n                }\n\n                if (filter != null)\n                {\n                    result = result.Where(filter);\n                }\n\n                if (orderBy == null)\n                {\n                    return result.ToList();\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    return orderBy(result).ToList();\n                }\n            }\n            catch (Exception)\n            {\n                throw;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new AccessException(\"CanRead\");\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Before calling the following point still exists the ObjectContext:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                if (baseFilter != null)\n                {\n                    result = result.Where(baseFilter);\n                }\n\n                if (filter != null)\n                {\n                    result = result.Where(filter);\n                }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why no longer?</p>\n\n<p><strong>- EDIT -</strong></p>\n\n<p>More Informations:</p>\n\n<p>Here the class using the function where the problem occurs:\n<a href=\"http://entityframeworkext.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/16211#382544\" rel=\"nofollow\">DbContextRepository</a> </p>\n\n<p>In my program, there is a class called ShopRepository, which is derived from:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ShopRepository : DbContextRepository&lt;Shop&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is a DataManager in my program what the problematic function is called: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class DataManager\n{\n    public static void Initialize()\n    {\n        Initializer.Initializer.SetInitializer();\n\n        ObjectFactory.Configure(\n           x =&gt;\n           {\n               x.For&lt;DbContext&gt;().Use&lt;DataContext&gt;();\n               x.For&lt;IUnitOfWorkFactory&gt;().Use&lt;DbContextUnitOfWorkFactory&gt;();\n           }\n        );\n\n        DbContextUnitOfWorkFactory.SetDbContext(CreateContext);\n    }\n\n    private static DbContext CreateContext()\n    {\n        return new DataContext();\n    }\n\n    private static ShopRepository _shops;\n\n    public static ShopRepository Shops\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (DataManager._shops == null)\n            {\n                DataManager._shops = ObjectFactory.GetInstance&lt;ShopRepository&gt;();\n            }\n\n            return DataManager._shops;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>- EDIT -</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have found the problem, but I do not know how to fix it. \nIf in the ShopRepository the event OnFilter a dynamic value is returned, such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>x =&gt; x.InstallationId == InstallationRepository.CurrentInstallationId\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then error occurs, if there a fixed value such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>x =&gt; x.InstallationId == 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is returned, no error occurs. </p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","entity-framework","production-environment"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":111,"score":2,"question_id":13048898,"title":"Entity Framework 5 - Code First Production Preparation","body":"<p>As part of our intended migration from Linq2Sql to Entity Framework, we have created a small EF model consisting of ten entities.

I work on a school project and there is quite complicated database containing energy consumption data. Those I need (<code>I</code> import, <code>E</code> export, reactive power <code>C</code> and <code>L</code>) are stored in one column as binary compressed so to get them out I have to use a stored procedure which calls some methods in custom assembly to decompress the column and restore the data.</p>\n\n<p>The stored procedure has 4 arguments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@identify int,\n@startTime datetime,\n@endTime datetime,\n@args nvarchar(60) -- \"Selector\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>selector</code> is rather special, it's an argument where you specify what you want in the result set, e.g. <code>'i'</code> for Import column only, <code>'i,e'</code> for Import and Export. They designed it like this because it's faster if you need just one column rather then all columns (because of the way the compressed data are stored).</p>\n\n<p>So, I've created an ADO.NET Entity Model called <code>EnergyConsumptionDBModel</code>, imported the stored procedure and created complex type <code>EnergyConsumptionResult</code> for the stored procedure return type as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class EnergyConsumptionResult\n{\n    public System.DateTime Time { get; set; }\n    public double I { get; set; }\n    public double E { get; set; }\n    public double L { get; set; }\n    public double C { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The column <code>Time</code> is always present in the result set, but the rest depends on the <code>@args</code> argument of the stored procedure. For example if I pick <code>'i,e,c,l'</code> as an argument, it will return columns <code>Time, I, E, C, L</code> and everything is just fine but if I pick for example <code>'i'</code> it returns <code>Time, I</code> which gives me an exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The data reader is incompatible with the specified 'EnergyConsumptionDBModel.EnergyConsumptionResult'.</em><br>\n  <em>A member of the type, 'E', does not have a corresponding column in the data reader with the same name.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the question is, is there some simple way to solve this? Some kind of dynamic result mapping on complex type or is it much more simple to tell my colleague who designed the stored procedure to make it return all columns whatever is in <code>@args</code> but leave the un-used columns empty which is a solution my project leader may not like.

Some tenants, particularly the newer ones, have very few rows, while others have many.</p>\n\n<p>SQL Server's query optimizer normally builds a query plan based on the parameters provided during its first execution, then re-uses this plan for all future queries even if different parameters are provided. This is known as <a href=\"http://www.sommarskog.se/query-plan-mysteries.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">parameter sniffing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem we have with our database is that SQL Server sometimes builds these plans based on parameters that point to a smaller tenant, which works fine for that tenant, but then when it reapplies the cached plan to a larger tenant it fails catastrophically (usually timing out, in fact). Typically we find out about this situation only when one of our larger tenants contacts us about experiencing time-out errors, then we have to get into the system and manually flush all the query plans to correct it.</p>\n\n<p>There is a query hint you can use to prevent SQL Server from caching query plans (<a href=\"http://www.benjaminnevarez.com/2010/06/how-optimize-for-unknown-works/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN</code></a>) but this results in some extra overhead since the query plan is being regenerated every time the query is called. An additional problem is that we're using Entity Framework which offers no ability to specify the <code>OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN</code> hint on queries.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is -- what is the best practice for multi-tenant databases with regard to parameter sniffing? Is there a way to disable parameter sniffing database-wide without having to specify it on every query? If so, is that even the best approach? Should I be partitioning the data in some other way? Is there some other approach I'm not thinking of?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","ado.net","ado.net-entity-data-model","savechanges"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":1,"question_id":13002616,"title":"How to add new object to database?","body":"<p>I want to add a new book to my database, but it doesn't work.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Knigi_DataEntities entities = new Knigi_DataEntities();\n                Books newBook = new Books();\n                newBook.Name = \"C# 4 How-to\";\n                newBook.Published = 2010;\n                newBook.Book_ID = 4;\n                entities.AddToBooks(newBook);\n                entities.SaveChanges();\n\n            Knigi_DataEntities ent = new Knigi_DataEntities(); \n                  foreach (var book in ent.Books)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"{0}, {1} {2}  \",\n                    book.Book_ID, book.Name, book.Published);\n                }\n              }\n            }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but when I close <code>//entities.SaveChanges();</code>, the console displays objects that are already in my database.

Using VS 2010 and SQL Server 2008 express DB.</p>\n\n<p>I was having trouble refreshing an Entity Data Model after adding new tables.  So, I followed a suggestion I found here to just delete and regenerate the model.</p>\n\n<p>I get to the \"Choose Your Data Connection\" section of the Entity Data Model Wizard and \"Save entity connection settings in Web.config as:\" is checked.  However, my existing name has a 1 appended to it.  For example MyDatabaseEntities is now MyDatabaseEntities1.  Of course, I don't want the \"1\" appended.  I killed the existing connection string in Web.config and removed all references to that name in my solution.  Yet when I try to continue I'm presented with the following error:  </p>\n\n<p>\"'MyDatabaseEntites' conflicts with an existing property name in the Application Settings.  Please choose a different name\"     </p>\n\n<p>I can't find a reference to that name anywhere in the solution.  I can uncheck that option and it will continue, but it STILL won't add two of the tables in the database.  Next, I completely shut everything down, rebooted, and tried again.  This time I didn't get the error above, but two of my three new tables still do not get added to the edmx model.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas are appreciated.  Also this seems like it's still pretty buggy even in VS2010/.NET 4.  Help restore my faith...I feel like abandoning Entity Framework at this point.  Based on my experience so far and some of the other issues posted here, I feel like I'm going to spend more time chasing Entity Framework strangeness than writing useful code.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:  I found a resolution.  The designer doesn't display errors.  You have have to look in the native XML (edmx file) to see the errors.

The model that is having issues looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class SubEntity {\n    [MaxLength(255)]\n    [Required]\n    [Key, Column(Order = 1)]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When we attempt to add a new <code>SubEntity</code> object to the context and save the changes, we get an error from SQL saying that we cannot set an explicit <code>Id</code>, and to use <code>IDENTITY_INSERT ON</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The code works fine on our local machines, and in our web server. The DB model is compatible, and we can create 'SubEntity' objects without issue.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems like EF, in the socket server environment, is ignoring the <code>[DatabaseGenerated]</code> Annotation when using a composite key. That would explain the error, and explain why the DB model is not compatible. Does this make sense?

Here's a example code I wrote just to test:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        using (DatabaseEntities e = new DatabaseEntities())\n        {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)\n            {\n                User u = new User();\n                u.Nome = \"User\" + i.ToString();\n                e.AddToUser(u);\n            }\n            int c = e.SaveChanges(true);\n\n            List&lt;User&gt; us = e.User.Where&lt;User&gt;(x =&gt; x.ID &lt; 50).ToList&lt;User&gt;();\n\n            foreach (User u in us)\n                Console.WriteLine(\"ID: \" + u.ID + \" Hello from \" + u.Nome);\n\n            Console.ReadKey();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run this I get the 50 outputs, if I look the content of the c variable in the debug, there's 50 changes, everythings seems to be fine, but when I start my query browser and look in the content of my MDF database, there's nothing there.</p>\n\n<p>Probably it's something very simple but I can't see what it is, I need your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linq","entity-framework","linq-to-entities"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":12974312,"title":"Entity Framework model.edmx and many to many relationships","body":"<p>In the database I have 3 tables, User, Group and a lookup table UserGroup which contains UserID and GroupId.</p>\n\n<p>I create a model.edmx and this allows me to:\nvar users = context.User\nvar groups = context.Group\nbut does not create an object for context.UserGroup.</p>\n\n<p>what is the syntax for getting all the users in a group, and all the groups that a user belongs to?</p>\n\n<pre><code>var results = from groups in db.Groups.Where(t =&gt; t.Users(u =&gt; u.UserID ==1))\nselect groups;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","entity-framework"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":106,"score":1,"question_id":12950145,"title":"WCF DataContractSerializer","body":"<p>I am getting the following error when trying to return a \nQuestionnaire object to the client.

I've read a dozen or more SO questions that were peripherally related to my issue, but so far none have matched up with what's going on.</p>\n\n<p>So, for performing audit-logging on our database transactions (create, update, delete), our design uses an IAuditable interface, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IAuditable\n{\n    Guid AuditTargetId { get; set; }\n\n    int? ContextId1 { get; }\n    int? ContextId2 { get; }\n    int? ContextId3 { get; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The three contextual IDs are related to how the domain model is laid out, and as noted, some or all of them may be null, depending on the entity being audited (they're used for filtering purposes for when admins only want to see the audit logs for a specific scope of the application). Any model that needs to be audited upon a CUD action just needs to implement this interface.</p>\n\n<p>The way that the audit tables themselves are being populated is through an AuditableContext that sits between the base DbContext and our domain's context. It contains the audit table DbSets, and it overrides the SaveChanges method using the EF ChangeTracker, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach (var entry in ChangeTracker.Entries&lt;IAuditable&gt;())\n{\n    if (entry.State != EntityState.Modified &amp;&amp; \n        entry.State != EntityState.Added &amp;&amp; \n        entry.State != EntityState.Deleted)\n    {\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise, make audit records!\n}\n\nbase.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The \"make audit records\" process is a slightly-complex bit of code using reflection and other fun things to extract out fields that need to be audited (there are ways for auditable models to have some of their fields \"opt out\" of auditing) and all that.</p>\n\n<p>So that logic is all well and good. The issues comes when I have an auditable model like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo: Model, IAuditable\n{\n    public int FooId { get; set; }\n\n    // other fields, blah blah blah...\n\n    public virtual Bar Bar { get; set; }\n\n    #region IAuditable members\n\n    // most of the auditable members are just pulling from the right fields\n\n    public int? ContextId3\n    {\n        get { return Bar.BarId; }\n    }\n\n    #endregion\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As is pointed out, for the most part, those contextual audit fields are just standard properties from the models. But there are some cases, like here, where the context id needs to be pulled from a virtual complex property.</p>\n\n<p>This ends up resulting in a <code>NullReferenceException</code> when trying to get that property out from within the SaveChanges() method - it says that the virtual Bar property does not exist. I've read some about how ChangeTracker is built to allow lazy-loading of complex properties, but I can't find the syntax to get it right. The fields don't exist in the \"original values\" list, and the object state manager doesn't have those fields, I guess because they come from the interface and not the entities directly being audited.</p>\n\n<p>So does anyone know how to get around this weird issue? Can I just force eager-loading of the entire object, virtual properties included, instead of the lazy loading that is apparently being stubborn?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long-ish post, I feel like this is a really specific problem and the detail is probably needed.</p>\n\n<p>TIA! :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12867141,"title":"Editing T4 files to customize entity class names and output file names","body":"<p>I'm using Entity Framework Reverse Engineer Code First on an existing database.

If it exists, no seed should be done.<br />\n<strong>DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges</strong>: It seems that InitializeDatabase method calls Seed() every time, no matter if the model changed or not. The call is outside the if(context.Dabase.Exists()) check. <br />\n<strong>DropCreateDatabaseAlways</strong>: It is obvious that this will always call Seed method.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Is this correct?

I can always have one huge unit of work but then this may take away all advantages that I get by using smaller and targetted bounded contexts.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","oracle","entity-framework","odp.net","sys-refcursor"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":106,"score":0,"question_id":12806485,"title":"What's wrong with my app.config configuration for ODP.Net and REF_CURSORS?","body":"<p>I've been struggling for a while with this, im following <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/oll/obe/EntityFrameworkOBE/EntityFrameworkOBE.htm#t3\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guide</a>:</p>\n\n<p>This are the steps I have taken so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create new console project</li>\n<li>Add new EntityModel</li>\n<li><p>Import \"Test\" Stored Procedure into Entity Model, sp looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CTACTE_WEB.TEST(P_SALIDA OUT NUMBER,\n                            P_CURSOR1 OUT sys_refcursor,\n                            P_CURSOR2 OUT sys_refcursor) IS\nBEGIN\n   P_SALIDA := 15;\n   OPEN P_CURSOR1 FOR\n   SELECT 125.72 \"DECIMAL\", 150 \"INTEGER\", 'JUST PASSING BY' \"TEXT\" FROM DUAL;\n\n   OPEN P_CURSOR2 FOR\n   SELECT 'JUST SOME TEXT' \"TEXT\" FROM DUAL;\n\nEND TEST;\n/\n</code></pre></li>\n<li>Add this to app.config:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursor.P_CURSOR1\" value=\"implicitRefCursor bindinfo='mode=Output'\" /&gt;  \n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursorMetaData.P_CURSOR1.Column.0\" value=\"implicitRefCursor metadata='ColumnName=DECIMAL;NATIVEDATATYPE=Number;ProviderType=Decimal'\" /&gt;  \n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursorMetaData.P_CURSOR1.Column.1\" value=\"implicitRefCursor metadata='ColumnName=INTEGER;NATIVEDATATYPE=Number;ProviderType=Int32'\" /&gt;  \n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursorMetaData.P_CURSOR1.Column.2\" value=\"implicitRefCursor metadata='ColumnName=TEXT;NATIVEDATATYPE=Varchar2;ProviderType=Varchar2'\" /&gt;  \n</pre>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursor.P_CURSOR2\" value=\"implicitRefCursor bindinfo='mode=Output'\" /&gt;\n&lt;add name=\"CTACTE_WEB.TEST.RefCursorMetaData.P_CURSOR2.Column.0\" value=\"implicitRefCursor metadata='ColumnName=TEXT;NATIVEDATATYPE=Varchar2;ProviderType=Varchar2'\" /&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Then I try to import function from the Entity Model I created before but when I click obtain column information after selecting complex type nothing happens, it doesn't show the cursor like the <strong>obe</strong> tutorial.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>So I tried again today, and it's behaving differently this time.

Therefore, it has different <code>DbContext</code> classes. However, there are some entity types shared amongst them. So we can have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyFirstDataAccess : DbContext\n{\n    //constructor omitted\n    public DbSet&lt;SharedType&gt; MyEntities { get; set; }\n    public DbSet&lt;OtherType&gt; MyOtherEntities { get; set; }\n}\npublic class MySecondDataAccess : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet&lt;SharedType&gt; MyEntitiesWithSharedType { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, the actual entities are not shared.</p>\n\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n\n<p>Different parts of the program need only parts of the data. E.g. one part could use the entities of Type <code>SharedType</code>. So I created a generic interface that provides the data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IEntityProvider&lt;TEntity&gt; where TEntity : class\n{\n    DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt; Elements { get; set; }\n\n    void Dispose();\n    int SaveChanges();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Implementing the interface in the <code>DbContext</code> I added the <code>Elements</code> property, which would replace e.g. the <code>MyEntitiesWithSharedType</code> property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DbSet&lt;SharedType&gt; IEntityProvider&lt;SharedType&gt;.Elements { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This actually works. Different parts of the program can now work with any <code>DbContext</code> as long as it provides the needed data.</p>\n\n<p>I want to reuse some parts of the server in the client. Of course, the client does not have a <code>DbContext</code>, but retrieves its data via a WCF service from the server. Therefore, the <code>DbSet</code>cannot be used in the <code>IEntityProvider</code> interface, because this interface must be shared with the client. So I created another interface, which contains the <code>DbSet's</code> members I need:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IEntityCache&lt;TEntity&gt; : IEnumerable&lt;TEntity&gt;, IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;\n{\n    ObservableCollection&lt;TEntity&gt; Local { get; }\n\n    TEntity Add(TEntity entity);\n    TEntity Remove(TEntity entity);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is to get the <code>DbSet</code> as an <code>IEntityCache</code>. It cannot be cast directly, because the <code>DbSet</code> does not implement the interface, although it contains all its members. I tried some different approaches, but neither really worked:</p>\n\n<h2>Attempt 1</h2>\n\n<p>Create a subclass of <code>DbSet</code>, which implements the needed interface (--> class adapter).</p>\n\n<p>This does not work, because <code>DbSet</code> does not have any public or protected constructors. Therefore, the adapter class is not valid.</p>\n\n<h2>Attempt 2</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of using an adapter class, I tried to use an adapter interface, which derives from <code>IDbSet</code> and the necessary interfaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ICustomDbSet&lt;SharedType&gt; MyEntities{ get; set; }\nIEntityCache&lt;SharedType&gt; IEntityProvider&lt;SharedType&gt;.Elements { get { return MyEntities; } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This does not work, because EntityFramework does not set the <code>ICustomDbSet</code>. Probably because the value it would set, is no <code>IEntityCache</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n\n<p>While writing this question, I found a pretty good solution (which I will post as an answer). So why do I post this question, though? Firstly, I would like to know, if there are any other approaches that seem more reasonable and if my solution has some drawbacks. Secondly, the solution might help someone else. And thirdly, writing this question took a while and it would be a pity to throw it away :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":90,"score":1,"question_id":12551377,"title":"Enabling EF code first migrations V 4.3.1.0","body":"<p>I have worked with other migration projects and had no problem.  in my current project i seperated the migration and model projects.

Currently, I am passing the EF entity classes directly into some of my views in an MVC application.  This makes it easy to populate and save the views because I can just directly have a repository give me my populated EF class, and if my controller receives an EF entity class in a postback, I can (if validation is OK) pass that straight through to the repository to save it.  However, is this potentially a security risk?  If there are properties on an entity class that I don't want modified, could the client submit those properties back as part of the postback and modify them anyway?  For example, say I have a view to edit a user to which I pass this EF model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class User {\n    [Required]\n    public string Firstname { get; set; }\n    [Required]\n    public string Surname { get; set; }\n    public DateTime DOB { get; set; }\n    public bool IsDisabled { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I might expose <code>Firstname</code>, <code>Surname</code>, and <code>DOB</code> as editable form fields, but I don't want the user to be able to set <code>IsDisabled</code> and disable their account.

Below is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        //List&lt;Task&gt; tasks = MockDataStore.GetData()\n        //    .Aggregate(new List&lt;Task&gt;(), (accumulator, treaty) =&gt; { accumulator.AddRange(treaty.Tasks); return accumulator; })\n        //    .Where(x =&gt; x.AssignedTo.Equals(companyId) &amp;&amp; x.StatusId == statusId).ToList();\n\n        using (SCGREDbContext context = new SCGREDbContext())\n        {\n            List&lt;Task&gt; tasks = context.Treaties.Aggregate(new List&lt;Task&gt;(), (accumulator, treaty) =&gt; { accumulator.AddRange(treaty.Tasks); return accumulator; })\n                                .Where(x =&gt; x.AssignedTo.Equals(companyId) &amp;&amp; x.StatusId == statusId).ToList();\n            return tasks;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","transactions"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":54,"score":-1,"question_id":12863950,"title":"What does DbConnection.EnlistTransaction do?","body":"<p>What does DbConnection.EnlistTransaction do?\nThank you for your time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","entity-framework","entity-framework-5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":93,"score":0,"question_id":12855502,"title":"Attach and update boolean or int doesn't always work","body":"<p>Using Entity Framework 5, Given an object <code>messenger</code> that exists in the database, with bit property <code>published</code>, in previous versions of EF I would update it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using (var c = new EFContext())\n{\n    Data.Messenger cm = new Messenger { MessageId = messageId };\n    c.Messengers.Attach(cm);\n    cm.Published = newPublishedValue;\n    c.SaveChanges();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, using EF5, this works if <code>newPublishedValue</code> is <code>true</code>, but if <code>newPublishedValue</code> is <code>false</code>, no changes are made to the database.

Again for a many to one relationship, a simple DropDownList works fine with the ViewBag in the controller, and with this many to many multiselect/ListBox method the 'Divisions' show up in the view, however when the Save button is hit, the validation of '1, 2' is not valid is displayed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;div class=\"editor-label\"&gt;\n        @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Divisions)\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"editor-field\"&gt;\n        @Html.ListBox(\"Divisions\")\n        @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.Divisions)\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So as I understand it, the list of 'Divisions' are being grabbed properly from the database and selected correctly in the view but when saving to the database the association through the mapped relationship isn't being made.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are:\nHow do I make this work so when I save, the correct 'Divisions' are saved to the Employee?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I've heard people don't like using ViewBags, is there a (better?) alternate way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["database","wcf","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12803258,"title":"Load data, WCF services","body":"<p>Help me please!\nI have project on ASP.NET MVC, EF 4.5 and WCF services.\nProblem is that data from database are not loading to View.\nI traced host WCF project with debugger and saw logs in SvcTraceViewer and\nI saw similar errors for entities(which are not loading), but I cant stand what they mean.:</p>\n\n<p>Image with error description.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hmy6c.png\" alt=\"My errors\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","wcf","entity-framework","poco"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":64,"score":-2,"question_id":12810918,"title":"COLLECTION Fixed Size WCF Entity Framework","body":"<p>I have the following problem, my WCF service is pretty simple, send some entities from an entity framework context, which I have disabled the proxy generation and Lazy loading, but what happens is that when I have an entity which I add a reference entity arises me an exception that tells me that the collection has a fixed size.

I'm <code>Select</code>ing from an <code>IQueryable</code> and instead of creating a new object, I want to \"tweak\" the one that I'm projecting.  Here's what I want to be able to do (<code>context</code> is a <code>DbContext</code>, and I'm using a code-first approach):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var eventsToReturn =\n    ((IQueryable&lt;Event&gt;)\n        context.Events\n        .OrderByDescending(evnt =&gt; evnt.TakesPlaceOn)\n        .Skip(startAt)\n        .Take(numberToReturn)\n    )\n    .Select(evnt =&gt;\n        {\n            evnt.UnmappedUsersCount = evnt.Users.Count();\n            return evnt;\n        }\n    )\n    .ToList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is nice because Entity Framework doesn't have to actually get all the <code>User</code> entities associated with each event, and can use an aggregate <code>COUNT</code> function to simply get the number of users.  However, it doesn't work, because the <code>IQueryable</code> version of <code>Select</code> wants a lambda statement with no method body that can be converted into an expression tree.  So, while the above doesn't work, this does:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.Select(evnt =&gt; evnt)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and so does this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.Select(evnt =&gt; evnt.Users.Count())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have solved the problem, but my way seems rather long-winded.  Here's my approach:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var eventsToReturnData =\n    ((IQueryable&lt;Event&gt;)\n        context.Events\n        .OrderByDescending(evnt =&gt; evnt.TakesPlaceOn)\n        .Skip(startAt)\n        .Take(numberToReturn)\n    )\n    .Select(evnt =&gt;\n        new {\n            Event = evnt,\n            UnmappedUsersCount = evnt.Users.Count()\n        }\n    )\n    .ToList();\n\nvar eventsToReturn = eventsToReturnData\n    .Select(evntData =&gt; {\n        evntData.Event.UnmappedUsersCount = evntData.UnmappedUsersCount;\n        return evntData.Event;\n    })\n    .ToList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I'm projecting the main <code>Event</code> object into an anonymous object, as well as the one tiny <code>int</code> that I want to add to it, and then doing a whole new <code>Select</code> on <code>eventsToReturnData</code>, which works this time because <code>eventsToReturnData</code> is an <code>IEnumerable</code> (so the lambda can have a method body), just to tweak the <code>Event</code> object by setting the <code>UnmappedUsersCount</code> integer that I got from the first query.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a simpler or more elegant way to do this?  I want to avoid EF having to retreive all the users for each event, so it's no good just using <code>Event.Users.Count()</code> on what is returned by the <code>IQueryable</code>'s <code>Select</code> method.</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","entity-framework-4","entity-framework-4.1"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12724733,"title":"Error comes as a {\"Invalid object name 'dbo.TableName'.\"}","body":"<p>I'm using Entity Framework and MVC3,\nI have used Model First approch...\nI have used <em>Company</em> as a Base class and I have inherited the <em>Lead</em> Class from it. </p>\n\n<p>When I run the application its gives an error...</p>\n\n<p>This is Base Class</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\n    namespace CRMEntities\n    {\n        public partial class Company\n        {\n            public int Id { get; set; }\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is Lead Class (Child)</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace CRMEntities\n{\n    public partial class Lead : Company\n    {\n        public Lead()\n        {\n            this.Status = 1;\n            this.IsQualified = false;\n\n        }\n\n        public Nullable&lt;short&gt; Status { get; set; }\n        public Nullable&lt;bool&gt; IsQualified { get; set; }\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have added the controller,and in index view I have added this code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Default1Controller : Controller\n    {\n        private CRMWebContainer db = new CRMWebContainer();\n\n        //\n        // GET: /Default1/\n\n        public ViewResult Index()\n        {\n\n            return View(db.Companies.OfType&lt;Lead&gt;().ToList());\n         } \n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is DB and Model ...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRQP1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Its giving the inner error -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{\"An error occurred while executing the command definition.

I decided to keep the domain model in a separate project from the domain logic and use a relaxed approach to the presentation layer by passing the domain entities instead of DTO's since we really only have 1 front end right now.  </p>\n\n<p>We are going to be servicing a distributed layer soon, in addition to our main website and I will use DTO's there, but I am considering using DTO's in the main website also.  I am also wondering if I should bother to break out the framework code in the domain layer (IRepository, IUnitOfWork, Entity/Value object supertypes etc).  Well here, let me list out the questions I need feedback on:</p>\n\n<p>1) I was pretty diligent about not having an anemic domain model and also watched out for behavior that was specific to the presentation concerns.  Most of the business calculations that are needed are on the domain entities, is it ok for the presentation layer to call this behavior directly or should it instead call an application service that then calls the domain entities?  This would suggest to me that there is no reason to have the presentation layer know about the domain entities and instead could use DTO's.  Alternatively, I could have the DTO's expose these behaviors, but then I feel like I am robbing the domain entities.  So I guess that is 3 options (Rich domain objects called directly, service layer or dto with behavior) which is best?</p>\n\n<p>2) Right now I have a domain project, which has domain services, specifications and logic and is orchestrated by the application layer and separate project for the domain model (used by presentation layer and application layer).  I also have framework interfaces for generic repository and unit of work pattern here.  Should I break the framework stuff out into a separate project and combine the rest into one project?</p>\n\n<p>3) I want to reorganize my domain layer into aggregates, right now all of the domain model is organized by modules, basically all the types for each module are in one namespace.  Would it be better to organize the entities, value objects, services and other stuff by the aggregates?</p>\n\n<p>4) Should I use the Separated Interface pattern for infrastructure services that are basically .net framework helper library types?  For example configuration objects or validation runners?  What is the benefit there in doing so?</p>\n\n<p>5) Lastly, not many examples I have seen have used interfaces for domain entities.  Almost every object I have I prefer to pass around interfaces for dependency reasons and it makes testing much easier.  Is it valid to use interfaces instead of concretes?  I should mention that we use EF 4.3.1 (soon to upgrade to latest version) and I seem to remember that EF had a problem with using interfaces or something.  Should I be exposing interfaces instead of the domain entities?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Project Structure:</p>\n\n<pre>\nPresentation.Web\n     |       |\n     |    Application\n     |     |      |\nDomain.Model - Domain\n\n(Infrastructure.Data, Infrastructure.Core, Infrastructure.Security)\n</pre>\n\n<p>Explanation:\nPresentation.Web (MVC3 Web Project)</p>\n\n<p>Application \n -- Service Layer that orchestrates the domain layer and responds to requests from the presentation layer (get this update that).

Entity Framework already does all this, but unfortunately it needs a DB connection. I'm wondering is there a way to use EF for this without the database (on the client).</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know entity framework typically hits the database in 3 cases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When SaveChanges is called on the ObjectContext,</li>\n<li>When an entity is lazy loaded,</li>\n<li>When an ad-hoc LINQ or EFQL is called.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For #1, instead of using SaveChanges I could iterate over ObjectStateTracker for changed entities and call appropriate service methods instead (UpdatePerson, DeletePhone, ...)</p>\n\n<p>For #2 I can simply disable lazy loading, which is a feature you typically don't have anyway when you use DTOs, and use for example named fetch plans when retrieving.</p>\n\n<p>For #3 I could make use of .ToTraceString() or other tracing injection, which gives me raw SQL which I can send over the wire. The SQL string would surely be DB provider dependent, but that's a deployment concern. My reasoning is that if I need ad-hoc querying over the wire I also need some language for defining the query, so then why not use SQL directly, after all it is a query language, and a far better one than anything I could possibly write. I could then write my on IQueryProvider which in it's Execute just calls .ToTraceString on the original Linq query, sends the request to some PersonQuery service method and returns the result. I suspect this would be the most challenging part, but even if it doesn't fly it's not that important, it's the graph tracking that I'm after and ad-hoc queries would only be a plus.</p>\n\n<p>If it would work it would enable me to have free, state-of-the-art object graph tracking, the use of tools like EDM designer for designing and visualizing my DTOs, and the service interface would be usable to other apps as well, since it would expose universal operations, like <code>UpdatePerson(Person p)</code>, etc. It would also <em>force</em> me to write entity-centric service operations which should ease overall maintainability of the project (focus on one entity at a time).</p>\n\n<p>Before diving head-first into all this I thought I should ask here, does this even looks feasible?

I'm trying to use best practices so I have a set of DTO that get mapped to and from my Entities via AutoMapper.</p>\n\n<p>The real catch is when I'm trying to update an object.  The first gotcha was that I could not find a way to create a new entity, transfer the data from my DTO, and still have the entity ObjectContext realize that it has been changed. I used the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public VideoDTO UpdateVideo(VideoDTO pVideo)\n        {\n            Video video = new Video();\n            Mapper.Map(pVideo, video);\n            context.Attach(video); //Successfully attaches\n            context.ApplyPropertyChanges(\"Videos\", video);  // no changes made as far as entity knows b/c it was attached in it's updated state\n            context.SaveChanges(); //doesn't save the entity                \n            return pVideo;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then figured, perhaps I need to just grab the entity from the database first, attach to the context, call the Map method on Mapper, then call SaveChanges. Here what I did:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public VideoDTO UpdateVideo(VideoDTO pVideo)\n    {\n        Video video = context.Videos.Where(v =&gt; v.VideoId == pVideo.VideoId).FirstOrDefault();\n        Mapper.Map(pVideo, video); //Error here: Can't change VideoId value on Video entity\n        //context.Attach(video);\n        //context.ApplyPropertyChanges(\"Videos\", video);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n\n        return pVideo;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we get to the lovely EF issue of not being allowed to change the property, VideoId, because it's used by the EntityKey property on the Video entity. Lovely. I had setup the mappings so that when I mapped from my DTO to an EF Entity, the EntityKey property would get a value. Now I need a way to make an exception to that mapping rule, but have no clue where to begin. I suppose I could create a brand new Mapping rule right in this method and set the EntityKey &amp; VideoId properties to be ignored, but that seems pretty sloppy. Furthermore, I'm not sure a mapping created at this point would stick. If it overrode the initial setup that allowed the DTO to map a value to the EntityKey on the entity, that would backfire in a whole different way.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone have a better idea?</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","odp.net","odac"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":12738080,"title":"Multiple EF issues.

POCO/DTO has also been an alternative, not least for the clear separation against the clients.

On the project I am currently working on, the entire site is heavily integrated with the EF model. At first, the access to the EF context was being controlled using an IOC bootstrapper. For operational reasons we were not able to use IOC. I removed this and used a model of individual instances of the context object where required. I started getting the following exception:</p>\n\n<p><code>The type 'XXX' has been mapped more than once.</code></p>\n\n<p>We came to the conclusion that the different instances of the context were causing this issue.

The problem that this presents is that my Domain Models/Classes are defined in the Domain layer but the Context which creates and returns them is in the Data layer. In order for my context to know to return a \"Widget\" object it would need a reference to the Domain layer which defined the \"Widget\"</p>\n\n<p><b>My (failed) solution</b> : My solution was to create interfaces for each Domain Model and place them in the data layer. The context would return ... IdbSet ... These interfaces would, in turn, be implemented by the Domain Models, therefore keeping my data layer from directly needing to reference my domain (which causes illegal circular references anyway). The domain models were originally contructed using \"ADO.NET DbContext Generator w/WCF Support\" T4 templates. This process resulted in the inclusion of the [KnownType(typeof(IWidgetPiece))] at the beginning of of the widget class defin ition. (A Widget has a navigation property ...

Column names between the Alarms and ReasonAction tables do not match (SampleTagID and SampleTime for the Alarm table and Time and TagID for the ReasonAction table).</p>\n\n<p>So, my questions are: A.

I'll be using Visual Studio 2012 and I'll target .NET 4.5 and SQL Server 2008 or 2012. </p>\n\n<p>What I'm unsure about is whether or not to use Entity Framework, and if so, to what degree. As reading data from the database and then processing it will be the main job for this application, query performance will be important. I know that EF5 is a lot better than EF4.x in that respect, but it's not the inherent EF overhead that I'm most worried about (though something like Dapper is still at least twice as fast) but more the laziness it affords you as a developer, because querying too much is so easy through LINQ. So I want pure SQL queries to be the main way to fetch data. </p>\n\n<p>However, what I'll miss most about EF is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Compile time query checking.</li>\n<li>Change-tracking.</li>\n<li>Code first development.</li>\n<li>Unit of work pattern.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can live without the change tracking, it's usually not that hard to determine what's new or updated. </p>\n\n<p>What I do want is that the developers on this project will not have to mess around with table designers, but that they can simply write POCOs. So for that, I really appreciate EF's code first approach. With that, a developer can clone the source code, call <code>update-database</code> and have a working local database. It's something that has worked nicely for me in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that's very important to me is a unit of work pattern, or the atomicity of inserts and updates. I want to queue up all changes and have a single point where I call <code>SaveChanges</code>. With libraries like <code>DapperExtensions</code>, you get a <code>Insert</code> method, but it'll immediately do the database call. You can make it atomic by wrapping a transaction around it, but that's not the same as queuing it up. So I'd have to roll some sort of queuing mechanism myself for this.</p>\n\n<p>For the compile time query checking I consider using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). Queries would be stored procedures (to avoid big query string blobs in the C# code) and using SSDT these can be checked at build time. Another advantage of SSDT is that you can deploy the stored procedures from Visual Studio to a target database. And most importantly, the SQL scripts for these would live in source control.</p>\n\n<p>So with that, my solution would basically consist of three data access technologies:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entity Framework</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Would be responsible for creating the database from POCO datamodels.</li>\n<li>Would be used to insert/update data through its unit of work pattern. One caveat would be that you would first have to <code>Attach</code> entities you fetched through SQL to the context.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>SSDT</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Would be used to verify SQL scripts at compile time.</li>\n<li>Allows the scripts to live in Git.</li>\n<li>Would deploy the things EF can't deploy to your database.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Dapper/other Micro ORM</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Would be used to fetch data</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can't help but feel this is a bit of a Frankenstein solution where I use various bits and pieces of everything. I'm also not certain yet that SSDT and EF will work together in a nice way. This quick example seems to work fine though:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Combo of Dapper, EF and a stored proc that was published through SSDT\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n  var connectionString = ConfigurationManager\n    .ConnectionStrings[\"DbDataContext\"].ConnectionString;\n\n  using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n  using (var ctx = new DbDataContext())\n  {\n    conn.Open();\n\n    var product = conn.Query&lt;Product&gt;(\"GetProduct\", \n      commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure).First();\n\n    ctx.Products.Attach(product);\n\n    var order = new Order\n    {\n      Product = product\n    };\n\n    ctx.Orders.Add(order);\n\n    ctx.SaveChanges();\n\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This approach seems like it would work, but it's messy too. But if I give up SSDT, I'll miss out on compile time checking of SQL, if I give up Entity Framework, I'll miss out on code-first and easier inserts and if I give up on straight SQL I'll miss out on a big chunk of performance.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an alternative that I'm overlooking? If not, what's the best approach here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":12678633,"title":"Is there a GetObjectType in DbContext?","body":"<p>I'm using POCO proxies and I'd like to get the type of a object.

The DBA's I have to work with insist on my application connecting to the DB with a \"user\" schema while the tables and stored procedures are defined under another schema (let's just call it \"admin\").  They also require that the stored procedures are defined under a package within the DB (in the example this would be PKG1).</p>\n\n<p>I figured out that I could map my stored procedures into the EntityFramework model (using the \"admin\" schema), and by manually changing the \"Schema\" attribute to an empty string, I could connect and call the desired stored procedure from another schema (the \"user\" schema\") - as long as it wasn't defined in a package.  Once the stored procedure was placed in a package I had to manually add the \"StoreFunctionName\" attribute and provide it with the \"package name.stored proc name\" string as a value.  I could then call the stored procedure that was defined in the package.  While in debug mode, I could also manually change the StoreFunctionName in the edmx file, save the file and a subsequent call to the method invoking the stored procedure would succesfully call the stored procedure as defined in another package.  So any ideas on how I would make the change to the edmx file dynamically (it doesn't appear that published solution comes with the edmx file)?</p>\n\n<p>Update: OK, so the reason there is no edmx file is because the data is compiled into a dll.  I've been going through Brandon Haynes EFModelAdapter code but I'm still having trouble figuring out how to manipulate the StoreFunctionName value (or any of the \"FUnction\" node attributes for that matter). </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc","entity-framework","wcf-data-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":89,"score":1,"question_id":12572020,"title":"MVC with nested actions, WCF Data Service with EF5, and DataServiceQuery<>.Expand()","body":"<p>Consider this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var svc = new ProductDesignerEntities(AppSettings.ProductDesignerServiceLocation);\n\nvar scenariox = svc.Scenarios\n    .Where(o =&gt; o.ID == id)\n    .FirstOrDefault();\n\nvar scenario = svc.Scenarios\n    .Expand(o =&gt; o.SomeNavigationProperty)\n    .Where(o =&gt; o.ID == id)\n    .FirstOrDefault();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When this code runs, <code>scenario.SomeNavigationProperty</code> will be unpopulated.

I have two entities, ForecastLocation and Forecast:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ForecastLocation\n{\n    private ICollection&lt;Forecast&gt; _forecasts;\n    private decimal _longitude;\n    private decimal _latitude;\n\n    public int ForecastLocationId { get; set; }\n\n    public decimal Longitude \n    {\n        get { return Math.Round(_longitude, 1); }\n        set { _longitude = value; }\n    }\n\n    public decimal Latitude \n    {\n        get { return Math.Round(_latitude, 1); }\n        set { _latitude = value; }\n    }\n\n    public DateTime LastIssued { get; set; }\n\n    public virtual ICollection&lt;Forecast&gt; Forecasts \n    { \n        get { return _forecasts ?? (_forecasts = new List&lt;Forecast&gt;());}\n        set { _forecasts = value;}\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Forecast\n{\n    private decimal _temperature;\n    private decimal _cloudiness;\n\n    public int ForecastId { get; set; }\n\n    public DateTime TimePoint { get; set; }\n\n    public decimal Temperature \n    {\n        get { return Math.Round(_temperature, 1); }\n        set { _temperature = value; }\n    }\n\n    public decimal Cloudiness \n    {\n        get { return Math.Round(_cloudiness, 1); }\n        set { _cloudiness = value; }\n    }\n\n    public int ForecastLocationId { get; set; }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Every ForecastLocation object has a list consisting of forecasts. When a new forecast has been loaded and converted to a list of forecast objects, some of the timepoints will be overlapping (since the forecasts by the xml service are overlapping). However, it is assumed that new newest forecasts are more valid than the old ones in case of overlapping. This means that the forecasts with overlapping timepoints should be overwritten by the new forecasts and the rest of the new forecasts should be added to the list aswell.</p>\n\n<p>I have solved this temporarily by manually deleting the old forecasts that are overlapping and then simply adding all the new forecasts to the list in forecastlocation. This however, yields lots of database accesses.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void DeleteForecast(ICollection&lt;Forecast&gt; newForecasts)\n    {\n        var timePoints = (from o in newForecasts\n                          select o.TimePoint);\n\n        var oldForecasts = (from o in _context.Forecasts\n                            where timePoints.Contains(o.TimePoint)\n                            select o);\n\n        foreach (var oldForecast in oldForecasts)\n        {\n            _context.Forecasts.Remove(oldForecast);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One solution would perhaps to write custom SQL when deleting.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Entity Framework 5.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","ninject","repository-pattern","entity-framework-5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":326,"score":3,"question_id":12585664,"title":"An object with the same key already exists in the ObjectStateManager.

Thus, I tried having MyDbContext1 and MyDbContext2 connect to entirely different databases on different servers.

Ideally I would like to have an Entity Framework model (edmx file, etc) generated from a database using Add New Item - ADO.NET Entity Data Model (i.e. not Code First) in a separate assembly from my web application. However, when I set this up and use Add Controller, specifying \"MVC controller with read/write actions and views, using Entity Framework\" and choosing a Model class and Data context class from my DatabaseModel assembly the following alert message pops up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Mno' is not part of the specified\n  'Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Payforit4Entities' class, and the\n  'Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Payforit4Entities' class could not be\n  modified to add a 'DbSet' property to\n  it.

For example, the former has the POCO property holding the key indicated by a KeyAttribute whereas the latter holds that information in the edmx model files. Is this the rationale for the reverse engineer feature in Entity Framework Power Tools? Are we expected to move away from edmx files to reverse engineered Code First models in order to use MVC4 scaffolding?

However, once the <code>SubmitOperation</code> completes, inspecting <code>this._contactInfo.Entity;</code> in the debugger reveals that it has the correct data, however, the binding is never again re-evaluated to get the final value. Setting a breakpoint inside the <code>ContactInfo</code> setter method also shows that it is never invoked during the <code>SubmitOperation</code>, which would have caused the <code>RaisePropertyChanged(\"ContactInfo\")</code> notification to be called, allowing the binding to update.  </p>\n\n<p>I still don't know what is causing the <code>ContactInfo</code> binding to re-evaluate in the middle of a <code>SubmitOperation</code> nor why once <code>this._contactInfo.Entity;</code> has valid data in it again that <code>RaisePropertyChanged(\"ContactInfo\")</code> is not invoked.</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","entity-framework-5"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":176,"score":0,"question_id":12553973,"title":"Entity Framework 5 Foreign Key New Record on SaveChanges","body":"<p>I'm using .NET4.5/EF5 and have created the model from an existing database.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Order currentOrder = new Order();\nusing (var db = new ILSEntities())\n{\n    try\n    {\n        Event currentEvent = db.Events.OrderByDescending(u =&gt; u.EventID).FirstOrDefault();\n        currentOrder.Event = currentEvent;\n        db.Orders.Add(currentOrder);\n\n        db.SaveChanges();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I'm seeing that a duplicate record is being created of the Event object I find, which is not what I wanted to happen.</p>\n\n<p>I've read a lot of posts relating to similar problems, but where the context of the two participants in the foreign key relationships are different.

Why? Furthermore, in the \"About Visual Studio\" pop-up I don't see listed Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio. My fear is that the Oracle Developer Tools aren't working somehow, but the Oracle Universal Installer said everything was correctly installed (and I rebooted several times).</li>\n<li>What is  the best practise to achieve this requirement?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Long version</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, we created the Entity Data Model from a SQL Server database. So far so good.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we installed ODAC 11.2 Release 4 and Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio (11.2.0.3.0) from <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/utilsoft-086879.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/utilsoft-086879.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I have managed to initialize our model, <code>SIAEntities</code> (which inherites from  <code>ObjectContext</code>), with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            System.Data.EntityClient.EntityConnectionStringBuilder builder = new System.Data.EntityClient.EntityConnectionStringBuilder();\n        builder.Metadata = \"res://*/SIA.Models.SIAModelOracle.ssdl|res://*/Models.SIAModel.csdl|res://*/Models.SIAModel.msl\";\n        builder.ProviderConnectionString = \"data source=***;persist security info=True;user id=***;password=***\";\n        builder.Provider = \"Oracle.DataAccess.Client\"; \n        SIAEntities db2 = new SIAEntities(builder.ConnectionString);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>SIA.Models.SIAModelOracle.ssdl</code> is a custom written file (embedded resource) which overrides the SSDL part of the .edmx and has the following modifications:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>Provider</code> attribute of the root <code>Schema</code> node set to <code>Oracle.DataAccess.Client</code></li>\n<li>All data type names converted to their Oracle equivalent (datetime > date, nvarchar > varchar2, image > blob, etc)</li>\n<li>An <code>oracle.dataaccess.client</code> node added in the <code>web.config</code> which maps <code>bool</code> to <code>number(1,0)</code> and <code>tinyint</code> to <code>number(3,0)</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The error arrived when executing the first query (a simple <code>SELECT</code>): I tracked it as being due to the double quotes in the query that gets executed against the db, forcing it to be case-sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>By manually editing the custom .ssdl file and uppercasing everything I can let EF \"see\" the table and recognize a column after the other, but I didn't push this solution too far (thus stopping before getting to read the whole table) because a) it didn't seem too clean b) I have difficulties understanding the links between the .ssdl and the .csdl/.msl parts so I wasn't sure where to uppercase and where not to!</p>\n\n<p>Another strategy I was contemplating to avoid this manual work could be to try and generate a separate model from the Oracle schema and wrap the two <code>ObjectContext</code>s with another class that handles the choice between either of them, but as question #2 says, I cannot do that. </p>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","entity-framework"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":12557988,"title":"Recommended strategy for fetching data asynchornously","body":"<p>Lets say that I need to executed several different queries to database.

The Purchase table has a PurchaseId, UserId, and SalespersonId.  But once you add the SalespersonUser nav property back in (stop ignoring it), you end up with two more keys in the table: User_UserId and SalespersonUser_UserId (as well as the original UserId and SalespersonUserId).</p>\n\n<p>Also, the SQL generated definitely shows where the problem arises.</p>\n\n<p>Without the nav property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{SELECT \n[Extent1].[PurchaseId] AS [PurchaseId], \n[Extent1].[UserId] AS [UserId], \n[Extent1].[SalespersonUserId] AS [SalespersonUserId], \n[Extent2].[UserId] AS [UserId1], \n[Extent2].[UserName] AS [UserName]\nFROM  [Purchases] AS [Extent1]\nINNER JOIN [Users] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[UserId] = [Extent2].[UserId]}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and with the nav property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{SELECT \n[Extent1].[PurchaseId] AS [PurchaseId], \n[Extent1].[UserId] AS [UserId], \n[Extent1].[SalespersonUserId] AS [SalespersonUserId], \n[Extent2].[UserId] AS [UserId1], \n[Extent2].[UserName] AS [UserName], \n[Extent1].[SalespersonUser_UserId] AS [SalespersonUser_UserId]\nFROM  [Purchases] AS [Extent1]\nLEFT OUTER JOIN [Users] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[User_UserId] = [Extent2].[UserId]}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how it pulls the UserId, but joins with the User_UserId, and a left join, no less.  The SalespersonUserId isn't even referenced in a join.  Inside the database after writing the record, the UserId is set, but the User_UserID is null.  Thus, nothing to join, and we get null for the Included User.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem to me that this is a bug in EF, but it is possible there is a design reason for it.  If so, can someone clear it up for me, and perhaps describe some fluent API that may work around it?

The back end uses Repository and UnitofWork Pattern and Unity on top of Entity Framework with the entities class generated from the edmx. I won't go into a whole lot of detail as its not necessary but basically there are 5 steps that the workflow goes through. A particular process might be at any stage at any point in time (in order of course). Step one just generates data for step two, which validates the data via a long running process to another server. Then step there generates a pdf with that data. For each stage we spawn a timer, however it is configurable to allow more than one timer to be spawned for each stage. Therein lays the problem. When I add a processor to a particular stage, it the following error randomly:</p>\n\n<p>The connection was not closed.

My design is as follows - Silverlight client calls a service agent(this is just a wrapper to a in process WCF service) through normal synchronous method call.  THe service agent inturn calls a WCF service which is configured with a custombinding with binary encoding and httptransport. This WCF service is hoested in the same application as Silverlight and the calls from service agent is being made through \"operationame\"Async methods. Theservice agent has custom events that will be fired when \"operation\"Completed method is called. This service agent event will be handled by silverlight. This WCF service again makes a call to a distributed WCF service using \"operationame\"Async method.</p>\n\n<p>My silverlight application has four different widgets in the screen and they make four calls to the service agent. The four calls from the service agent are being triggered parallely to the in process WCF service. But from the in process WCF service the calls are being made sequentially to the ditributed wcf service. I just checked with fiddler which shows that in process wcf is making sequential calls to ditributed wcf service. I would like to make it in parallel. Can somebody please help. The problem is my server is processing them ony by one as against running them in parallel. I confirmed this through fiddler where i saw the calls were arriving at the WCF sequentially. The WCF distributed service is configured as a percall with concurrencymode single and webhttpbinding.</p>\n\n<p>Also does anybody have any resource/links to understand how the silverlight / wcf threading model works.

We are already using compiled queries at most places and we have implemented pre-compiled views for EF. The size of the model and application is very large and complex. Warm up needs to walk through many pages to ensure that compiled and non-compiled EF queries get executed at-least once before any end user gets access to the application.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework","ef-code-first"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":0,"question_id":12525482,"title":"Entity Framework, strange behaviour with required reference, lazy loading","body":"<p>This goes for both Entity Framework 4 (4.3.1) and 5.</p>\n\n<p>I have a User class (to go with my Entity Framework MembershipProvider).

An issue I've been thinking on is that some objects can become really quite large over time. They can have lots of properties that map back to columns in the database. With these objects it would be rare to ever update more than one or two fields at a time so it begs the question, why require all the fields to do the full trip back from client to server to database.</p>\n\n<p>Some JavaScript frameworks provide the option as to whether to send all fields or just changed ones back to the server so client side is clean and simple.</p>\n\n<p>Server side is a little bit more of a challenge from what I see. The serializer will step in and try to map some json or xml to a type. JSON.NET for example handles missing values well provided the corresponding properties in the object are nullable.</p>\n\n<p>Reattaching the deserialized model back to entity framework on the other hand is where things get tricky. The default WebApi template for a controller does it in one line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>db.Entry(user).State = EntityState.Modified;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This obviously sets the whole object to modified. It's of course possible to set individual properties to modified rather than the whole object and I would assume this means EF is a little more clever and only sends the modified properties back in the SQL UPDATE.</p>\n\n<p>So the problem here is, how do I know what properties are updated? I only get a object back in my controller method so I cant ask the serializer what properties it pulled in (even if that was possible for a given serializer).\nIf I have a list of properties then I could set current values with their state to modified in EF and hopefully that should result in my clean db query.</p>\n\n<p>The other perhaps more obvious option is to first retrieve the object I want to update from a database, and modify only the changed properties one by one on the retrieved object or if EF has support for it, perhaps I can pass it the unattached object and have it do this itself. This isn't as desirable an option as it does mean a whole database read where the whole point of the exercise is efficiency. What we would be doing is trading the clients http efficiency and bandwidth for hit on server to db efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>So to me it seems if I want to do this on the server, I'm between a rock and a hard place. WebApi and EF do most of the work, but at the cost of flexibility. I'm looking for options or angles that I haven't mentioned in hope of a simple solution that doesn't throw away one of these two great technologies.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","sql","json","asp.net-mvc-3","entity-framework"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12516890,"title":"ASP.NET MVC JSON Entity Framework - Saving data","body":"<p>I have an asp.net MVC3 application, trying to save data to MS SQL table (Entity Framework).<br>\nHere is the table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CasesProgress\n    {\n        public virtual long ID { get; set; }\n        public virtual long Learner_ID { get; set; }\n        public virtual long Course_ID { get; set; }\n        public virtual long StudyCase_ID { get; set; }\n        public virtual long CaseList_ID { get; set; }\n        public virtual bool Viewed { get; set; }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ActionResult StoreProgress(long Learner_ID, long Course_ID, long StudyCase_ID, long CaseList_ID)\n    {\n        CasesProgress casesprogress = new CasesProgress();\n        casesprogress.Learner_ID = Learner_ID;\n        casesprogress.Course_ID = Course_ID;\n        casesprogress.StudyCase_ID = StudyCase_ID;\n        casesprogress.CaseList_ID = CaseList_ID;\n        casesprogress.Viewed = true;\n        db.CasesProgresses.AddObject(casesprogress);\n        db.SaveChanges();\n        return Json(new { success = true });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and here is my Javascript:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   function StoreProgress1() {\n        $.ajax({\n            url: '/Home/StoreProgress',\n            type: 'POST',\n            data: {\n                LearnerID: \"211\",\n                Course_ID: \"6\",\n                StudyCase_ID: \"19\",\n                CaseList_ID: \"2\"\n            },\n            contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',\n            success: function (data) {\n                alert(data.success);\n            },\n            error: function () {\n                alert(\"error\");\n            }\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get error message without even going to the breakpoint I have in the controller.

Unfortunately this doesn't appear to extend to the same sort of thing when creating a nested object where I'm not flattening.</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","tsql","ef-code-first"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":178,"score":1,"question_id":10710277,"title":"Transaction deadlocked on lock resources when using EF code first","body":"<p>I am using EF code first.

In this instance, should I use a DependencyProperty or INotifyPropertyChanged?

So is there a way to include the POCO objects in tfs so we don't have to generate them when a new dev opens the solution?  </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n\n<p>So I tried what a few people have suggested and use \"include in project\" but if I look at the the folder that contains the model in visual studio with the show all files options on none of the classes show up.  BUT if I look at the folder with windows explorer it shows all the files... what give?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc","entity-framework","oop"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":0,"question_id":12429913,"title":"Is it possible to map an entity to the result of a stored procedure in Entity Framework?","body":"<p>I'm attempting to setup Entity Framework using Code First on an existing database.

Do you think there is a mapping strategy that can make this work?</p>\n\n<p>So I have a base abstract class called “Animal” and 3 derived classes from the Animal class, Fish, Dog, and UnknownAnimal.  Animal class has a SQL table of its own, Fish and Dog has SQL table Fish and Dog respectively.  UnknownAnimal does not have any extra fields so there is no need a SQL table for this class.  To make it a bit easier, Animal SQL Table has a discriminator column (TypeName) to determine the Animal type.</p>\n\n<p>The codes and a picture of the SQL tables is below.  It is neither TPH or TPT but a mixture.  The only solution I see is to make it TPT, by creating a SQL table “UnknownAnimal” and point UnknownAnimal Class to use this table.  But I do not want to approach this way since UnknownAnimal does not have any extra property and is taking up space in the SQL server (not much).  </p>\n\n<p>Code for full test project with integration Nunit test and even database .bak file.\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/RomeoQNgo/efinheritancetest/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitbucket.org/RomeoQNgo/efinheritancetest/downloads</a></p>\n\n<p>I tried TPT but that required an extra UnknownAnimal SQL table.  That mean if I have another class like UnknownAnimal (inherit from Animal but has no extra property) then I have to create a new table for it.  One easy approach would be have a discriminator field called something like TypeName in the Animal SQL Table and let that determine class type.  But then I don’t want to use TPH because if there are more animal type with new property unique for that animal (like elephant with property like TrunkLength) then we have to create a new column in the Animals SQL table which I don’t want to go this path unless there are no possible way.</p>\n\n<p>So I want to combine both TPH and TPT which use discriminator field (TypeName) to determine class type and extra table for the animal’s extra properties unique for that class.  I want to use Code First and do not want to use any EDMX file for this.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if there are any good approach for this currently with EF Code First.

Database-First was appealing because of the control; however, it does does not have the out-of-the-box change management functionality Code-First Migrations provides.  Thus, Code-First Migrations seemed to be a winner because [code-first] model-driven changes are automatic and it meant there would be only one thing to maintain.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","entity-framework","unit-testing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":2,"question_id":12424379,"title":"Create a fake DbContext","body":"<p>I am creating an MVC application with EF and currently have used the generic repository pattern, like this one: <a href=\"http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/generic-repository-pattern-entity-framework-asp-net-mvc-and-unit-testing-triangle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Generic Repository Pattern</a>.
