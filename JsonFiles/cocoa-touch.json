Obviously, one solution is I just import those 4 unnecessary files into Lite build phase, and just use the whole class (even the parts it doesn't need). This seems inefficient though. I know I can do an ifndef to block those files from being imported if the Lite version is running, but how do I block out the code in the class from also not being picked up by the compiler? </p>\n\n<p>Would a better way just be to have my Lite version create a subclass of the Base class that only uses the options it needs? But then I believe, would I still need to import those unnecessary files?</p>\n\n<p>Just a bit confused about this, first time I've ever created another target that utilizes code from the main target.

Any improvements that could be made here?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> I replaced the default back button with the following in the viewDidLoad of the pushed view</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Set the custom back button\nUIImage *buttonImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"back.png\"];\n\n//create the button and assign the image\nUIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];\n[button setImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\n\n//set the frame of the button to the size of the image (see note below)\nbutton.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, buttonImage.size.width, buttonImage.size.height);\n\n[button addTarget:self action:@selector(back) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];\n\n// offset the back button\nbutton.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 5, -10, -5);\n\n//create a UIBarButtonItem with the button as a custom view\nUIBarButtonItem *customBarItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:button];\nself.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = customBarItem;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not very pleased with this solution because it leaves customization of the bar to the controller on top of the navigation stack. <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UINavigationController_Class/Reference/Reference.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">From the Apple docs</a> it would seem like they'd prefer you to subclass the UINavigationBar altogether and replace it once and for all in the navigation controller: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can also specify a custom UINavigationBar subclass by using the initWithNavigationBarClass:toolbarClass: method to initialize the navigation controller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Would that be the advised route? I was NOT able to replace the default Back button of the UINavigationBar through [UIBarButtonItem appearance] as it still attempts to display text in the button, and when you remove the text, the button isn't displayed at all. Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> The page title should be replaceable with another view through navigationItem.titleView. Anything better out there?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","cocoa-touch","self"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":363,"score":1,"question_id":1311507,"title":"what is self? when should i use it?","body":"<p>can you explain me the <strong>self</strong> in the objective-C 2.0 ? when and where should i use?\nis it similar with this definition in java?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","cocoa-touch","uitextfield"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":297,"score":0,"question_id":5617153,"title":"How to get textfield values","body":"<p>I created a UI by parsing XML (I haven't used a xib file).

Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSString *const kFileName = @\"PCFData.bin\";\n//these are all my static variables..I have to initialize them to something so\n//they can be used in other parts of my program with the keyword extern.\nNSString *finalTermValue = @\"\";\nNSString *finalClassValue = @\"\";\nNSString *finalTermDescription = @\"\";\nNSMutableArray *savedResults = nil;\n\n@implementation PCFAppDelegate\n\n@synthesize finalTermValue, finalClassValue, finalTermDescription, savedResults;\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n    // Override point for customization after application launch.\n    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);\n    NSString *docDir = [paths objectAtIndex:0];\n    NSString *fullPath = [docDir stringByAppendingFormat:@\"/%@\", kFileName];\n    BOOL fileExists = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:fullPath];\n    if (fileExists) {\n        savedResults = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFile:fullPath];\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\n- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application\n{\n    // Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.

I've been banging by head against the wall the last few days after recent unexplained errors that strangely coincided with an X-Code update to ver. 4.5.2. I couldn't find any similar issues anywhere on Google or Stackoveflow.</p>\n\n<p>The shift rotations are set and saved by the user. The process of creating a shift rotation involves presenting a user with a range of dates, and the user associating each date with a particular shift.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Core Data with a sqlite store to manage the saved data. The object graph for the above elements involve  several \"Shift\" NSManagedObject entities which contain the details of a shift, such as title, start and end times, and most importantly a date which allows the shift rotation to be displayed later. The \"Shift\" entities are kept together by another NSManagedObject called \"ShiftRotation\" which has a many-to-one relationship to the \"Shifts\".</p>\n\n<p>My app was working properly until recently, when I made few changes to how I was using these \"Shift\" objects.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is this. The user associates a \"Shift\" to a date. The date is stored inside a \"date\" property within the \"Shift\" NSManagedObject. The context is saved. When I access the \"Shift\" later, without making any changes, the date that was assigned to the \"Shift\" appears changed.</p>\n\n<p>I went through my code line by line and added numerous NSLogs to see where or why it's changing, with no results. I noticed that there is no change to the date immediately before AND after I save the context within the class where the save is occurring. There's also no change when I access it from the main Calendar screen. However when I later retrieve the \"Shifts\" from another screen where I manage all shift rotations, they appear to have changed.</p>\n\n<p>The date change is approximately 31 to 32 days in the future. I can't help but wonder if this is a bug in Core Data or I'm a missing something.</p>\n\n<p>Any explanation or reason why accessing a date from a sqlite persistent store causes a significant and unpredictable date change?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried to further narrow down what was happening and where it was happening by using NSNotificationCenter.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using iOS 6.</p>\n\n<p>I registered the root view controller to observe any changes to the managed object context.

It seems that I was inadvertently changing the \"date\" property after I was saving the context somewhere else in my code. Perhaps that would have not happened if I had followed carmin's convention (I would have given +1 if I had the reputation). The value was not changing in the Persistent store after all.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps sharing how I tracked down this bug might benefit anyone else that might have similar problems, not necessarily related to Core Data. </p>\n\n<p>I used Key Value Observing, to observe the \"date\" property. I began observing immediately after creating the \"Shift\" entity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity addObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and stopped observing after a point in my code where the change had already occurred:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[_shiftEntity removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"date\" context:NULL];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then implemented the KVO method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Object being observed: %@\", [object description]);\n    NSLog(@\"Value changed to: %@\", change[NSKeyValueChangeNewKey]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed a break point at the above method. When the change occurred, it stopped at this point, and told me what had change. Most importantly, when the code stopped executing, I looked at the call stack, and traced my way back through the path that the code took that caused the change. I was able to find exactly where my code was making the change.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have much knowledge using KVO but this experience showed me its usefulness even for debugging purposes.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","cocoa-touch","uiview","uikit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13213542,"title":"Which component is used by lookbook.nu app?","body":"<p>I'm searching the way to do this: \n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8fv6z.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>How can I do it?

With the design I have to implement, I cannot just use the default navigation bar</li>\n<li>works well with the UINavigationController; when the user taps the \"back\" button, the main view controller (with the button bar) should stay, but the child view controller representing the actual scene content should go back to the previous scene.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem currently is that the \"back\" button won't change the child controller--it changes the parent controller, returning to the previous scene before the scene with the button bars. I've tried this several different ways. I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right, or if it can't be done.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is to implement my own \"back\" functionality, keeping a stack of child view controllers and manually changing them when the user taps \"back.\" This is awkward, however, and poor design compared to using UINavigationController.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I am going the wrong way with this. I can't accept duplicating the button bar across every single scene in Interface Builder... but perhaps I should create it programmatically, and then I can easily call that code from each and every scene. Then I would have \"normal\" view controllers, and using UINavigationController would be easier. But before I go that route and completely scrap what I have so far, I wanted to see if there was another way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an overview of some parts of my solution:</p>\n\n<p>I created a ButtonBarController, laying out the Storyboard with a UIView for the buttons I wanted, and a UIView for the content pane. I also layered a button with the app logo (to go to the app's main screen) on top of a back button.</p>\n\n<p>Then I created a controller for each of those other screens. In those subscreens/child view controllers, I would first add a UIView at the correct size to fit in my content pane, and then would add all the other controls I wanted. I had all of those child view controllers inherit from another controller, which took care of a few common tasks--such as procuring a reference to the button bar controller, and code to help resize the views for 3.5\" versus 4\" screens.</p>\n\n<p>I created a changeToControllerWithIndex method; I call this when the app loads, when the user clicks one of the buttons in the main button bar to change scenes, or when anything happens in a scene requiring another scene change. I overload this method to provide two additional pieces of information: providing an NSDictionary with any extra information the child view controller needs, and to tell it whether this is a top-level scene, or whether we need a back button.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: it's important to set the Storyboard ID for those child view controllers in the Identity Inspector. I kept accidentally setting the Title in the Attribute Inspector instead)</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    [self changeToControllerWithIndex:index withPayload:nil isRootView:YES];\n}\n\n// This is the method that will change the active view controller and the view that is shown\n- (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload isRootView:(BOOL)isRootView\n{\n    if (YES) {\n        self.index = index;\n\n        // The code below will properly remove the the child view controller that is\n        // currently being shown to the user and insert the new child view controller.\n        UIViewController *vc = [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:payload];\n\n        if (isRootView) {\n            NSLog(@\"putting navigation controller in\");\n            childNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n            [childNavigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];\n            [self addChildViewController:childNavigationController];\n            [childNavigationController didMoveToParentViewController:self];\n\n            if (self.currentViewController){\n                [self.currentViewController willMoveToParentViewController:nil];\n\n                [self transitionFromViewController:self.currentViewController toViewController:childNavigationController duration:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^{\n                    [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];\n                } completion:^(BOOL finished) {\n                    [self.currentViewController removeFromParentViewController];\n                    self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n                }];\n            } else {\n                [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n                self.currentViewController = childNavigationController;\n            }\n\n            [self.currentView addSubview:childNavigationController.view];\n\n            //We are at the root of the navigation path, so no back button for us\n            [homeButton setHidden:NO];\n            [backButton setHidden:YES];\n        } else {\n            //Not a root view -- we're in navigation and want a back button\n\n            [childNavigationController pushViewController:vc animated:NO];\n\n            [homeButton setHidden:YES];\n            [backButton setHidden:NO];\n        }\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have an overloaded method to set up each individual view controller... some require a little more preparation than others.</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index {\n    return [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index withPayload:nil];\n}\n\n// This is where you instantiate each child controller and setup anything you need  on them, like delegates and public properties.\n- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index withPayload:(id)payload {\n    UIViewController *vc = nil;\n    if (index == CONTROLLER_HOME){\n        vc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Home\"];\n    } else if (index == CONTROLLER_CATEGORIES){\n        SAVECategoryViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"Categories\"];\n        if (payload) {\n            child.currentCategory = [(NSNumber *) [(NSDictionary *)payload objectForKey:ATTRIBUTE_CAT_ID] integerValue];\n        } else {\n            child.currentCategory = CATEGORY_ALL;\n        }\n        vc = child;\n    } //etc for all the other controllers...\n    payload = nil;\n\n    return vc;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I mentioned my difficulty with managing the \"back\" navigation.

When the app is attached and running in the debugger, there is no debug output to say why like with a 'normal' crash. I know it happens after a LoadView  because an NSLog at the end of LoadView is the last output, on the <strong>same</strong> screen every time. Below is the limited crash report form Organizer ('unknown' process I think because it was running in the debugger?)  This has only started happening on ios6. There are apparently no memory leaks according to the instrument though I'm not sure I entirely trust it. The crash tends to happen when you play the game for a while and go back and forth through the screens so it feels like a leak. However the fact it is always when returning to the same screen suggests it's a problem with that view controller.

It works great on simulator.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Wow, I removed the override of scrollViewDidScroll and somehow refresh xib file. I was downloading the project from git repository, and in case I open xib file, XCode notifies that changes are made. I usually do cmd+z and save, but this time I saved without cmd+z and it is working right now! Diff states that opening xib file results in changes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;object class=\"IBActionInfo\" key=\"onTotal:\"&gt;\n    &lt;string key=\"name\"&gt;onTotal:&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;string key=\"candidateClassName\"&gt;id&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and few other like that and: UIControl</p>\n\n<p>and finally\n    &lt; string key=\"IBCocoaTouchPluginVersion\">1926&lt; /string></p>\n\n<p>It's some kind of magic to me! I try it on iPad with iOS 5.1.1, 6.0 and iPhone with iOS 6.0 and it works perfectly fine, but unfortunately it does not work on iPad with iOS 4.3.5. The issue is that after scrollToRowAtIndexPath: no scrolling occurs mostly or it jams.

This creates a bunch of usability issues, as the larger iPad store assumes that it has a much larger area to display it's content that it actually has (off screen buttons, lists that scroll in 20px height, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a flag or any way we can work around this behavior? We are eventually planning on a native iPad UI, but our client would like to demo/release the iPhone app for the first phase.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","xcode","cocoa-touch","xcode-storyboard"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":11205,"score":12,"question_id":8513319,"title":"Closing a view displayed via a modal segue in Xcode","body":"<p>I'm manually invoking a segue (set as modal) in order to display a login form in Xcode 4.2 using Storyboards with the following line of code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[self performSegueWithIdentifier:@\"LoginSegue\" sender:nil];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm probably missing something really simple, however I can't find a way to programmatically close the login view and return to the previous view.</p>\n\n<p>The view is part of a navigation view controller, so setting the segue type to \"push\" allows me to use the back button to send me back to my previous screen, but in \"modal\" mode, I'm not entirely sure how to achieve this (after button press, for example)</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","ios","performance","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":2,"question_id":12990722,"title":"How do I test the load time of my application?","body":"<p>I would like to benchmark the load time of my application but am not sure how to do this.

I often need the recipe's items in a specific order, so I added some methods to <code>Recipe</code> - <code>itemsByName</code>, <code>itemsByDate</code>, etc. These use a <code>sortDescriptor</code> to sort everything in the <code>items</code> set and return an <code>NSArray</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Accessing <code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors</code> during runtime was proving to be a noticeable bottleneck in my UI, so I added a caching mechanism. <code>Recipe</code> now has an iVar for each sorted array: <code>_cachedItemsByName</code>, <code>_cachedItemsByDate</code>, etc. If the cache exists (and is not flagged as dirty), the <code>itemsByName</code> method returns the iVar instead of re-sorting the set each time.</p>\n\n<p>This worked fine once my application had been running a while, but still lead to noticeable UI issues each time a recipe's ordered items was requested for the first time (since the cache had to be created using <code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors</code>). So, I decided that when the application launches, it should update the cache for all of my recipes immediately - sacrificing load time for a better in-app experience. This has worked very well and my UI issues are now resolved.</p>\n\n<p>However, I would really like to chip away at that initial load time. But I'm not sure where to turn. I have considered the following options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On launch, update all of the caches in a background thread. After a few hours of research into GCD this seems like a non-starter. I've read that I can't interact with the NSManagedObjectContext or any of it's objects in a different thread (my processing just involves iterating through each <code>Recipe</code> object and telling it to update it's iVar. This involves sorting through it's <code>items</code> relationship).</li>\n<li>Just make <code>items</code> an ordered relationship so that the order doesn't have to be calculated at run time. But I have multiple orders in which I need to return the items, so I would need multiple relationships to the same objects, just in different orders. This seems icky - I would be responsible for keeping each <code>NSOrderedSet</code> up to date. For example, when an item is added, I would have to insert it multiple times into different relationships. Also, I have read that the NSOrderedSet introduces it's own performance overhead.</li>\n<li>Some other way to persist the cache - I don't really know where to start on this one. Perhaps write each Recipe's cache to file somehow, and then try to match them up at load time? I'm not sure this would be any quicker than re-sorting each recipe on launch, but I would be willing to try it out if someone could suggest how and where to store this.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would love some feedback on each of the options above, and even better, some alternatives. I am pleased with my solution for improving in-app performance, but would really like to speed up my initial launch.</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","cocoa-touch","uiview","uilabel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13014112,"title":"How to make UIView like UILabel to scretch and shrink depending on the amount of texts or content in it?","body":"<p>If we put too much text, <code>UILabel</code> would shrink the texts.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we put 4 lines in a text.

It just adds the same view over and over which will create a bug in the Application. The code I have doesn't really help explain I don't think but I'll post it just incase it <strong><em>does</em></strong> help. I should mention that the integer value changes whenever the server I'm pulling the value from is edited:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int numObjectives;\n    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@/api/groups/get/1\",URL_ROOT]];\n\n    NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];\n\n        NSError *error = nil;\n        NSDictionary *result = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:NSJSONReadingMutableContainers error:&amp;error];\n        if (error == nil) {\n            NSLog(@\"%@\", result);\n// Collecting data from server and logging the results to make sure it's working.\n\n            NSDictionary *user_results = [result objectForKey:@\"results\"];\n            NSString *name = [user_results objectForKey:@\"name\"];\n//n_obj is the number of objectives displayed on the server\n            NSString *n_obj = [user_results objectForKey:@\"n_objectives\"];\n            NSLog(@\"%@\", n_obj);\n//numObjectives is my int which is equal to whatever the String n_obj is on the server.\n            numObjectives = [ n_obj integerValue];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So Now I've posted some code I'll just summarise what I want to do. I want my <code>UIView</code> to be added the same number of times that the <code>numObjectives</code> value is. I assume the best way to do this is to create an array for the <code>UIView</code> that way it's not just continually adding the <code>UIView</code> over and over which isn't an Xcode friendly way to do it. Hopefully the code I've posted helps make sense of what I'm trying to do. Sorry if i've not explained this very well I will be happy to elaborate if need be.

I just uploaded my first app to the App Store for the first time, and of course, now my app is exploding left and right.

The only thing that was different about that type of operation was the value I returned from an accessory method. The accessory method generally returned <code>NSDecimalNumber</code>s with values of 0-3, but there was one special case when I was returning an <code>NSDecimalNumber</code> with a non-integer value. I would test the result of the accessory method looking for the non-integer value. I changed the special case to return an <code>NSDecimalNumber</code> with a value of -1 instead of the non-integer value, and I can no longer make the app crash.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the only change I made was switching from\n<code>[[NSNumber numberWithDouble:num] decimalValue]</code> --> crash\nto\n<code>[[NSNumber numberWithInteger:num] decimalValue]</code> --> no crash</p>\n\n<p>It's a little but more complicated than that, but not much.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm happy that the app no longer crashes but the change I made does not fill me with confidence, as the old bits of code did not appear to be \"broken\" in any way.

The <strong>very moment</strong> I re-introduce the UINavigationController into the mix, no matter if it is added as a subview before or after the table view, and no matter if alloc/init it before or after the table view is added as a subview, the result is the same as it was before.</p>\n\n<p>I'm beginning to suspect UINavigationController isn't much of a team player...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong> The suggestion to check frame size after the table view on screen was a good one: turns out that the navigation controller is in fact resizing it some time in between load and display.

The correct number of UIBarButtonItems appear on the toolbar, but their titles are blank.

Note that the curves are mapping input time to output time (T-t curve) and not time-position curves. For instance, <em>easeOutBounce(T) = t</em> returns a new <em>t</em>. Then that <em>t</em> is used to plot the movement (or whatever property we should animate).</p>\n\n<p><em>So, I'd like to create a complex custom <code>CAMediaTimingFunction</code> but I have no clue how to do that, or if it's even possible? Are there any alternatives?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is a concrete example in to steps. Very educational :)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I want to animate an object along a line from point <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>, but I want it to \"bounce\" its movement along the line using the easeOutBounce curve above. This means it will follow the exact line from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>, but will accelerate and decelerate in a more complex way than what is possible using the current bezier-based CAMediaTimingFunction. </p></li>\n<li><p>Lets make that line any arbitrary curve movement specified with CGPath. It should still move along that curve, but it should accelerate and decelerate the same way as in the line example.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In theory I think it should work like this:</p>\n\n<p>Lets describe the movement curve as a keyframe animation <em>move(t) = p</em>, where <em>t</em> is time [0..1], <em>p</em> is position calculated at time <em>t</em>. So <em>move(0)</em> returns the position at the start of curve, <em>move(0.5)</em> the exact middle and <em>move(1)</em> at end. Using a an timing function <em>time(T) = t</em> to provide the <em>t</em> values for <em>move</em> should give me what I want. For a bouncing effect, the timing function should return the same <em>t</em> values for <em>time(0.8)</em> and <em>time(0.8)</em> (just an example). Just replace the timing function to get a different effect.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, it's possible to do line-bouncing by creating and joining four line segments which goes back and forth, but that shouldn't be necessary. After all, it's just a simple linear function which maps <em>time</em> values to positions.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope I'm making sense here.</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3921,"score":6,"question_id":3585470,"title":"How to Read Number of lines in UITextView","body":"<p>I am using UITextView In my View , i have requirement to count number of line contained by textview am using following function to read '\\n' .

Here's how it looks:</p>\n\n<p>I have a Tabbar Controller which displays a Navigation Controller. Another view controller that is being presented by the Navigation Controller displays a Modal View Controller.</p>\n\n<p>TabbarController --> NavigationController --> ViewController (presenting) --\n                                                              | shows using modal segue |\n                                                              --> ViewController (presented)</p>\n\n<p>Steps to cause the crash:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Access the View Controller (presenting) in hierarchy shown above. It is not root view cntrl but higher.</li>\n<li>Trigger the segue to the modal view controller.</li>\n<li>Pick a tab from the tab bar (whichever) and go back to the same View Controller (presenting). Picking a tab calls popToRoot on the Navigation Controller.</li>\n<li>Again trigger the modal segue to the View Controller (presented)</li>\n<li>Crash: Zombie object - View Controller (presented) - got messaged</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why?\nIt looks like on previous iOS when popToRoot was called and View Controller (presenting) was being cleaned up also the modal view was destroyed. So when it was accessed again it was recreated and presented.\nOn iOS 6 from what Allocations Instrumentation shows the modal view is destroyed together with \nView Controller (presenting). But when it's being accessed for some reason UIKit creates a new modav view controller but then messages the old one that is not existent anymore. Doesn't make sense.</p>\n\n<p>One other thing that makes me wonder is that on iOS 5 Allocations Instrumentation tool never shows me the View Controller (presented) with retain count = 0 but iOS 6 does (afterwards it makes it -1).</p>\n\n<p>I know this is probably very difficult question to help me with but maybe someone was already tackling problems with iOS 6 and such segues?</p>\n\n<p>From Allocations Instrumentation tool I can tell that many things got changed in the implementation of segues on iOS 6.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","cocoa-touch","user-interface","uitextfield"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":92,"score":2,"question_id":11285502,"title":"A static character prefix in UITextField","body":"<p>Is there a built-in way to add a character prefix to a <code>UITextField</code> like the screenshot below?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/I52KA.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>If no, what is the best, most straight-forward way to accomplish this?

Maybe LLDB is still too new, but I'm getting a lot of debugger crashes / deadlocks and even when that doesn't happen it does't seem to work like I expected.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to put together a debug wrapper around all selector calls, to extract the message call graph inside a certain chunk of code. (I could explain why if you really want to know, but it isn't really relevant to the debugger issue.)</p>\n\n<p>I start out with an Xcode breakpoint on the line where I want to start tracking things (for bonus points, this is happening on a secondary thread, but before you ask, no, nothing on any other thread is doing any accesses to this object or anything in its property subgraph):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[myObject startProcessing];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The breakpoint triggers, and I run \"bt\", just to extract:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* thread #5: tid = 0x2203, 0x000277d2 .........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then do something mildly evil: I put a breakpoint in objc_msgSend, right at the instruction where it calls out to the real object selector. objc_msgSend looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libobjc.A.dylib`objc_msgSend:\n...(instructions)...\n0x37babfa4:  bx     r12\n...(more instructions)...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Actually there are two bx calls but let's keep things simple.) I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint set -a 0x37babfa4 -t 0x2203\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(TID included because I'm having enough trouble tracking this one thread and I don't need irrelevant stuff interfering.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's where the scripting comes in. The setup described above works exactly as I'd like it to. If I resume execution until the breakpoint triggers, I can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>frame select 0\nthread step-inst -m this-thread 5\nframe info\ncontinue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the effect will be that the debugger:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>moves to the objc_msgSend frame</li>\n<li>steps by one instruction, advancing it into the object selector frame it was pointing at</li>\n<li>displays relevant details (object type, selector called)</li>\n<li>resumes execution</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>at which point I can keep pasting in those four commands over and over and copying the output until I hate myself.</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s command\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and paste in those <em>exact same commands</em>, everything breaks. It does not advance to the object selector frame. It doesn't show the frame details, or at least not the correct ones -- depending on various tweaks (see below), it may or may not show \"objc_msgSend\" as being the current function. It doesn't resume execution.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, if I could get that example working, I'd be mostly happy. But for even more bonus points, I've also tried this with python, which I would prefer because it would allow for much more sophisticated logging:</p>\n\n<pre><code>breakpoint command add -s python\n&gt; thread = frame.GetThread()\n&gt; thread.StepInstruction(1)\n&gt; newFrame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(0)\n&gt; print \" \" * thread.GetNumFrames() + newFrame.GetFunctionName()\n&gt; process = thread.GetProcess()\n&gt; process.Continue()\n&gt; DONE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again no good. Again depending on tiny details, this may or may not print <em>something</em> (usually objc_msgSend), but it never prints the correct thing. It never steps the instruction forward. It never resumes execution afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>And again, the python version works fine if I do it by hand: if I wait till the breakpoint fires, then run \"script\" and enter those exact same lines, it works as expected. Some parts will even work in isolation, e.g. if I remove everything except the parts that get the process and call process.Continue() and trigger those automatically, that \"works\" (meaning I see the lldb prompt flashing rapidly as it suspends and resumes execution. Usually I regret this because it becomes unresponsive and crashes shortly after.)</p>\n\n<p>So: Any ideas? Is the technology Not Ready Yet, or am I just missing some clever piece of the puzzle that will fix everything? Or should I give up entirely and just live with the fact that there are some parts of object internals that I will never understand?...</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","cocoa-touch","debugging","gdb","lldb"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":435,"score":2,"question_id":10427496,"title":"Unable to set a watchpoint in either gdb or lldb","body":"<p>I am trying to set a watchpoint while debugging my app on the device.

So I'm using separate threads for touch events and timer.</p>\n\n<p>When I use <code>[NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:0.01]</code> it makes all threads sleep. I mean touch events are also stop to come through. I want to stop the timer thread only.</p>\n\n<p>This is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event\n{\n    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\n\n    BOOL Done = NO;\n    while (!Done)\n    {\n        NSAutoreleasePool *loopPool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\n        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:0.01];\n        [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(callTapCode) withObject:tapView waitUntilDone:YES];\n\n        //performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(callTapCode) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:YES];\n\n        [loopPool release];\n        Done=YES;\n    }\n\n    [pool drain];\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","objective-c","cocoa","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1054,"score":3,"question_id":490148,"title":"How can I use OCMock objects with code that calls isKindOfClass?","body":"<p>I'd like to test some code with OCMock. </p>\n\n<p>The innards of the code are calling <code>[NSObject isKindOfClass]</code> on the mock object I'm providing to the code, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if ([object isKindOfClass:[FancyClass class]]) { ...}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I provide an OCMockObject-based mock created like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mock = [OCMockObject mockForClass:[FancyClass class]];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it appears that it does not pass the <code>isKindOfClass</code> test.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["iphone","ios","xcode","arrays","cocoa-touch"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":12883853,"title":"Reset array after playing the game?","body":"<p>I made a quiz in iOS with xcode, what i have now is a quiz that generates 20 random answers out of an array, it controls the text of the labels when a button is pushed to check if the answer is correct. The answers are also random generated and i made sure that there weren't mulple answers with the same text. My problem is that when a question is asked, i change the text of an object in my array to \"removed\"; but when i push start again after i've done the quiz, my array has 20 objects with the string \"remove\"; my question is: How can I reset my array to it's normal objects?

I need a way to distinguish from what application state I received a <code>UILocalNotification</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There is one scenario that for me I don't understand. That is when the app is currently running in the foreground and the user pulls down the Notification Center (iOS 5) then the app will get called <code>applicationWillResignActive:</code> which is perfectly logical because it will not be active when the Notification Center will be displayed over it. But I would suspect that also <code>applicationDidEnterBackground:</code> would get called right after it has resigned active <strong>BUT</strong> it does not. So when I receive UILocalNotifications when in the Notification Center my app will try to deal with them in <code>application:didReceiveLocalNotification:</code> but when I tap on a notification from my app that is in the Notification Center list then my app will deal with this notification the same way as it did when I received it in the Notification Center. So I can only handle these notifications in just one way but I would need to handle them in two ways.</p>\n\n<p>So how would I distinguish between these two situations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When the app is in the foreground and the user has pulled down the<br>\nNotification Center and I receive a notification during that time<br>\n(<code>UIApplicationState = UIApplicationStateInactive</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>When the app is in the foreground and the user has pulled down the<br>\nNotification Center and actively chooses one of my app's<br>\nnotifications from the list (<code>UIApplicationState =<br>\nUIApplicationStateInactive</code>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I store all my notifications with a timestamp with 00 seconds. So inside <code>application:didReceiveLocalNotification:</code> I could check the current time <code>[NSDate date]</code> and see if the seconds are bigger than 00? That would mean that it's not iOS who has triggered the notification but the user from the notification center. This of course relays on the fact that the notifications will in fact be delivered by iOS in this timely manner. If iOS will deliver the notification at 01 seconds my logic will break. But for the sake of it I just did some logging to see when iOS delivers my notifications and it seems that judging from the output from the console the notifications are actually delivered on time with millisecond precision (+/- 1).

Pushing the view is a really slow and choppy experience (about 1 fps!) that I want to smooth out.  Comparing to picking a photo on Instagram, I notice that they use a low resolution image and later swap in the full image.

I know I can observe notifications of <code>UIKeyboardDidShowNotification</code> and <code>UIKeyboardDidHideNotification</code></p>\n\n<p>So what would be the best way to deal with this so that these animations are chained together in a smooth way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","cocoa-touch","uitableviewcell"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":342,"score":0,"question_id":11169281,"title":"UITableViewCell with alternate background color in customized cells","body":"<p>I'd like the background to of my UITableViewCells to have a different color every two cells displayed, but when I scroll down and back, they all get the same color.

In that case <code>parentAlbum</code> is set to the selected object.</p>\n\n<p>Now when I add a new <code>Album</code> with the following code, the error occurs.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Album *album = (Album *)[Album itemInManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext];\nalbum.name = @\"Test album\";\nalbum.superAlbum = self.parentAlbum;\n\nNSError *error;\nBOOL success = [self.managedObjectContext save:&amp;error];\n\nif (!success) {\n    NSLog(@\"Error: %@\", error);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strike>The method <code>controller:didChangeObject:atIndexPath:forChangeType:newIndexPath:</code> gets called for with the type <code>NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate</code> for the <code>parentAlbum</code> object. That one's isn't present in the current <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>. So it fails when it tries to update it in the collection view.</p>\n\n<p>How is it possible that an object that isn't in the current <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> is used for a notification? And how can I fix this issue?</strike></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>\nAfter posting the question, I realized that it actually isn't the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> notifying about the wrong object. But it notifies about an object in the previous (parent) collection view, but it does that to it's own collection view controller.</p>\n\n<p>But that might be just the problem; The collection view controller receives a notification while it isn't visible, looks like it can't handle that at this moment. I handle the notification like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller didChangeObject:(id)anObject atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath {    \n    switch (type) {\n        case NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate:\n            [self.collectionView reloadItemsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]];\n            break;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was pretty sure it worked fine before. After iterating over the changes made since last commit, I get it to work again. It did work again after I removed the <code>UICollectionView</code> header (the supplementary view).</p>\n\n<p>So: My <code>UICollectionView</code> can't update items when it has an header and it's not currently visible. That was a tough one to discover, but how can this be fixed? Think it's a really strange issue.</p>\n\n<p>The errors I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012-10-04 11:54:21.148 PhotoLibrary[9195:c07] -[NSISObjectiveLinearExpression coefficientForVariable:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x968bae0\n2012-10-04 11:54:21.151 PhotoLibrary[9195:c07] CoreData: error: Serious application error.

There is one edge case I can't seem to solve. When users enter a new address I use setRegion to zoom in on that location and afterwards I compute the bounds of the map and query my external server with those coordinates. I always call setRegion however, there is one edge case when it will not fire. That, is, when a user magically happens to select the exact same address that lies at the current center of the map, when that map is zoomed to exactly the same region. Of course this possibility is rare but it is easy achievable with the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CLLocation *centerOfMap = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:mapView.centerCoordinate.latitude longitude:mapView.centerCoordinate.longitude];\nmySearchLocation.searchLocation = centerOfMap;\n\n//Recenter and zoom map in on search location\nMKCoordinateRegion region =  {{0.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}};\nregion.center = mySearchLocation.searchLocation.coordinate;region.span.longitudeDelta = 0.01f;\nregion.span.latitudeDelta = 0.01f;\n[self.mapView setRegion:region animated:YES];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would be the equivalent of allowing the user to drop a pin at the center of the current map and fire off a query to my server based on that. Unfortunately because the code logic depends on the region changing (which I've done so that users can easily pan around the map and not have to explicitly press a refresh button), I need a work around. How can I know when setRegion has been called but it won't fire regionWillChange / regionDidChange. Can I override the function some how?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nAs I commented on the first answer, I tried to detect when the region wouldn't change by using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Recenter and zoom map in on search location\nMKCoordinateRegion region =  {{0.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}};\nregion.center = mySearchLocation.searchLocation.coordinate;\nregion.span.longitudeDelta = 0.01f;\nregion.span.latitudeDelta = 0.01f;\nregion = [mapView regionThatFits:region]; //Not sure if this is necessary\n\nNSLog(@\"diff in latitude of center %f\", (mapView.region.center.latitude - region.center.latitude));\nNSLog(@\"diff in longitude of center %f\", (mapView.region.center.longitude - region.center.longitude));\nNSLog(@\"diff in latitude span %f\", (mapView.region.span.latitudeDelta - region.span.latitudeDelta));\nNSLog(@\"diff in longitude span %f\", (mapView.region.span.longitudeDelta - region.span.longitudeDelta));\n\n[self.mapView setRegion:region animated:YES];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately when I set the searchLocation to be the center of the current map I get the following results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>diff in latitude of center 0.000000\ndiff in longitude of center 0.000016\ndiff in latitude span -0.000000\ndiff in longitude span 0.000000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In different cases the error is slightly different but generally speaking even when the region is slightly different like this setRegion or morever, regionDidChange, do not fire. Can anyone explain why? Or how I could go about detecting this properly. Note: I also tried with mapView.centerCoordinate but I get similar errors, and I only want to know when the region will NOT change (if the centerCoordinate is the same the zoom level / region can still be different).</p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","cocoa-touch","design-patterns"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":1,"question_id":12556905,"title":"Why predicate not a property of NSFetchRequest?","body":"<p>NSFetchRequest has methods <code>predicate</code> and <code>setPredicate</code>.

I'm implementing a shared cache in my app. The idea is to get the cached data from the web in the background and then update the cache and the UI with the newly retrieved data.

Here is <a href=\"http://timroadley.com/2012/03/05/core-data-basics-part-7-search-bars/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an adequate tutorial</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The trick is to realize that there are TWO controllers: a table view controller, and a search display controller. Each controller has its own table view. Hence TWO table views are in play: the normal table view and the search display table view. When delegate methods have a UITableView argument, diff which table view is passed in, and do different things accordingly.  </p>\n\n<p>Beyond above basics, data structure becomes a main challenge for me. More specific, how to filter and store the search results? We have three options: </p>\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One FRC for the normal table view </p></li>\n<li><p>Create an array property to store results </p></li>\n<li><p>Use <code>filteredArrayWithPredicate</code> to filter fetched objects (an array) </p></li>\n<li><p>Specify a cache for FRC to store fetched objects in memory to enahnce performance</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>B.</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One FRC for the normal table view</p></li>\n<li><p>Modify FRC's predicate to do the filter.

And it only requires insignificant changes to a table view controller with FRC property. Being more specific, just diff between the two table views in every delegate methods, and add an NSArray property to store fetch results. And, of course, add the filtering code.</p>\n\n<p>B has a potential drawback: FRC delegate methods will get confused on which fetch request is being used? Is the one before search, or during search, or after search? Although there might be solution out there, I don't think it worth the time provided that solution A is working. </p>\n\n<p>The second drawback is that, if we want search results to change on the fly. Every single letter user types in search bar will cause FRC to performFetch, which is rather expensive.</p>\n\n<p>C avoids B's first drawback by using two FRC, yet it suffers from the second for exactly same reason. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Other things to consider:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do filtering in a background queue. So when user type in search bar, screen won't get blocked no matter how expensive your filtering is. </p></li>\n<li><p>Create a helper method to diff between the two table views. Call the helper method in relevant delegate methods, which would make code cleaner.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Above are my understanding of implement search in table view.

But when I leave the view, it and its controller are dealloc'd, but do not seem to give up anywhere near the memory they had taken up.

While this works fine when an event did indeed happen at a certain moment in time, it's much more of a hassle to work with <code>NSDate</code> when you're dealing with something that's a recurring event. For example, I'm currently working on an app that stores the hours of operation of businesses. Most businesses have a weekly schedule, which means that I would like to store the times per weekday, regardless of the date.</p>\n\n<p>There are several solutions: create an extra entity (I'm working with Core Data), Hours, with attributes weekday, hour, and minute and figure it out that way. This could work for simple displaying, but I'm also going to add a \"status\" (such as \"open until x\", \"closing in y minutes\", or \"will open at z\"). This means I'll either have to create <code>NSDate</code> objects to do the comparing, or I take the weekday, hour, and minute properties of the current <code>NSDate</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another option would be to store two <code>NSDate</code>s per business (open and close), and ignore the actual date and only use the weekday, hour, and minute properties.
