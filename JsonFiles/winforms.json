On my form I have a datagridview with some controls for some query fields.  Users type in street name/number/direction etc. then get back results in the datagrid.  The grid uses a bindingSource together with a bindingNavigator to get the results.  I can navigate, get results back as a list&lt;> from my DAL and call the update Stored proc which works well.  However when I use the built-in commands for adding a new record, it successfully adds the record to the grid, but when I try to use GetChangeSet in the DAL on the DataContext I have 0 inserts showing. </p>\n\n<p>So the DataContext is tracking my changes to existing records but not seeing any added records.  I am using a private static datacontext in DAL.  I guess the question is how do I go about adding the new record and passing that to my stored proc method??  I don't see any way to \"get added record(s)\" from bindingsource, or how could I use the grid to see if I need to add a new record??</p>\n\n<p>Code in UI/Form that calls my DAL</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        // Call search query\n        spSearchCardsResultBindingSource.DataSource = \n            SideSewer.QueryCards(permit:txtPermit.Text, \n            parcel: txtParcel.Text, streetNum: nullNum1,\n            streetNum2: nullNum2, streetDirection: cbDirection.Text, \n            streetName: txtName.Text, streetType: cbType.Text,\n            inspected: inspectedNull, includeAliases: ckbxAlias.Checked);\n    }\n\n    private void saveToolStripButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        // This line below actually WORKS, yet it just adds the record \n        // user currently has selected may NOT be the NEW one!!\n        SideSewer.InsertData((PermitInfo)spSearchCardsResultBindingSource.Current);\n\n        if (!SideSewer.save())\n            MessageBox.Show(\"There was a problem saving the record(s)\");\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the code for querying the records and doing the save.

The column is hosting a third-party component. I enter edit mode in the cell and modify its value and then I press enter key to validate the value. The problem is that I have to press enter key twice to validate the value. It seems like first enter key is to validate the value in the third-party's editor hosted in the cell, and second one to validate the <code>DataGridView</code>'s cell... So how to validate cell's value with only pressing enter key one time? </p>\n\n<p>Also I have seen strange behaviour, for example, the last <code>DataGridView</code>'s row does not behaves as the rest of the <code>DataGridView</code>'s cells. For last row, if I edit the value of a cell and then press enter key to validate, after validating value, it always remains in the same cell and in edit mode and cell's value gets selected so user can think that cell value is invalid when in fact it isn't. This does not happen with the rest of the rows. They need to press enter key twice to validate and cells do not remain in edit mode after validating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:\nRegarding to the need to press enter key twice:\nIn the custom cell, when enter key is pressed for first time, it raises the event that says value for the cell has changed, it is in this case, OnSourceValueChanged (this is the event raised for the third-party when value has changed) so into it I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        this.valueChanged = true;\n        this.EditingControlDataGridView.NotifyCurrentCellDirty(true);\n        base.OnSourceValueChanged(e);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when executed NotifyCurrentCellDirty it raises CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged on datagridview which code is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            if (this.gridView.IsCurrentCellDirty)\n        {\n            this.gridView.CurrentCell.DataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);\n            this.gridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After it, DataError event is raised for the datagridview but cell continues in edit mode so I would like to commit the value and exit edit mode. How to do this? Also I have tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.dataGridView.CurrentCell.DataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this.dataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);</p>\n\n<p>in DataError handler but it does not work.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, cellvaluechanged is not raised maybe as it is a hosted control in the cell...I don't understand why I have to press enter key twice to commit and validate changes on the cell and exit edit mode for the cell.

I included 4-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit variants.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the results on both 32-bit and 16-bit displays:</p>\n\n<h2>On 32-bit displays, all is well:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Windows Explorer:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eDurb.png\" alt=\"Windows Explorer, 32-bit display\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>WPF Application:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VEush.png\" alt=\"WPF Application, 32-bit display\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Windows Forms Application:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yAMSR.png\" alt=\"Windows Forms Application, 32-bit display\"></p>\n\n<h2>On 16-bit displays, Windows Forms displays a lower-color-depth variant of the icon than does WPF or Windows Explorer:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Windows Explorer:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dVVmx.png\" alt=\"Windows Explorer, 16-bit display\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>WPF Application:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pU7gz.png\" alt=\"WPF Application, 16-bit display\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Windows Forms Application:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wDIZO.png\" alt=\"Windows Forms Application, 16-bit display\"></p>\n\n<p>On 16-bit displays, Windows Explorer and WPF use the 24-bit format, but Windows Forms does not.

That is, the control reflects the property value (as long as it's not null), but it doesn't update the entity when I pick another date in the UI.</p>\n\n<p>In line with the recent Windows Forms policy of not throwing exceptions but rather pretend all is well even when things fail (a major annoyance in my book; Form_Load too now just swallows exceptions, though in this case of course we're way past Form_Load before the error occurs). So in fact I can't even tell if it's <em>trying</em> to do anything, but I have to assume it is, given that the two-way binding is working perfectly fine as long as the property isn't nullable.</p>\n\n<p>How can I overcome this?</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to do is write a base class for presenters in the application which has the ability to databind controls based on a simple naming convention. The presenter knows that for TextBox it should bind the Text property, for CheckBox it should bind \"Checked\", and so on. The mapping between properties and controls is done by convention - controls presenting a field should have the same name as the field plus the control type. Hence \"Name\" presented in a TextBox maps to \"NameTextBox\" (which is the convention I like to use anyway - I have never understood why people are still fond of prefixes specifically with GUI controls, but no other kind of code!?) and \"IsMarried\" in a checkbox would become \"IsMarriedCheckBox\". </p>\n\n<p>All of this allows the presenter to offer a method that accepts an object, \"datasource\", and a container where the controls to be bound are living. This makes for very rapid work adding a bunch of fields to a screen compared to having to use a bindingsource and write code, a solution which like mine does not give any compiler checks and does mean it's easy to break things by mistypes and property renames. </p>\n\n<p>But to make my little PoC I want to know what I can handle with this, and what sorts of things will still require other solutions. The whole thing would be considerably more valuable if it could support properties of nullable types, since we use them a lot. (Nor do I want to stop using them; bundling together the concept of \"has a value\" and if so \"which value\" is elegant and makes for less code, as well as more compiler help.) </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way? Anything I can hook into? Or possible to make a generic type of my own to replace Nullable&lt;T&gt;? Since I don't understand why it doesn't work without me having to do anything, it's difficult to imagine what might be worth trying to work around it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["winforms","fonts","monthcalendar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13248835,"title":"Cannot change font in WinForms MonthCalendar control","body":"<pre><code>MonthCalendar1.Font = newFont\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>doesn't work if we assign a new font.

If I use Approach 1 (mouse move), the measured distance between the last item painted and the right edge of the canvas is different from what I set in positionShift and the cursor position difference does not equal positionShift. I initially thought it was due to pointer ballistics issues so I tried using Approach 2. Approach 2 does give me precision in pointer positioning but I am still having dissiculty in that the panel moves but the distance between the last bar painted and the right edge of the canvas does not equal the positionShift amount as it should. It always seems to be off. I have been working on this for a long time now and am at my wits end. I am not sure what is going on here. Any suggestions as to how to imporove the precision in my canvas drag by simulated mouse drag would be greatly appreciated.

Also I set the list view column type to Control.\nIf I add elements to ListView and isn't databinded that the buttons appear.</p>\n\n<p>So it will be a great help for me to know if buttons could be displayed in column that is not databinded when the listview uses databinding for rest of columns.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","winforms"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13227565,"title":"Setting datagridviewcomboboxcell value","body":"<p>I have following code to bind combo box cell which works properlly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Const colIndex As Integer = 1\n        Dim dgvcombo As DataGridViewComboBoxCell\n        dgvcombo = gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(\"SerialNumber\")\n        dtGrpBrand = getDataTable(\"select * from (select SSPERPSerialMaster.ProductID,SSPERPSerialMaster.SizeID,SSPERPSerialMaster.GaugeID, SSPERPSerialMaster.SerialID,SSPERPSerialMaster.SerialNumber,ISNULL(SSPERPSerialEntryOpening.Qty,0)+ISNULL(a.Stock,0) as [Closing Qty] \" &amp; _\n                        \"from SSPERPProductMaster \" &amp; _\n                        \"left join SSPERPSerialMaster on SSPERPSerialMaster.ProductID=SSPERPProductMaster.ProductID \" &amp; _\n                        \"left join SSPERPSerialEntryOpening on SSPERPSerialEntryOpening.SerialID=SSPERPSerialMaster.SerialID and SSPERPSerialMaster.ProductID=SSPERPSerialEntryOpening.ProductID \" &amp; _\n                        \"left join (select SerialId,SUM(ISNULL(case when AL='A' then Qty else - Qty end, 0)) as [Stock] from SSPERPStock group by SerialId) a on a.SerialId=SSPERPSerialMaster.SerialID) a \" &amp; _\n                        \"where a.[Closing Qty]&lt;&gt;0 and a.ProductID=\" &amp; gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(\"ProductId\").Value.ToString() &amp; \" and a.SizeID=\" &amp; gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(\"SizeId\").Value.ToString() &amp; \" and a.GaugeID=\" &amp; gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(\"GaugeId\").Value.ToString(), CompanyCon)\n        dtGrpBrand.Rows.Add()\n        dtGrpBrand.Rows(dtGrpBrand.Rows.Count - 1)(\"SerialNumber\") = \"-- Select --\"\n        dtGrpBrand.Rows(dtGrpBrand.Rows.Count - 1)(\"SerialId\") = 0\n        dgvcombo.AutoComplete = True\n        CType(gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(colIndex), DataGridViewComboBoxCell).DataSource = dtGrpBrand\n        CType(gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(colIndex), DataGridViewComboBoxCell).DisplayMember = \"SerialNumber\"\n        CType(gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(colIndex), DataGridViewComboBoxCell).ValueMember = \"SerialId\"\n        CType(gvMain.Rows(_rowindex).Cells(colIndex), DataGridViewComboBoxCell).Value = 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this codes work perfectlly in my application while i have insert mode of data, but when user choose record from list, than i need to bond dynamically that cell of \"SerialNumber\",\nAt That time also i am properlly binding datagridviewcimboboxcell through this code, it binds my combobox cell properlly but when i give following code to set value it is not working and give me error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gvMain.Rows(gvMain.Rows.Count - 1).Cells(\"SerialNumber\").Value = dtrow(\"SerialId\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also tried following line to get selected value but no solution:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CType(gvMain.Rows(gvMain.Rows.Count - 1).Cells(\"SerialNumber\"), DataGridViewComboBoxCell).Value = dtrow(\"SerialId\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here gvmain is datagridview and dtrow is datarow</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","radio","trackbar"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13232085,"title":"How can I control system sound volume with a TrackBar?","body":"<p>I'm a beginner and making an internet radio player and I want to control the volume with my own <code>TrackBar</code>.

My boss asked me to set the tab order, and then trap keypress so the user can use enter to navigate controls. I have 2 apps like this to work on.</p>\n\n<p>For the tab order, I could not use the View/TabOrder feature, since there are so many blue little tabindex popups showing, that I can not see any of the controls on the form to click. I tried clicking 'through' the popup with some success, but it still did not give me the tab order I wanted. The tab assistant that came with CodeSMART did not give me the result I wanted, either, so I could use it. </p>\n\n<p>The controls on this usercontrol are spread among many groups, which in turn are spread among several splitcontainer panels. The 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupboxes which are selected via a toolstripbutton ( which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible.) </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub ShowMainPanel()\n    'Note: Panels are groupboxes\n    Me.MaterialPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.HaulPanel.Visible = False\n    Me.MainPanel.Visible = True\n\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each of these groupboxes contain more groupboxes, each of which contain 1 to 15 controls. Some are read only, but others need information from the user. The required controls have their tab stop set to true.</p>\n\n<p>So I MANUALLY set each of the main group panels tabindexes as 0 thru 2. Then for the 1st groupbox(mainpanel), I set the tabindex for each of it's controls and groupboxes that are contained within. The non-container type controls have their tabindexes set to 0 thru 25, and then the groupboxes (sub groups) on the mainpanel are 26 thru 48. I then went to each control in these sub groups and set tab index for those controls starting at 0 thru Control.count-1 for the group. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, my tab orders look like this (abbreviated):</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainPanel = 0\n  1st fields = 0.0\n  2ndfield = 0.1\n  3rd field = 0.2\n  1st group = 0.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 0.3.1\n  2nd group = 0.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 0.4.1\nmaterialPanel = 1\n  1st fields = 1.0\n  2ndfield = 1.1\n  3rd field = 1.2\n  1st group = 1.3\n    1st field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp1 = 1.3.1\n  2nd group = 1.4\n    1st field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.0\n    2nd field in 1st grp2 = 1.4.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: I did not actually enter, for instance, 1.4.0 for a tabindex, but 0 for the control, 4 for the sub group and 1 for main group.</p>\n\n<p>I then set the zorder via the Document Outline panel in based on the tab order.</p>\n\n<p>Once I did all of this I was finally able to get the tab order I wanted to work for the mainpanel. </p>\n\n<p>But when I applied the same to the other 2 groupboxes (materialPanel and haulpanel), the tabs are completely ignored. Tab does not work at all within the app. for the 2nd to main groupboxes (MaterialPanel and HaulPanel).

The HUD will show some boxes with some information. The boxes must be draggable and semi-transparent, and the user can set their opacity. When the mouse hovers one of these boxes, additional information is displayed. I have no control over the PokerStars window that will have the HUD, that is I cannot edit it in Visual Studio.\nI need some advices about how to achieve this, and what is the best way to do this.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt was about using Windows Forms with SetParent function via PInvoke, but transparency is not working:</p>\n\n<p>My HUD is just a set of semi-transparent boxes that must provide additional information to the window they are attached to. The problem is that I cannot make my hud element semi-transparent when it is inside another application's form. My hud element is a box that inherits from the Form class. It's nothing but a borderless form (BorderStyle is set to \"None\", 100% opacity) with some colored labels inside, no code was added when creating it. So, I have a main form class called Form1 and another form class called HUDBox which is the hud element I want to display inside Form1. Both inherit from the Form class.\nIf I set HUDBox object's opacity to anything less then 100%, the HUDBox object just won't display inside Form1 object. I also tried using TransparencyKey, SetWindowLong and SetLayeredWindowAttributes via PInvoke but it makes everything transparent, not just the HUDBox object. Here is the code:</p>\n\n<p>Program.cs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing System.Text;\n\nnamespace MyHUD\n{\n    public static class Program\n    {\n        public static Form1 mainForm;\n\n        [STAThread]\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Application.EnableVisualStyles();\n            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\n            mainForm = new Form1();\n            HUD psHUD = new HUD();\n            Application.Run(mainForm);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>HUD.cs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Drawing;\n\nnamespace MyHUD\n{\n\n    class HUD\n    {\n        private static int HOW_MANY_HUDBOXES = 4;\n\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n        static extern IntPtr SetParent(IntPtr hWndChild, IntPtr hWndNewParent);\n\n        private List&lt;HUDBox&gt; hudBoxes = new List&lt;HUDBox&gt;(HOW_MANY_HUDBOXES);\n\n        public HUD()\n        {\n            initHudBoxes();\n        }\n\n        private void initHudBoxes()\n        {\n            for (int hb = 0; hb &lt; HOW_MANY_HUDBOXES; hb++)\n            {\n                HUDBox newHudBox = new HUDBox();\n                hudBoxes.Add(newHudBox);\n                //SetParent(newHudBox.Handle, Program.mainForm.Handle);\n                newHudBox.Show();\n            }\n            UserControl1 control = new UserControl1();\n            SetParent(control.Handle, Program.mainForm.Handle);\n            control.Show();\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Code for HUDBox.cs and Form1.cs are not relevant as they are simple auto-generated Forms. This program adds 4 copies of my hud element inside the main form. My Form1 class is just for testing, it will be replaced by the external PokerStars window.\nOpacity works fine for my hud boxes when I don't use the SetParent function, because they are not set as Form1's children.</p>\n\n<p>I've also tried to use a UserControl instead of my HUDBox form:\nUserControl1.cs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace MyHUD\n{\n    public partial class UserControl1 : UserControl\n    {\n        public UserControl1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            SetStyle(ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor, true);\n            this.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(127, 0, 0, 255);\n        }\n\n        private void UserControl1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've manually added this UserControl1 to Form1 using VisualStudio, and it shows fine with correct opacity, but then I added another UserControl1 via SetParent and the transparency doesn't work:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VDchg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Screenshot</a></p>\n\n<p>I've also tried to use combinations of the following functions but nothing worked, the transparency applied to the whole window instad of just the hud elements inside it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n        static extern int SetWindowLong(IntPtr hWnd, int nIndex, int dwNewLong);\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n        static extern bool SetLayeredWindowAttributes(IntPtr hwnd, uint crKey, byte bAlpha, uint dwFlags);\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError=true)]\n        static extern int GetWindowLong(IntPtr hWnd, int nIndex);\n\n        public const int GWL_EXSTYLE = -20;\n        public const int WS_EX_LAYERED = 0x80000;\n        public const int LWA_ALPHA = 0x2;\n        public const int LWA_COLORKEY = 0x1;\n\n        //set the window style to alpha appearance\n        private void setWindowOpacity(IntPtr handle, byte opacity)\n        {\n            SetLayeredWindowAttributes(handle, 0, opacity, LWA_ALPHA);\n        }\n\n        private void setWindowLayered(IntPtr handle)\n        {\n            SetWindowLong(handle, GWL_EXSTYLE, GetWindowLong(handle, GWL_EXSTYLE) ^ WS_EX_LAYERED);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a way to make my hud elements children of the PokerStars window keeping the correct transparency?</p>\n\n<p>Is there another way for creating this HUD, maybe by using GDI?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","c#-4.0","dataset"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13208996,"title":"evade deleted row of dataset in database table","body":"<p>I dont know what to keep the heading (still confused, sorry for that).

Since every functionality is mostly independent (they all use the same database, but there is no direct interaction between different functionalities), I'm using the user defined controls and treating them as individual \"applications\". The way the application works is this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The \"root\" application only contains the main menu and 2 panels. The main menu is used to select the group of functionalities.</li>\n<li>After the group is selected (on application startup the first group is automatically selected), the functionalities (represented by buttons) from that group are displayed in the first panel.</li>\n<li><p>The user selects the functionality (by clicking on the appropriate button) he/she wants and the user control that contains the \"form\" is displayed in the second panel.\nThe code that displays all of the user controls looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    panel2.Controls.Clear();\n    UserControl1 uc1 = new UserControl1();\n    uc1.Location = new Point(0, 0);\n    panel2.Controls.Add(uc1);\n    label6.Text = \"User control 1\";\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, when the user selects one of the functionalities, the application clears existing controls, and displays the selected one.\nThe application works fine (the part I implemented so far), so this is my question - how does this approach manage computer resources, mainly the memory. Specifically, if the user uses one functionality, and then switches to another one, will the .NET's services release the memory used by the previous functionality (I think garbage collector is in charge of that) and will the SQL connections, that I use to communicate with the database, be closed?\nAlso, are there some other issues that I should be aware of?\nAs I said, the functionalities work properly, but I'm still very far from full testing of the application as a whole (I only test every functionality individually when I create it, and only on the computer I create it on, so I can't consider it as a proper testing). Because of that, I am worried that the application's performances might deteriorate if the application is constantly used over a longer period of time.\nI'm using VS 2010 (C#) and SQL Server 2005 to create this application.\nIf you have any suggestions, please write them.

I don't see this issue when using a WPF button.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that since the <code>System.Windows.Forms.Button</code> class supports <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373592%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSAA</a> instead of the UIA, the part of UIA that is bridging the MSAA interface is misbehaving, or at least behaving in a way that I don't understand and can't find any documentation about.\nMaybe it's reporting an invoke event for mouse down, up, click, and then the actual button press?</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone explain this behavior, and/or provide a workaround so that one button press results in one invoke event?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is under WinXP SP3.  I just installed the <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976779\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows Automation API 3.0</a> <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971513\" rel=\"nofollow\">update</a> and still see the same behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I found <a href=\"http://www.universalthread.com/ViewPageArticle.aspx?ID=199\" rel=\"nofollow\">this example</a> where the author off-handedly mentions this behavior as a bug in the Win32 control, but cites no evidence...</p>\n\n<p>Here's my sample application (form with a button on it), along with event listening baked into it.  Add references to <code>UIAutomationClient</code> and <code>UIAutomationTypes</code>.  Click the button and see invoke happen four times instead of one.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>using System;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Windows.Automation;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace WindowsFormsApplication6\n{\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        private TextBox m_Output;\n\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n\n            // set up the GUI with a single button...\n            Button b = new Button {Location = new Point(5, 5), Name = \"Test\", Text = \"Click Me\"};\n            // ... and a textbox to write events to.\n            m_Output = new TextBox { Location = new Point(5, 30), Name = \"Output\", Multiline = true, Size = new Size(250, 200) };\n\n            this.Controls.Add(b);\n            this.Controls.Add(m_Output);\n\n            // get the button as an UIA element\n            AutomationElement button = AutomationElement.FromHandle(b.Handle);\n            // attach a handler to the button, listening for the Invoke event\n            Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler(\n                                                 InvokePattern.InvokedEvent,\n                                                 button,\n                                                 TreeScope.Element,\n                                                 OnInvoked);\n        }\n\n        // Handler for button invoke events\n        private void OnInvoked(object Sender, AutomationEventArgs E)\n        {\n            AppendText(\"Invoked: \" + ((AutomationElement)Sender).Current.AutomationId);\n        }\n\n        // Just dumps text to the textbox\n        private void AppendText(string Text)\n        {\n            if (m_Output.InvokeRequired)\n            {\n                m_Output.BeginInvoke((Action&lt;string&gt;)AppendText, Text);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                m_Output.AppendText(DateTime.Now.ToString(\"hh:mm:ss.fff\") + \": \" + Text + Environment.NewLine);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","scroll","custom-controls","autoscroll"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":1,"question_id":13129517,"title":"Fixed part in custom painted usercontrol with autoscroll c# windows forms","body":"<p>I would like to create a table like control where a number of top rows stay in place when scrolling.\nI paint the control in an override of the OnPaint method.</p>\n\n<p>When scrolling some partial repaint happens automatically, but this creates artefacts and looks weird.

Selecting an item in A pulls some info from a database, puts it in Dictionary, and uses BindingSource to put it in B.

In its SelectedIndexChanged handler, attempting to unbox  its SelectedItem causes the ComboBox to 'freeze' so it no longer displays the result of new selections from ListBox B and long lists do not refresh when scrolled up/down.

The CatIDs in DemoCategories would be values like Age20to30, Age20to40 ... etc. so that RegionHasDemo represents age group populations for all the regions.</p>\n\n<p>In my application I want to create a form to add region data along with all of the related data. To do this I've created the two binding sources, one for RegionData and one for RegionHasDemo that contains RegionData as it's DataSource. For various reasons on my form I would like to enter the data for RegionHasDemo by binding individual text boxes to the DataRowViews contained in the List property of the RegionHasDemoBindingSource. Note, I do not want to use a grid view.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code that I use to bind to the text boxes every time the Current property of the RegionData changes:</p>\n\n<p>Note: the table names are different from my sample, RegionData = UNITS; RegionHasDemo = UnitExp; DemoCategories = CatExp.</p>\n\n<p><pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"></p>\n\n<code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Data.OleDb;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace DBsample\n{\n        public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        private DataTable DataSource;\n        private string relatedTableName;\n\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Holsd the values needed to define my text box rows and \n        /// relate them to the table containing their human readable\n        /// names, sort order, and active record status.\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        private struct textBoxRow\n        {\n            public string Key { get; set; }\n            public TextBox TBox { get; set; }\n            public Label NameLabel { get; set; }\n            public string Name { get; set; }\n            public int Value { get; set; }\n        }\n        textBoxRow[] rows;\n\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n\n\n            DataSource = injuryDB.UnitExp;\n            relatedTableName = \"CatExpUnitExp\";\n\n        }\n\n        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            this.uNITSTableAdapter.Fill(this.injuryDB.UNITS);\n            this.catExpTableAdapter1.Fill(this.injuryDB.CatExp);\n            this.unitExpTableAdapter1.Fill(this.injuryDB.UnitExp);\n            // Fill data table\n            // Associate them in the struct in sorted order \n\n            // Get a list of categories\n            DataTable catTable = DataSource.ParentRelations[relatedTableName].ParentTable;\n\n            // Sort them while leaving out the ones we don't want\n            List&lt;DataRow&gt; tbr = (from r in catTable.AsEnumerable()\n                                    where r.Field&lt;bool&gt;(\"ActiveRecord\")\n                                    orderby r.Field&lt;int&gt;(\"SortOrder\")\n                                    select r).ToList();\n\n            // The rows we are going to show\n            rows = new textBoxRow[tbr.Count];\n            tableLayoutPanel1.RowStyles.Clear();\n            int rowIndex = 0;\n\n            // Create rows and add them to the form\n            foreach (DataRow r in tbr)\n            {\n                textBoxRow tRow = new textBoxRow();\n\n                Label lbl = new Label();\n                lbl.Text = r.Field&lt;string&gt;(\"CatName\");\n\n                TextBox tb = new TextBox();\n\n\n                tRow.Key = r.Field&lt;string&gt;(\"Category\");\n                tRow.Name = r.Field&lt;string&gt;(\"CatName\");\n                tRow.TBox = tb;\n                tRow.NameLabel = lbl;\n\n                tableLayoutPanel1.RowStyles.Add(new RowStyle(SizeType.AutoSize));\n                tableLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(tRow.NameLabel, 0, rowIndex);\n                tableLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(tRow.TBox, 1, rowIndex);\n\n                rows[rowIndex] = tRow;\n                rowIndex++;\n            }\n\n            // Refresh the bindings in the text boxes when the current item changes\n            unitCatExpBindingSource.CurrentItemChanged += currentItemChanged;\n            currentItemChanged(null, null);\n        }\n\n        private void uNITSBindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            bool validated = this.Validate();\n            if(validated == true)\n                Debug.WriteLine(\"Validated data to be saved\");\n            else\n                Debug.WriteLine(\"Did not validate data to be saved\");\n            this.uNITSBindingSource.EndEdit();\n            int recordsUpdated = this.tableAdapterManager.UpdateAll(this.injuryDB);\n            Debug.WriteLine(string.Format(\"{0} records were changed\", recordsUpdated));\n\n\n        }\n        private void currentItemChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (rows == null) return;\n\n            // For some reason I have to pass this into the bindingSource's find method instead of a \n            // straight string of the column name.

The changes don't save to the database. The changes I make in the text boxes will persist in the DataSet (when i move away from the record and come back they stay the same) but when I save the dataSet close the form and open it back up again the changes are gone. It's as if the dataSet wasn't notified that those values were changed. Furthermore, if I put the related data in a data grid along side my custom text box list I am able to modify the data from the DataGridView and I am able to save the data. Also, when I change the data in my TextBoxes the new values will show up in the DataGridView but still won't be saved...</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering is the method that I use to bind the text boxes to the data correct. Meaning, can I bind data in the form of a DataRowView contained inside a Binding source and expect it to behave the same as if I used the binding source directly?</p>\n\n<p>Your help is much appreciated. I hope I've given enough information for you to go on. Keep in mind that this code sample is from a prototype. I understand that that it is not best practice. That said I would appreciate any constructive criticism. </p>\n\n<p>Also, would somebody please vote me up so that I can vote other people up.

How can I close the connection without messing up the invoke and UI thread?</p>\n\n<p>Here is my close method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void DisconnectFromSerialPort()\n{\n    if (Connection != null &amp;&amp; Connection.IsOpen)\n    {\n        Connection.Close();            \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>As Hans said I changed <code>Invoke</code> to <code>BeginInvoke</code> but now its a bit worse, my application stops working due to <code>InvalidOperationException</code> because the collection <code>_readBuffer</code> was modified (Thats what the detail says in VS)</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code for adding text to textbox:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void AddReceivedPacketToTextBox(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n\n    foreach (var i in _readBuffer)\n        tbIn.Text += string.Format(\"{0:X2} \", i);\n\n    tbIn.Text += Environment.NewLine;\n\n    ScrollToBottom(tbIn);\n\n    label4.Text = _receivedPackets.ToString();\n    _receivedPackets++;\n\n    _readBuffer.Clear(); //Possibly because clearing collection gets out of sync with BeginInvoke??         \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>2nd Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I still have the problem, changing the <code>Invoke()</code> to <code>BeginInvoke</code> didn;t help. I also tried to add disconnect to form closing event nu success...anytime I close my form it gets stock (I mean its parent form, because this form that has access to serialport is being called from another form`.</p>\n\n<p>I mean I figured out that the UI gets locked only in 2 cases: If I clock a button which calls <code>Connection.Close()</code>  also if I try to close the form, the parent form will throw exception that some objects are disposed.</p>\n\n<p>I call the serial form like this from the parent form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public DebugForm DebugForm;\n\nprivate void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    if (DebugForm != null)\n    {\n        DebugForm.BringToFront();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    DebugForm = new DebugForm();\n    DebugForm.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.CenterScreen;\n    DebugForm.Closed += delegate\n                             {\n                                 WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal;\n                                 DebugForm = null;\n                             };\n\n    DebugForm.Show();\n    WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Could this be the problem?!</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","winforms","autocomplete","combobox"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":129,"score":0,"question_id":9382769,"title":"Autocomplete combobox mantaining character case","body":"<p>I have a control that inherits from a combobox and uses its capabilities to Autocomplete, Suggest and Append to show the user the top 10 most used names in our country that starts with the text that the user introduced.</p>\n\n<p>In order to explain what I vant to change I will use an example:</p>\n\n<p>1.- The user enters the text \"dav\" in the comobo (not a single Uppercase letter).</p>\n\n<p>2.- The combo searches for the top 10 most used names and comes with a list (like the following image)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lFGkI.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>3.- When You access the Mybase.Text the combo will return you \"Dav\" with the first letter capitalized.

The standard method to find the average width of a character starts from getting the width of all alphabetic characters and divide by 52:</p>\n\n<pre><code>size = dc.GetTextExtent(\n       \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", 52);\naverageWidth = size / 52;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Microsoft has a page that lists the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb847924.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">average character widths</a> for some font sizes at certain DPI settings, and i've confirmed them by my own calls to GetTextExtent.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tahoma 8pt, 96dpi:</strong> 13x6 px</li>\n<li><strong>Tahoma 9pt, 96dpi:</strong> 14x7 px</li>\n<li><strong>Segoe UI 9pt, 96dpi</strong>: 15x7 px</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now i want to perform the same calculations under .NET WinForms. Using Graphics.MeasureString() i come up with code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static SizeF GetAvgCharSizeF(Graphics g, Font font)\n{\n   String s = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\n\n   SizeF textSize = g.MeasureString(s, font);\n\n   float baseUnitX = (textSize.Width / s.Length);\n   float baseUnitY = textSize.Height;\n\n   return new SizeF(baseUnitX, baseUnitY);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunatly the values do not match the known, accepted, true values:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tahoma 8pt, 96dpi:</strong> 14x6 px <em>(14.21x6.09 px)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Tahoma 9pt, 96dpi:</strong> 16x7 px <em>(15.98x6.85 px)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Segoe UI 9pt, 96dpi:</strong> 17x7 px <em>(17.46x6.91 px)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The average character widths turn out OK, but the character heights are too large by about 13%. i assume that the extra height is due to a difference in the classification of height having been changed to include ascenders and descenders. If the measuring string was measuring too tall, i tried changing it from:</p>\n\n<pre><code>String s = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>String s = \"acemnorsuvwxyz\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>thinking that now the string is not as tall, and so the measured Height should be shorter. Nope, it returns the <em>exact</em> same heights as the version of the string that included ascenders and descenders (although the average widths are slightly larger).</p>\n\n<p>What can be the cause of this, and can get the average character height what can be done to the average text height so that it matches the accepted values returned by GetTextExtent?</p>\n\n<p>Note: Even though the standard practice to get the average character height is to use GetTextMetrics, the height returned by GetTextExtents returns the same value.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":71,"score":-2,"question_id":12983049,"title":"Item does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments","body":"<p>The new Form1() part of this code (this code is in my Main.cs) keeps giving me this error - HomeInventory2.Form1 does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void cDsToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    var form = new Form1();\n    // show the form\n    form.Show();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Form1 code is as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace HomeInventory2\n{\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n\n        public Form1(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; prepopulated)\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            IEnumerable&lt;String&gt; lines = prepopulated;\n            textBoxAmount.Text = lines.ElementAtOrDefault(0);\n            textBoxCategories.Text = lines.ElementAtOrDefault(1);\n            textBoxProperties.Text = lines.ElementAtOrDefault(2);\n            textBoxValue.Text = lines.ElementAtOrDefault(3);\n        }\n\n        private void label1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n\n        }\n\n        private void submitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            CreateInventory create = new CreateInventory();\n            create.ItemAmount = textBoxAmount.Text;\n            create.ItemCategory = textBoxCategories.Text;\n            create.ItemProperties = textBoxValue.Text;\n            create.ItemValue = textBoxValue.Text;\n\n            InventoryMngr invtryMngr = new InventoryMngr();\n            invtryMngr.Create(create);\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried just putting a blank constructor in there - but then of course when that button or menu item is called it just brings up a blank screen.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","flash","externalinterface"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":936,"score":3,"question_id":2143292,"title":"C# Flash - ExternalInterface","body":"<p>We are hosting the ActiveX control in a WinForms application to embed flash.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a good way to get the list of visible ExternalInterface functions that are available for any given swf file?</p>\n\n<p>We are working with a 3rd party swf file, and do not have access to source.</p>\n\n<p>If it's not possible from C# (or code), is there a tool out there that can do it?</p>\n\n<p>ANSWER:  The only way I've found is to use a flash decompiler and then look for the line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ExternalInterface.addCallback(\"methodName\", methodName);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm marking the top answer as the answer for the help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":955,"score":1,"question_id":7448975,"title":"Flow Layout Panel issues","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a list of controls.

I don't need to 'design' anything on it and actually its height is set to 0).</p>\n\n<p>Everything works as intended at run time, but at design time, it seems like whenever I open the child control in Design mode to work on it, Visual Studio keeps increasing the width on me, by perhaps a couple hundred pixels at a time (or possibly some factor).  Before I know it, the thing is 10,000 plus pixels wide and then I have to reset the width in the designer just so it is manageable.  This isn't an issue at run time, because the controls width gets set by a parent container it is put in, and the control is anchored to the parent.  Its just a pain while designing the controls.  Here's just little snippets to better explain what I've done:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class BaseRow : UserControl\n{\n    public BaseRow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n\n        ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I want to actually create controls that inherit from this BaseRow, but that I can edit in the designer.  So, I go to Add -> UserControl.  Then in the class code I change the default created code to inherit from my BaseRow (which inherits from UserControl) so it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// changed the inheritance below from UserControl to BaseRow (which inherits from UserControl)\npublic partial class UnitRow : BaseRow\n{\n    public UnitRow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I originally set the width of the objects to 400 in both the base class and the child class in the designer.  The base Row sets its Anchor property in its constructor:</p>\n\n<p><code>this.Anchor = AnchorStyles.Top | AnchorStyles.Left | AnchorStyles.Right;</code></p>\n\n<p>because these controls will all go in a subclassed panel control that will control the width of rows that are added to it.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works fine at run time.  The actual width of these 'Row' controls I have created is set correctly and changes appropriately based on its parent subclassed panel control.  But when I open the row controls in design mode at design time, the width is constantly getting longer and longer.  Everytime the width equal 10,000 or more I manually change it back in the Properties window to a width of 400.</p>\n\n<p>Its not causing any major issue.  But it is a real pain.

I'm not too sure how it would work with different methods. </p>\n\n<p>So for example I have the following code (adapted from <a href=\"http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/06/understanding-c-using-backgrou.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/06/understanding-c-using-backgrou.html</a> for illustration purposes):</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void getDateTime()\n{\n    DateTime startTime = DateTime.Now;\n    double value = Math.E;\n    while (DateTime.Now &lt; startTime.AddMilliseconds(100)) \n    {\n      value /= Math.PI;\n      value *= Math.Sqrt(2);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)\n{\n    for(int i=0; i &lt;= 100; i++)\n    {\n        getDateTime();\n        backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(i);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would continually calculate the DateTime using the backgroundworker thread. Now I'm assuming that the for-loop within the backgroundworker's DoWork method would run the calculation, report the progress, and then reiterate the loop (please do correct me if I've misunderstood). </p>\n\n<p>Now assuming I have another method, which parses a (presumably large) DataTable and returns another DataTable, using it in the backgroundworker would mean I'd be parsing the DataTable over and over (theoretically. again, correct me if I'm wrong)? If this is how the program would flow, is there a more efficient method to achieve the DataTable parsing without having to reiterate the loop, but still being able to use backgroundworker? </p>\n\n<p>This is intended for a Windows Form, and the UI tends to freeze up when I parse the DataTable(s). I've heard that backgroundworker could help me get around the freezing of the UI, but I find it highly inefficient to have to re-parse the entire DataTable over, and over. However I'm not sure of any other way I can report progress without a for-loop either.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've figured out a temporary solution. It works, but I still have no way of reporting progress.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)\n    {\n        int rows = (int)e.Argument;\n        int count = 0;\n        t3 = runComparison();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= rows; i++)\n        {\n            count++;\n            int current = count / rows;\n            backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(current * 100);\n        }\n        e.Result = t3;\n    }\n\n    private void backgroundWorker1_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        progressBar1.Value = e.ProgressPercentage;\n    }\n\n    private void backgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (e.Error != null)\n        {\n            MessageBox.Show(\"An unexpected error has occurred.

However, the \"runComparison\" already consumes a lot of time. As such, progress doesn't get reported until an entire run-through if it's in the for-loop.

So far so good. </p>\n\n<p>Now I want the price labels to be updated when the product is updated. The Visual Studio interface helps me, and let me choose a 'Data Source Update Mode'. So I choose \"OnPropertyChanged\". </p>\n\n<p>Here comes the tricky part. How does the .NET runtime know that the price property is updated from the backend. So I modify my business class to implement INotifyPropertyChanged. Like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Product : INotifyPropertyChanged\n{\n    private double _price;\n\n    public double Price \n    { \n        get\n        {\n            return _price;\n        }\n        set\n        {\n            _price = value;\n            if (PropertyChanged != null)\n            {\n                PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(\"Price\"));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is this doesn't work. When I update a product it remeanes un-updated in the interface. When I debug and change the property, I see that the PropertyChanged event is null so no one is listening.</p>\n\n<p>Delving a little deeper in to the problem I found the following on the System.Windows.Forms.Binding Constructor page on MSDN:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An event named PropertyNameChanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I tried using a (custom) PriceChanged event, but that did not work.</p>\n\n<p>Am I doing something wrong here? I am comming from using WPF, so maybe this works a little different in Windows Forms? Is this because I am binding at runtime?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","winforms"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":0,"question_id":12876670,"title":"Panel disable ScrollControlIntoView while autoscroll=true","body":"<p>I have run into problems with using picturebox inside panel.

This feature prints the document to a Printer that is set up in the system as a Fax printer. Its a Brother, and the printer name is Brother PC-FAX. Currently, when the print job is initiated, the print driver opens a dialog box for inputting the fax number, cover sheet options, and what not. The fax number associated with the document is stored. I am trying to set up my app to inject the fax number for the user, and click the \"Start\" button.\nThe dialog has shortcuts, it initially focuses a button, and the user can press Shift+TAB to get to the number input control, which then accepts Ctrl+V to paste. Then the user can press Alt+O to activate the \"Start\" button. My previous app version simply copied the fax number to the clipboard, and left the paste and click actions to the user, but I'm trying to automate further. My current approach is</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hijack WndProc to answer the WM_ACTIVATE message</li>\n<li>If the Window caption is \"Brother PC-FAX\", then</li>\n<li>Use SendKeys.Send() to send \"+{TAB}\", \"^V\", and \"%O\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This would work, except when the actual fax dialog seems to not register as an actual window, as in, perhaps its just a dialog box child form of the print driver. The only window caption I come up with is the \"Printing\" box, which is the small window that pops up everytime you print, on any printer. This does not allow the SendKeys functions to pass through.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts as to how I should handle this?

The piece of code which I think is slowing it down is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Feed&lt;Video&gt; videoFeed = request.Get&lt;Video&gt;(query);\nint i = 0;\nforeach (Video entry in videoFeed.Entries)\n{\nstring[] info = printVideoEntry(entry).Split(',');\nWebClient wc = new WebClient();\nwc.DownloadFile(@\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/\" + info[0].ToString() + \"/hqdefault.jpg\", info[0].ToString() + \".jpg\");\n\nstring[] row1 = { \"\", info[0].ToString(), info[1].ToString() };\nListViewItem item = new ListViewItem(row1, i);\nYoutubeList.Items.Add(item);\n\nimageListSmall.Images.Add(Bitmap.FromFile(info[0].ToString() + @\".jpg\"));\nimageListLarge.Images.Add(Bitmap.FromFile(info[0].ToString() + @\".jpg\"));\n}\npublic static string printVideoEntry(Video video)\n{\n  return video.VideoId + \",\" + video.Title;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I use a Webclient which downloads the images so then I can use them as image in my listview. It works but what I'm concerned about is speed..any suggestions? maybe a different control all together?</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","winforms","reporting"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":929,"score":3,"question_id":3841347,"title":"Which .Net Reporting Tool?","body":"<p>I'm improving a software written in .net (3.5) and have decided to change its reports engine from crystal reports to something else.

I also generate the \"hexImgStr\" in another way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FileStream fs = new FileStream(imgPath,FileMode.Open);\nBinaryReader br=new BinaryReader(fs);\n//byte[] bytes=new byte[fs.Length];\nString hexImgStr=\"\";\nfor (long i = 0; i &lt; fs.Length; i++)\n{\n    //bytes[i] = br.ReadByte();\n    hexImgStr +=Convert.ToString(br.ReadByte(),16);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The image can't be seen either.

I'm attempting to make an application, using XNA as the base because of its renderer. One of the things that is necessary in this project is to open a new window (as a dialog), in which is embedded a separate XNA render panel. I'm using this as an interactive preview panel, so I absolutely need XNA to render in there. However, it seems XNA is not very well equipped to do this. I have tried various things myself, but to no avail (either producing errors and not rendering correctly, or rendering in the wrong aspect ratio, etc.). Normally, I would post code here, but since I have had such little luck, there isn't much to post.</p>\n\n<p>My application currently consists of an XNA application embedded within a Form, and I have a button to open the preview panel, which in theory should pop up as a Form Dialog, containing the XNA renderer, to allow me to draw the preview. I have been trying this for several hours, and got nowhere, so I'm asking for a bit of help here.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Okay, I've made a little progress, but I have 2 problems. Firstly, any textures drawn with a sprite batch appear the right dimensions, but filled with solid black. Also, when I open the dialog, and then close it, and close the application, I get an AccessViolationException. I strongly suspect the two errors are linked in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code initialising the preview dialog. (a is a custom class that essentially consists of a LinkedList of Texture2D objects).</p>\n\n<pre><code> animPrev = new AnimationPreview(a);\n animPrev.Show();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My AnimationPreview class is an extension of the Form class, and contains a PreviewControl object, which is an extension of the GraphicsDeviceControl found in the XNA Winforms sample. Note that my main form extends the XNA Game class, for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The PreviewControl object is set up like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  protected override void Initialize()\n     {\n        sb = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n        Application.Idle += delegate { Invalidate(); };\n     }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the Draw method contains:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void Draw()\n    {\n        GraphicsDevice.Clear(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.Color.Violet);\n        if (frame != null)\n        {\n            sb.Begin();\n            sb.Draw(Image, Vector2.Zero, Color.White);\n            sb.End();\n        }\n     }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This clears the background of the form violet, as expected, and draws a black box of the same size as Image. This is not expected. Hopefully someone can help me out here.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: An acceptable alternative would be to convert XNA Texture2D objects to System.Drawing.Image objects. However, I am using XNA 3.1, so I can't just save the texture to a stream and reload it.\nActually, after having tried this, it's a bit dodgy, and very slow, so I'd rather not do it this way.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","sql-server","winforms"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":70,"score":2,"question_id":12767862,"title":"Update records automatically between computers C #","body":"<p>I need help.

Even with the default five rows, though, tabbing from cell to cell and from row to row causes the first row (row 0) to disappear \"up and under\" the DGV when I get to the last (5th) row / row 4.</p>\n\n<p>I want the 5 (or however many) rows to always stay in the same spot, rather than to move based on where the cursor is.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know why this is the default behavior in this scenario, and am curious about that, but mostly just need to know how to prevent this bizarreness.</p>\n\n<p>When users add additional rows, I calculate the heights of each row like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dataGridViewPlatypi.Rows.Add();\nint newRowHeight = dataGridViewPlatypi.Height / dataGridViewPlatypi.RowCount;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; dataGridViewPlatypi.RowCount; i++)\n{\n    dataGridViewPlatypi.Rows[i].Height = newRowHeight;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...this inexact math can lead to some \"extra space\" at the bottom of the grid when the division has a remainder/modulo, such as: When there are six rows, the height of each row is 26 and leaves 4 pixels over on the bottom of the grid -- but again, this unnerving behavior even occurs when the default 5 rows are ensconced in the 160 pixel-high DGV (32 pixels per row).</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if I need to set some property or write some code for the DGV, a row, a cell, or...???</p>\n\n<h2>UPDATE</h2>\n\n<p>I've found that if I add 2 to the DGV's height at design time (162 instead of 160, so that each row is 32 and there are 2 pixels \"for the DGV\" left over, it works with the default 5 rows.</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, trying to get it to adjust when the user adds additional rows is proving problematic.

I just have to go to Debug | Exceptions and make sure that both columns of checkboxes are checked.  I then run the application and if any exceptions then I get dropped straight into the offending piece of code.</p>\n\n<p>How do I determine exceptions during testing, when I give test build to a tester.  I do not want the tester to run within Visual Studio, just as a regular user.  I still want to know if there are exceptions and the pertinent details.</p>\n\n<p>Obviosualy, I should be able to control the process, so that when the code gets released normal execution happens.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I know about and use try/catch blocks, but I am talking about a method similar to Visual Studio exception catcher and reporter, just possibly compiled into the product and used for deployment to beta testers.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Visual Studio has such a feature, in which case where and how to set up, or possibly a third party component.</p>\n\n<p>[Update:\nI added two sub-questions, which you can find at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12731065/unhandled-exception-next-line-or-exit\">Unhandled Exception next line or exit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The solution mentioned below sounds great and with a tweak probably works, just not at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the Visual Studio both 2010 and now 2012 works great. The exception handler gets called, okay after VS breaks at the line and I say to continue. I decided to test outside the VS2012 IDE, good thing for that. The OS traps the bug, shows the standard an \"An Unhandled Exception Occurred\" dialog giving the details along with a continue and quit buttons. Selecting continue, just continues the application with no trapping into my uber exception handler. Selecting quite, whites-out the application and displays the standard close window dialog. The quit button also does not call my uber handler.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose is so that my exception handler gets called. I do not need an uber exception handler if I am working inside the VS2012 IDE. The purpose of the handler is for end users and beta testers, namely anyone other than myself and who will not have my development station.</p>\n\n<p>So unless I am missing something, the question is still open.</p>\n\n<p>There are code samples in the other question, enough to copy and paste and create a test application in a couple minutes time.\n]</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n\n<p>Sarah</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","resize","panel","groupbox"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":12735735,"title":"How can I get the panel's children to dynamically reset their Location.Y property?","body":"<p>I have a panel on a form, with the panel's AutoScroll property set to True.</p>\n\n<p>On that panel I have placed several GroupBox controls, which take up more space than the panel does - thus, the panel sprouts a vertical scroll bar.</p>\n\n<p>One of the panels can change height at runtime if need be (I programmatically set its height based on the amount of text it contains):</p>\n\n<pre><code>groupBox1.Height = label1.Height + label1.Top + 10;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine if the panel increases in height - the GroupBoxes below it \"move down.\" However, if the panel decreases in height, the GroupBoxes below do not \"move up.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know I can move the groupbox controls that are below upwards programmatically, but I'm thinking there must be a better/less fussy way of doing it than that...</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","drag-and-drop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12647442,"title":"DragDrop registration did not succeed exception","body":"<p>I launch a dialog from out of proc COM server, the dialog has some drag drop ctrl operations within it.

The downfalls I'm having is the WPF window is in a Class Library, which does not have an App.xaml, and the benefits that go with it. Also, our server communication, error handling, display of error dialogs and other prompts is built into the framework of our WinForm App, so we are using a CallBack interface to use these functions from the WPF window. The most notable drawback is when launching dialogs/prompts because the WinForm dialog cannot parent to a WPF window.

The SplitContainer's right-hand 'Panel2' will host Panels that are added as items are added to the Listbox. So, if the design-time user adds the first item to the Listbox, an associated Panel is added to the SplitContainer's 'Panel2'. If a 2nd item is added to the Listbox, a 2nd Panel is added to the SplitContainer's 'Panel2'. Then, as the user selects Listbox items, the associated Panel is displayed on the right.</p>\n\n<p>The problem comes at design-time, when the user drags-and-drops a control (e.g. a Button) from the toolbox onto the currently active right-hand Panel (the Panel corresponding to the currently selected Listbox item). I programatically add it to the appropriate Panel's Controls collection, but this results in a <strong>\"'child' is not a child control of this parent\" error</strong> within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.</p>\n\n<p>I've researched the problem and discovered some useful articles showing \"how to allow a Control, which is a child of another Control to accept having controls dropped onto it at design time\", e.g.: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37830/Designing-Nested-Controls\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37830/Designing-Nested-Controls</a></p>\n\n<p>This uses the \"DesignerSerializationVisibility\" attribute in combination with ControlDesigner's \"EnableDesignMode\" method, to allow the VS IDE to handle the dropping of controls onto another control. The problem is that in this scenario, the UserControl's target hosting Control is effectively fixed and known up-front. <strong>With my control, the target hosting Panel which can have other controls dropped onto it at design-time, is not known up-front, since my UserControl itself can be built 'on-the-fly' (as users add more Listbox items resulting in more potential hosting Panels).</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've tried using the \"DesignerSerializationVisibility\" and \"EnableDesignMode\" method in a more flexible way, but still seem to run into the aforementioned 'child is not a child control of this parent' error.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this all makes sense!? The code currently looks something like this:</p>\n\n<p>This is within the ListboxPanelControl Class:\n...</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [\n    Category(\"Appearance\"),\n    DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content)\n    ]\n    public Panel MainPanel\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            //Instead of returning a 'fixed' Panel we return whatever the currently\n            //active Panel is according to the currently selected Listbox item\n            if( mnCurrentlyActiveListBoxIndex &gt;= 0 )\n            {\n                ListBoxEntry lEntry = (ListBoxEntry)listBox.Items[mnCurrentlyActiveListBoxIndex];\n                return lEntry.RelatedPanel;\n            }\n\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, in the \"OnControlAdded\" event in the ListBoxPanelControl, I call \"EnableDesignMode\" (via a simple \"SetDesignMode\" wrapper) for the currently-active Panel, and then add the control:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override void OnControlAdded(ControlEventArgs e)\n{\n...\nmDesigner.SetDesignMode(MainPanel, \"MainPanel\" + mnCurrentlyActiveListBoxIndex.ToString());\n                    ListBoxEntry lEntry = (ListBoxEntry)listBox.Items[mnCurrentlyActiveListBoxIndex];\n                    lEntry.RelatedPanel.Controls.Add(e.Control);\n                    e.Control.BringToFront();\n                    e.Control.Refresh();\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope I've explained the issue clearly enough!

Here is the code:</p>\n\n<p>Here is the email method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//method to send email to outlook\npublic void sendEMailThroughOUTLOOK(string recipient, \n    string subject, string body)\n{        \n    try\n    {    \n        // Create the Outlook application.\n        Outlook.Application oApp = new Outlook.Application();\n        // Create a new mail item.\n        Outlook.MailItem oMsg = \n            (Outlook.MailItem)oApp.CreateItem(Outlook.OlItemType.olMailItem);\n        // Set HTMLBody. \n        //add the body of the email\n        oMsg.Body = body;\n\n        oMsg.Subject = subject;\n        // Add a recipient.\n        Outlook.Recipients oRecips = (Outlook.Recipients)oMsg.Recipients;\n        // Change the recipient in the next line if necessary.\n        Outlook.Recipient oRecip = (Outlook.Recipient)oRecips.Add(recipient);\n        oRecip.Resolve();\n        // Send.\n        oMsg.Send();\n        // Clean up.\n        oRecip = null;\n        oRecips = null;\n        oMsg = null;\n        oApp = null;\n    }//end of try block\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n    } //end of catch\n} //end of Email Method\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is the timer event:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)\n{\n    foreach (rowClass row in this.rows)\n    {\n        string recipientAddress = \"roomcheckstest@gmail.com\";\n        string subjectLine = \"GPC \" + (string)row.buildingComboBox.SelectedItem\n            + \" \" + (string)row.roomComboBox.SelectedItem + \"-Room Check\";\n        string senderline = \"Sender=ctsstaff.ithelpcentral@ttu.edu\" + \"\\t\";\n        string newlinespaces = Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine +\n            Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine;\n        string legalLastName = \"Legal Last Name=\" + \n            (string)row.buildingComboBox.SelectedItem;\n        string legalFirstName = \"Legal First Name=\" + \n            (string)row.roomComboBox.SelectedItem;\n        string timeLine = \"Time= 15m\";\n        string requestType = \"Initial Request Type=Onsite\";\n        string classRoomMaintenace = \"Classroom maintenance. \" +\n            \"Regular Classroom weekly check.\";\n        string closingEmailSent = \"Closing Email Sent=yes\";\n        string currentlyClosed = \"Currently Closed=yes\";\n        string assignTo = \"Assign To=ITHC CTS Staff\";\n        string typeLine = \"Type=Hardware\";\n        string category = \"Category=Internal Component\";\n        string subCategory = \"Subcategory=Performance\";\n        string agentType = \"Type (Agent)=Hardware\";\n        string agentCategory = \"Type (Agent)=Hardware\";\n        string subCategoryAgent = \"Subcategory (Agent)=Performance\";\n        string labelLine = \"Label=Service Request\";\n        string status = \"Status=Closed\";\n        string finalbody = senderline + newlinespaces + legalLastName \n            + newlinespaces + legalFirstName + newlinespaces + timeLine \n            + newlinespaces + requestType + newlinespaces + classRoomMaintenace \n            + newlinespaces + closingEmailSent + newlinespaces \n            + currentlyClosed + newlinespaces + assignTo + newlinespaces \n            + typeLine + newlinespaces + category + newlinespaces \n            + subCategory + newlinespaces + agentType + newlinespaces \n            + agentCategory + newlinespaces + subCategoryAgent \n            + newlinespaces + labelLine + newlinespaces + status;\n        sendEMailThroughOUTLOOK(recipientAddress, subjectLine, finalbody);\n        MessageBox.Show(\"email\");\n        //Thread.Sleep(60000);\n        //sendEMailThroughOUTLOOK(recipientAddress, subjectLine, finalbody);\n    }       \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is where the timer is created inside a send email button on the form, which should in theory call the email method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void submitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    if (rows[0].buildingComboBox.SelectedIndex &gt; -1)\n    {\n        System.Timers.Timer time = new System.Timers.Timer();\n        time.Interval = 300000;\n        time.Enabled = true;\n        time.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);\n\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Issues Sent\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I send an email for each row of components on the form (the user adds rows as needed)\nThe email is sent through outlook (it has to be sent through outlook using exchange server)\nI need to delay it because the server will not accept them all at once. My understanding of the timer class must be flawed.

I get the famous error \"unable to relay for xxx@yyy.zzz\". What's mysterious to me is that when I cut and paste the exact same code that sends the e-mail into an usual .NET Windows Forms application, send the e-mail with this application, it all works just fine. This made me think that perhaps the problem is that the ASP.NET application runs as NETWORK SERVICE while the Windows Forms application runs on a domain user account, but it turns out that I have another ASP.NET application sending e-mail through the same SMTP-server running under NETWORK SERVER at the same IIS, and this application does not experience this problem. </p>\n\n<p>I've further tried to send e-mails through the SMTP-server manually by telnet the SMTP-server on port 25 and running the SMTP-protocol manually, and it all works fine. The SMTP-server is not configured with any kind of authentication or SSL. </p>\n\n<p>Another mysterious fact is that the ASP.NET application can send e-mails from an address within the same domain to an e-mail address within the same domain, but not to any address outside of the domain.

Everything else explicitly checked for is allowed (Home, PageUp, PageDown, etc.) - it's just the \".\" character that is being barred entry.</p>\n\n<h2>UPDATE 3</h2>\n\n<p>Using the second approach above and replacing \"Keys.Decimal\" with \"Keys.OemPeriod\" works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected override bool ProcessCmdKey(ref Message msg, Keys keyData)\n{\n    Keys keycode = keyData &amp; ~Keys.Modifiers;\n\n    bool isDigit = keycode &gt;= Keys.D0 &amp;&amp; keycode &lt;= Keys.D9 ||\n                   keycode &gt;= Keys.NumPad0 &amp;&amp; keycode &lt;= Keys.NumPad9;\n    bool isControl = (keyData &amp; Keys.Modifiers) != Keys.None;\n\n    if (isDigit ||\n        isControl ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Up) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Down) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Left) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Right) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Home) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Tab) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.PageDown) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.PageUp) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Space) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.Back) ||\n        (keyData == Keys.OemPeriod))\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","winforms"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":446,"score":1,"question_id":9722519,"title":"Why i have vertical scrollbar in tablelayoutpanel","body":"<p>I'm trying to create a buttons dynamically and add them to table layout panel the problems is that no matter what i do i keep having a vertical scrollbar  even if i have only one row of buttons.\nCode : </p>\n\n<pre><code> private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)\n        {\n            Button button = new Button();\n         //   button.Location = new Point(20, 30 * i + 10);\n        button.Click += new EventHandler(ButtonClick);\n        this.tableLayoutPanel1.ColumnStyles.Add(new System.Windows.Forms.ColumnStyle(System.Windows.Forms.SizeType.Absolute, 20F));\n        tableLayoutPanel1.ColumnCount += 1;\n        tableLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(button);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result : \n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KZNzs.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I want to get rid of it the horizontal one is ok</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","windows-forms-designer"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":0,"question_id":12609609,"title":"Centering Windows Forms Controls inside TableLayoutPanel with Visual Studio Designer","body":"<p>I have control containers tightly bound to the edge of user controls, evenly spaced on both sides of said user control (child controls are always centered within the parent).

I had a thought of this, but Writeable bitmap does not offer method such as FillEllipse() to place markers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nusing Microsoft.Kinect;\nusing System.Drawing.Imaging;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n\nnamespace fTrack_WF\n{\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n\n        KinectSensor myKinect;\n\n        private void Window_Loaded(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (KinectSensor.KinectSensors.Count == 0)\n            {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"No Kinects device detected\", \"Camera View\");\n                Application.Exit();\n                return;\n            }\n\n            try\n            {\n                // get first Kinect device attached on computer\n                myKinect = KinectSensor.KinectSensors[0];\n\n                // enable depth stream\n                myKinect.DepthStream.Enable();\n\n                // enable color video stream\n                myKinect.ColorStream.Enable();\n\n                // start the sensor\n                myKinect.Start();\n\n\n                // connect up the video event handler\n                myKinect.ColorFrameReady += new EventHandler&lt;ColorImageFrameReadyEventArgs&gt;(myKinect_ColorFrameReady);\n\n            }\n            catch\n            {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"Kinect initialise failed\", \"Camera viewer\");\n                Application.Exit();\n            }\n\n\n        }\n\n\n        #region Video Image Processing\n\n        byte[] colorData = null;\n        Bitmap kinectVideoBitmap = null;\n        IntPtr colorPtr;\n\n        void myKinect_ColorFrameReady(object sender, ColorImageFrameReadyEventArgs e)\n        {\n            using (ColorImageFrame colorFrame = e.OpenColorImageFrame())\n            {\n                if (colorFrame == null) return;\n\n                if (colorData == null)\n                    colorData = new byte[colorFrame.PixelDataLength];\n\n                colorFrame.CopyPixelDataTo(colorData);\n\n                Marshal.FreeHGlobal(colorPtr);\n                colorPtr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(colorData.Length);\n                Marshal.Copy(colorData, 0, colorPtr, colorData.Length);\n\n                kinectVideoBitmap = new Bitmap(\n                    colorFrame.Width,\n                    colorFrame.Height,\n                    colorFrame.Width * colorFrame.BytesPerPixel;\n                    PixelFormat.Format32bppRgb,\n                    colorPtr);\n\n                kinectVideoBox.Image = kinectVideoBitmap;\n\n                kinectVideoBitmap.Dispose();\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        #endregion\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\n\n<p>Regards,\nikel</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms",".net-2.0"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":7292,"score":1,"question_id":3965043,"title":"How to open a new form from another form","body":"<p>I have form which is opened using ShowDialog Method.

My image is roughly 1000x1000 pixels and my box is something arbitrary like 400x500, so, for example, when I click the mouse I'd want the image to move 50 to the left.
