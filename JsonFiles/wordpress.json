On further investigation, I changed a bit of my code towards the end from hidden to text. This reveals an input field that is usually automatically filled with the post type \"post\".

I'd like to retroactively introduce custom post types and taxonomies.</p>\n\n<p>I have a very elaborate (and difficult to use) categorization scheme that should make this easy to do if I could just mass convert posts under a given category to a custom post types or custom taxonomy. (This is because different content types get their own categories [article, video,] as do different taxonomy types [people, places])</p>\n\n<p>I've already created the custom post types and taxonomies that I need using the plugin custom post type ui.</p>\n\n<p>The first step, changing the post type of certain posts, is easy to do by using the convert post types plugin. (It allows you to change the post type of posts under any category, which fits my needs perfectly.)</p>\n\n<p>The second step, converting certain categories to custom taxonomies (say, a set of categories about politicians to a \"politicians\" custom taxonomy family) is proving to be bloody impossible. There doesn't seem to be a category to custom taxonomy converter plugin out there (the way there is for custom post type conversion,) despite the obvious need for one by anybody looking to to apply WP3.0's CMSing innovations to an already existing blog.</p>\n\n<p>So I've tried going the manual route. If I manually change the \"taxonomy\" field of different terms in the wp_term_taxonomy table - say, from category to politicians, a custom taxonomy - all posts under that (former) category reflect the update. If you try to edit a post, the custom taxonomy meta-boxes display the right term. (I haven't tried writing a custom loop to see if the posts would display on the site, so I don't know if that works, but I assume it does.) So far, so good. OR SO IT WOULD SEEM:</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>first problem</strong> is that if you go to the custom taxonomy page (the equivalent of the \"category\" or \"post tags\" page under posts,) none of the terms show up in the table at the right. If you SEARCH for them, though, they do show up. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what a skilled WP developer told me when I brought this up: </p>\n\n<p>\"I think the problem with updating the db manually is that the post cache doesn’t get changed. (See update_post_caches().) I need to make sure I’m doing that when I change the post types, too.\"</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure what that means or what to do with that.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>second problem</strong> is that creating a custom taxonomy and associating it with posts (or any custom post type) doesn't generate a filter box on the view posts page, the way it does for categories. This makes custom taxonomies almost unusable, at least in my case.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anybody have ideas on how to convert categories to custom taxonomies (or at least how to get them to display in the backend if you convert them manually) and how to add a taxonomy filter on the posts page?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","ajax","wordpress","jquery-ajax","curl"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":87,"score":3,"question_id":12959923,"title":"PHP/Curl/Wordpress Posting data without refreshing page, curl not working","body":"<p>I am writing code for a donation page and want to submit CC information without refreshing the page, and display the results using an overlay.

Any help would be appreciated. Here's a link to another thread ( <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7390553/need-to-insert-javascript-into-php-code-wordpress-website?rq=1\">Need to insert javascript into php code [Wordpress Website]</a> ) where someone offered assistance for doing this with the Twenty Ten theme, but being that I'm on Twenty Twelve, it looks like I'll need something different (or maybe a simple adaptation of it may work?).

Everything works if I switch back to the default setting, but, for SEO, I would rather use the permalinks option.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my htaccess file (it is on my WP installation folder):</p>\n\n<pre><code># BEGIN WordPress\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /mysite/\nRewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule . /mysite/index.php [L]\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\n# END WordPress\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have seen this post <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2157279/wordpress-htaccess-with-permalinks\">wordpress .htaccess with permalinks</a> but nothing there could help me. Any help would be very nice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong> Things I have tried already:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delete pages and create again.</li>\n<li>Access the permalink field on wp_options (db) and setting the value to blank and set the permalink option in the admin again.</li>\n<li>I´m running it on windows 7 through an apache2 installation of Zend Server.</li>\n<li>I thought it was a problem related to my localhost environment, so I put the site online. No luck at all. I'm assuming that wordpress can´t change permalinks to a more friendly url type when you set a static front page. What a shame.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","facebook-graph-api"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13214339,"title":"PHP Facebook Cronjob with offline access","body":"<p>how can make this work </p>\n\n<p>1:the code to greet the user, ask for his permission and store his session data so that we can use a cronjob with his session data afterwards.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php  $db_server = \"localhost\";   \n$db_username = \"username\";   \n$db_password = \"password\";   \n$db_name = \"databasename\";   \n#go to line 85, the script actually starts there   \nmysql_connect($db_server,$db_username,$db_password);   \nmysql_select_db($db_name);   \n#you have to create a database to store session values.  \n#if you do not know what columns there should be look at line 76 to see column names.   \n#make them all varchars   \n# Now lets load the FB GRAPH API  \n require './facebook.php';   \n// Create our Application instance.   \nglobal $facebook;   \n$facebook = new Facebook(array(  'appId'  =&gt; '121036530138',\n'secret' =&gt; '9bbec378147064',\n'cookie' =&gt; false,));\n\n# Lets set up the permissions we need and set the login url in case we need it.\n\n$par['req_perms'] = \"friends_about_me,friends_education_history,friends_likes, friends_interests,friends_location,friends_religion_politics, friends_work_history,publish_stream,friends_activities, friends_events, friends_hometown,friends_location ,user_interests,user_likes,user_events,      user_about_me,user_status,user_work_history,read_requests, read_stream,offline_access,user_religion_politics,email,user_groups\";\n\n$loginUrl = $facebook-&gt;getLoginUrl($par);\n\nfunction save_session($session){\nglobal $facebook;\n # OK lets go to the database and see if we have a session stored\n$sid=mysql_query(\"Select access_token from facebook_user WHERE uid =\".$session['uid']);     $session_id=mysql_fetch_row($sid);\nif (is_array($session_id)) {\n        # We have a stored session, but is it valid?\n    echo \"\nWe have a session, but is it valid?\";\n    try {\n        $attachment =  array('access_token' =&gt; $session_id[0]);\n        $ret_code=$facebook-&gt;api('/me', 'GET', $attachment);\n        }\n        catch (Exception $e) {\n            # We don't have a good session so\n            echo \"\nour old session is not valid, let's delete saved invalid session data\n\n\";\n            $res = mysql_query(\"delete from facebook_user WHERE uid =\".$session['uid']);\n                 #save new good session\n            #to see what is our session data: print_r($session);\n            if (is_array($session)) {\n                    $sql=\"insert into facebook_user (session_key,uid,expires,secret,access_token,sig)\n                                          VALUES ('\".$session['session_key'].\"','\".$session['uid'].\"','\". $session['expires'].\"','\".\n                                          $session['secret'] .\"','\" . $session['access_token'].\"','\". $session['sig'].\"');\";\n\n                        $res = mysql_query($sql);\n\n                       return $session['access_token'];\n            }\n            # this should never ever happen\n            echo \"\nSomething is terribly wrong: Our old session was bad,\n                                      and now we cannot get the new session\";\n            return;\n }\n        echo \"\nOur old stored session is valid\n\n\";\n        return $session_id[0];\n    }\nelse    {\n    echo \"\nno stored session, this means the user never subscribed to our application before.\n\n\";\n        # let's store the session\n        $session = $facebook-&gt;getSession();\n        if (is_array($session)) {\n            # Yes we have a session!

Such as <a href=\"http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/</a></p>\n\n<p>I switched permalinks to default (numeric).

I've refreshed a dozen times, restarted the server, checked and double checked .htaccess to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>Again, all of this was working perfectly until a couple of weeks ago so really not sure what happened. Is there something I can debug or try? I've tried WP_DEBUG but for some reason the debug.log file is never created so not sure what's going on there.

The contact form in question is a normal contact inquiry form, so I need to retain the usual functionality (mailing the data).  However I also have a checkbox on the form that allows the sender to choose whether to subscribe to the client's mailing list in addition to mailing the contact inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>The client uses Bronto for their mass mailing (similar to CC or Mailchimp).  Bronto has a \"direct add\" feature (<a href=\"http://community.bronto.com/blog/how-to/adding-contacts-direct-add\" rel=\"nofollow\">more info here</a>) that allows you to send parameters to add contacts to the Bronto account by embedding an image whose url contains the requisite parameters (email address, list to subscribe to, etc).</p>\n\n<p>I can construct the image url with the contact form parameters no problem, but actually getting the image request sent is a different matter.  I am over my head both in PHP and JS here and not sure what course to take.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm using the <code>wpcf7_before_send_mail</code> php hook built into CF7 and this appears to allow me to collect the form data and build the URL.  However, since the plugin uses AJAX and doesn't actually redirect to another page on form submission it seems I can't successfully use any kind of php output (echo, alert, even error_log), presumably because the server doesn't know what it's supposed to write to.</p>\n\n<p>In functions.php:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action( 'wpcf7_before_send_mail', 'bronto_contact_add' );\nfunction bronto_contact_add( $cf7 ) {\n    $emailcf = $cf7-&gt;posted_data['email'];\n    echo $emailcf;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is just a test to see if echo works - it does not.  Instead the form just hangs on submission and I see the rotating loading gif forever.</p>\n\n<p>What I need to do is build the image url using parameters from the cf7 object (which I can do no problem) and then somehow send that image request to the Bronto server (this is the part I am confused about).  If this was a normal form that redirected to another php page upon submission I would have no problem doing this at all, but it uses AJAX which I don't know much about so I'm pretty lost now.</p>\n\n<p>Can anybody help shed some light on how the best way to accomplish this might be?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","widget","switch-statement"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":18,"score":1,"question_id":13179162,"title":"Wordpress widget constantly switching","body":"<p>I work as a Webmaster at a Canadian company named Atrium Innovations.

My site is running the latest version of Wordpress (3.4.2).</p>\n\n<p>The ideal system would work like this:</p>\n\n<p>The user fills out a form with information about the paper (format, structure, etc.). The user then copy and pastes their paper into a textarea that counts the number of words and displays a total in a read-only input box below. Everything up to this point is definitely doable. Where I'm running into trouble is having the calculation then affect the total price of the service (charging by word, depending on the number of days selected until the paper is due). Again, I can write a script to do all this and calculate the total price, but I don't know how to send the form information to the database and then enter the total price into a custom Paypal field in order to use Paypal to charge the user.</p>\n\n<p>I have thought about doing this a few different ways but am open to suggestions. One is to accept the user information on one screen and after submitting it to the database, having a second screen that imports the word count price calculation into the Paypal custom field.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea (ideally) would be to send the form to two places, both the database as well as to Paypal so that it would take less clicks for a user to submit and purchase the service.</p>\n\n<p>A final idea I had was to use an altered shopping cart plugin like WP-Ecommerce and create some kind of custom field that would help in calculating all of this, but unfortunately, try as I might, I haven't been able to figure out how to make it work as it should.</p>\n\n<p>Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

The project admin is able to upload a csv file from the WP admin interface.  On the client side, when the file is uploaded it goes through each line of the file, extracts the necessary info about the users and then makes an AJAX call to add the participant to the project.  I decided to parse the csv file on the client side and submit the ajax requests one by one so that I could update a progress bar as each returns. The javascript looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$( '#csv_upload_button' ).click( function() {\n    // declare the necessary variables\n    var f = $( '#csv_file_input' )[0].files[0],\n        fr = new FileReader,\n        rows, headers, dialog, count, remaining;\n    // when the file loads\n    fr.onload = function() {\n        // get the rows, the count, number remaining to process, and headers\n        rows = fr.result.split( \"\\n\" );\n        remaining = count = rows.length - 1; // -1 to account for header row\n        headers = $.trim( rows[0] ).split( ',' );\n        // create the dialog box to show the progress bar\n        dialog = $( '&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' )\n                    .html( \n                        '&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;p&gt;&lt;progress id=\"csv_upload_progress\" max=\"' + count + \n                        '\" min=\"0\" value=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' )\n                    .dialog( { modal: true; } );\n        // then for each row in the file\n        $( rows ).each( function( i, r ) {\n            // create an object to hold the data\n            var data = {}, row = $.trim( r ).split( ',' ), j;\n            if ( i &gt; 0 ) { // data starts on the second row\n                // map the data into our object\n                for ( j = 0; j &lt; headers.length; j++ ) {\n                    data[ headers[ j ] ] = row[ j ];\n                }\n                // send it to the server\n                $.post(\n                    ajaxurl, \n                    { \n                        action: 'import_panel_member', \n                        data: data, \n                        postid: $( '#post_ID' ).val() \n                    }, \n                    function( result ) {\n                        var prog = $( '#csv_upload_progress' );\n                        prog.attr( 'value', prog.attr( 'value' ) + 1 );\n                        if ( 0 == --remaining ) {\n                            // stuff to do when everything has been loaded\n                        }\n                    }\n                );\n            }\n        });\n    };\n    // read the csv file\n    fr.readAsText( f );\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The PHP looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>function import_panel_member() {\n    header( 'content-type: application/json' );\n    // get the variables sent from the client\n    $postid = $_POST[ 'postid' ];\n    $data   = $_POST[ 'data'   ];\n    /*\n     * ...do other things involving talking to a 3rd party server...\n     */\n    // get the WP meta data variable to be updated\n    $participants = get_post_meta( $postid, '_project_participants', true );\n    // modify it\n    $participants[] = $data;\n    // update the database\n    update_post_meta( $postid, '_project_participants', $participants );\n    // return a message to the client\n    echo json_encode( (object) array( 'success' =&gt; 1, 'message' =&gt; 'added' ) );\n    exit;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that since these requests happen asynchronously, it appears that the <code>_project_participants</code> metadata field is only being updated by the last record to be processed.  In other words, only the last person in the list shows up in the list of participants.  Here are some things that I've tried:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change <code>$.post()</code> to <code>$.ajax()</code> and set <code>async: false</code></strong><br>\nThis works but it's much slower (due to synchronous calls) and for some reason it prevents my dialog box from showing up until after all the ajax calls have finished.</li>\n<li><strong>Upload the entire csv file to the server and deal with it there</strong><br>\nInstead of parsing the csv on the client side.  This works, too, but I don't think I can get intermediate feedback from the server that I can use to update the progress bar.  This request can take quite a while, and I don't want users to \"give up\" on the request before it's complete. When doing it this way, sometimes the server never responds to the ajax call.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So perhaps I am greedy and just want my cake and to eat it, too.  How can I take advantage of the speed of asynchronous requests, which give me the opportunity to give the user feedback with a progress bar, but not screw myself up with concurrency issues on the server?</p>\n"}]}

C doesn't - I need it to be different in the CSS lebel.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I would like to have a <code>has-children</code> class in A and B, but not in C.</p>\n\n<p>So far I've managed to create a \"Menu Walker\" PHP class that I can instantiate and pass to <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu\" rel=\"nofollow\">wp_nav_menu</a> . Its constructor looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class My_Walker_Nav_Menu extends Walker_Nav_Menu {\n  function start_el(&amp;$output, $item, $depth, $args) {\n    ...\n    if(??? $item has children???) {\n      // I know what to do here\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, how do I tell whether <code>$item</code> has children, or is a leaf?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: this question was answered by someone called \"keesiemeijer\" in the Wordpress forums.

I made plenty use of custom post types and custom taxonomies. Last but not least I made it multilingual using WPML plugin.</p>\n\n<p>During CPT declarations I wrapped strings and slugs in <code>gettext</code> in order to have them translation-ready within WPML.</p>\n\n<p>An example of CPT declaration is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>register_post_type('rooms',\n    array(\n        'label' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n        'description' =&gt; __('','valletta'),\n        'public' =&gt; true,\n        'show_ui' =&gt; true,\n        'show_in_menu' =&gt; true,\n        'capability_type' =&gt; 'post',\n        'hierarchical' =&gt; true,\n        'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; __('rooms','valletta')),\n        'query_var' =&gt; true,\n        'exclude_from_search' =&gt; false,\n        'menu_position' =&gt; 25,\n        'supports' =&gt; array('title','editor','excerpt','custom-fields','comments',),\n        'taxonomies' =&gt; array('features','typology',),\n        'labels' =&gt; array (\n            'name' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n            'singular_name' =&gt; __('room','valletta'),\n            'menu_name' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n            'add_new' =&gt; __('Add room','valletta'),\n            'add_new_item' =&gt; __('Add New room','valletta'),\n            'edit' =&gt; __('Edit','valletta'),\n            'edit_item' =&gt; __('Edit room','valletta'),\n            'new_item' =&gt; __('New room','valletta'),\n            'view' =&gt; __('View room','valletta'),\n            'view_item' =&gt; __('View room','valletta'),\n            'search_items' =&gt; __('Search Rooms','valletta'),\n            'not_found' =&gt; __('No Rooms Found','valletta'),\n            'not_found_in_trash' =&gt; __('No Rooms Found in Trash','valletta'),\n            'parent' =&gt; __('Parent room','valletta'),\n        )\n    )\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I wrapped the slug term too and this (to me) make perfectly sense. What I wanted to achive was that when a user visits the \"standard\" website in Italian would reach a room CPT page via /camere/nome-camera/ while the English user would get it by /rooms/room-name/. This works smoothly for Italian language and WPML correctly translate slug for the English version too so if I'm viewing a room CPT in the Italian website and I switch to the English version, WordPress is taken to /rooms/ with the only problem that it shows a 404.</p>\n\n<p>I checked WPML website and they admit that slugs translation is still a work in progress and is a functionality that will problably released with next version of the plugin. Ok, that's fine.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to achive then is an hack to use while WPML updates is plugin. My idea is to have some few custom rewrite rules in my .htaccess and have a URL rewrite of those CPT pages. I thought that I could remove slug translation in order to have a single slug for both languages and then have a rewrite rule that when someone types the translated slug gets instead the \"standard\" one but at least the content is correct and: a) the user won't notice anything since the browser wont't redirect the page but just rewrite the URL and b) nothing changes for WP (or it does??).</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: how can I do all this? Removing slug translation is fine, just a delete on the WPML backend but I'm not very comfortable with rewrite rules and the like so I'm looking for someone to help me reach my goal and, eventually, show a better way to achieve what I need (and naturally have a feedback if my idea makes sense or not).</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I missed something.

How can I break the loop, and add the <code>.wrap</code> div only once and then continue the loop?</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ($wp_query-&gt;have_posts()) :\n\n    $wp_query-&gt;the_post(); \n    if($wp_query-&gt;current_post &lt;= 1){ ?&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"x\"&gt;\n        .. post 1\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;?php }\n    if($wp_query-&gt;current_post &gt; 1){ ?&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"wrap\"&gt; &lt;!-- should be only once --&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"y\"&gt;\n            .. post 2\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;div class=\"y\"&gt;\n            .. post 3\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- should be only once --&gt;\n    &lt;?php } ?&gt;\n\nendwhile;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["html","wordpress","twitter-bootstrap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13121835,"title":"div position is not fixed in different screen sizes","body":"<p>i m using tweeter bootstrap for my wordpres site.my problem is that i just made a div as right side bar and place some images onto it.it seems good on my desktop but when i see it on my laptop it change its position and goes downwards.please help me with this.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code for div and image placements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div style=\"position:fixed; top:188px; right:0px; border:0px solid #f00; width:25px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/delhi.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/noida.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jaipur.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chennai.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","wordpress","if-statement","insert","sql-update"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13121935,"title":"Update / Insert Statements","body":"<p>hi i have to do insert / update information form one external database to the wordpress database (Mysql 5.1).\ni have read a lot of statements about if exists do... but i don't get it...\ni tried to do it this way: </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT IF(\n          EXISTS\n             (SELECT *\n                FROM wp_MM_usermeta a, wp_mm_corum_user_import\n               WHERE     a.user_id =\n                            wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                     AND user_ID = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                     AND wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                            IS NOT NULL),\n          (UPDATE wp_MM_usermeta, wp_mm_corum_user_import\n   SET meta_value = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_PER::Nachname`\n WHERE     wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress` IS NOT NULL\n       AND user_id = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n       AND wp_MM_usermeta.meta_key LIKE 'last_name'), \n       (INSERT INTO wp_MM_usermeta(meta_key, user_id, meta_value)\nVALUES (\n          (SELECT distinct 'last_name',\n                  user_id,\n                  wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_PER::Nachname`\n             FROM wp_mm_corum_user_import, wp_MM_usermeta\n            WHERE     user_id = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n\n                  AND wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress` IS NOT NULL\n                  ))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but i can't do a insert / update statement during the select ...\nhow can i do this updates / Insert in a performant way?\nthx for any advice!</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","wordpress","slider"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13122055,"title":"jquery slider with specific link for each region","body":"<p>I have searched for something like this but without success..\n<a href=\"http://www.lifestylemirror.com/latest_cover/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lifestylemirror.com/latest_cover/</a>\nsomeone know where can I get one of this?

I just want to know if there is anyother way I can add the theme to my JSP pages.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":23,"score":0,"question_id":13108280,"title":"Show Meta Description As Post Excerpts in Wordpress","body":"<p>I want to show Meta Description instead of post excerpts below the post title in my Wordpress blog's Loop pages(Main pagae, Category Pages, Tage Pages).</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Yoast Wordpress Seo Plugin and found the below code working in one of my blogs that I recently started.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo WPSEO_Frontend::metadesc( false );?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the same code is not working in my old blog in which Meta Description using Yoast Plugin from the post editor is already set up for all the posts and that's giving this error where I inserted the above code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/home/myblog/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/frontend/class-frontend.php on line 809\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If anyone of you have encountered this issue before and got it working somehow, please help me out.

I know there is no real \"normal\" Wordpress script and yet I think it would be quite useful to hear from people what a typical Wordpress script's memory footprint is. Let's call \"normal\" for sake of argument as a installation with very few plugins, a base type theme like twenty-twelve, and a script that has some DB retrieval but nothing monumental ... maybe a typical blog roll page or something. What I'm trying to understand is what is the baseline memory footprint (a range not a discrete number) that a more complicated script would be starting from?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Memory Ceiling Versus memory_get_usage()</strong>. I have been putting lots of logging in my scripts that pull out the memory usage by using PHP's memory_get_usage(true) call. This seems like one of the few troubleshooting techniques that determine where the memory is being used but what perplexes me is that I see memory usage ranging from 15M to 45M at the script level -- note this is with the \"true\" parameter so this includes the overhead of the memory manager - and yet in many instances I'll see a 27M script all of a sudden fall over with the message that the \"Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted\". It is possible that maybe there is one very large memory request that takes place after the logging but I'm interested to hear if other people have found any differences between the memory limit and the memory reported by memory_get_usage()?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>New Memory Ceiling Ignored</strong>. In a desperate attempt to get the site back to working -- and buy me time to troubleshoot -- I thought I'd just up the memory limit in the php.ini file to 512M but doing this seems to have had no impact. The fatal error continues to talk about the old 256M limit.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.

I get very strange results. In Firefox, all the songs seems to get loaded correctly on the home page, but page 2 of the posts don't load.

Some songs will play on the pages, and some won't. All of the songs are mp3 and play just fine, so I'm not sure where my problem is.

The problem I am having is that getUser() <strong>always</strong> returns 0 even though there is definitely a user logged in. Basically, my code works as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have an options page (within wordpress) that when it is loaded creates an instance of a wrapper class ror the PHP SDK Facebook class like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$facebook = new FacebookAPI;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The constructor for this wrapper creates an instance of the PHP SDK Facebook class and saves it, while also setting a few class variables and doing some work to manage sessions saved within the plugin.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then within the options page there is a button that is is a link to the login_url generated by the Facebook object, i.e. getLoginUrl(). The login Url is called this way, using the wrapper class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Set Login Url\n$params = array(\n    'scope' =&gt; 'user_photos,user_photo_video_tags',\n    'redirect_uri' =&gt; FB_REDIRECT_URI,\n    'display' =&gt; 'page'\n);\n$loginURL = $facebook-&gt;get_login_url($params);\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The redirect_uri here is the plugin options page within the wordpress and when the page is reloaded there is code that checks to see if the login process has completed okay. It does this by looking to see if the url contains a 'code' variable, i.e. if $_REQUEST['code'] is set. (This is what FB does when it sucessfully completes the login/permissions process.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> \nIf the 'code' is set in the request object, I think I should then be able to call getUser() on the facebook sdk class and get the user id.  This is where I run into the problem. getUser() <strong>always</strong> returns 0, and I haven't been able to figure out why. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I have noticed, however, is that if I do var_dump($_SESSION), the array is empty.

We dont wanted all this 64*8 actual wordpress pages to be created. </p>\n\n<p>So after searching much on net we had one solution that I implemented one plugin for routing.</p>\n\n<p>IN that code snippet was as follow.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function site_router() {\n\nglobal $route,$wp_query,$window_title;\nerror_reporting(E_ALL);\nif ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404 ) \n    {\n        $wp_query-&gt;is_404 = false;\n        $cUrl=\"http://\".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];\n        $targetUrl=\"\";\n        switch($cUrl)\n                {\n                /* According to condition  I had written diffent cases like below.\n                */\n        default :\n            {           \n            include(get_template_directory() . \"/home.php\" ); \n            $template =locate_template('pagepath/home.php');\n                        $window_title = 'dynamically it will come';\n                        if ($template) {\n                        load_template($template);\n                        die;\n                        }\n                    }                   \n\n                }\n         }\n}\n\nadd_action( 'wp', 'site_router');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So by this my purpose was fulfilled successfully. </p>\n\n<p>But now problem is that google is saying they are getting back a 404 error. I think obviosly it will give as after it gives the error we are doing all template loading and all stuff. </p>\n\n<p>So Can any body guide me how can I do this before that 404 response is given to google.</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","wordpress","css3","wordpress-plugin","contact-form-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":12945827,"title":"How to align the Contact Form 7 plugin form horizonal?","body":"<p>I've been trying for a few hours to find the way to display the contact form input fields horizontally as in the module before the contact form here: <a href=\"http://zohar.mapasystem.co.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zohar.mapasystem.co.il/</a></p>\n\n<p>The idea is to replace the Property Search with my Contact Form 7 shortcode.</p>\n\n<p>Using a  is not an option, since the theme changes automatically the layout for mobile browsers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; שם מלא (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text* text-3 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; טלפון (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text* text-648 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; אימייל (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[email* email-827 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; תקציב להשקעה&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text text-214 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label class=\"lastsub\"&gt; [submit class:gg \"שלח\"] &lt;/label&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried  with width, float, display:inline, etc, etc, but I think my problem is with HTML5.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","sql","database","wordpress"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13052971,"title":"integrating Databases in wordpress","body":"<p>I was wondering if you guys can help me out.\nWe are developing a new forum component on our website. \nThe forum is being created with PHP and MySQL and we want to integrate it with Wordpress.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem is, that we don't want to create a whole new Register Forum because this will force the user to create TWO accounts (one for the site and one for the forum) and this is not user friendly.</p>\n\n<p>So if you know a way to use the wordpress website user database with an outside database it will be great.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is to create a whole new data base but then we force the users out of the commenting section on the Wordpress website.

So I guess it has something to do with the usual processing of Ajax calls in wordpress which must go through the admin-ajax.php file in the wp-admin folder!? I am not sure how to cut this datatrans implementation into pieces to make it fit the wordpress Ajax processing. Furthermore I would like to know if you think that my guess is even right regarding what causes the error?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nTim</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","wordpress"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":34,"score":-1,"question_id":13050897,"title":"Retrieve value from PHP array - Taxonomy Custom Field","body":"<p>I have been trying to retrieve data from custom fields attatched to a Taxonomy in WordPress using the framework found at <a href=\"http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/taxonomy-meta-script-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/taxonomy-meta-script-for-wordpress/</a></p>\n\n<p>The data has been saved correctly but using their retrieval example I have still been unable to retrieve it, if i do the following....</p>\n\n<pre><code>$meta = get_option('first_section');\nif (empty($meta)) $meta = array();\nif (!is_array($meta)) $meta = (array) $meta;\n$meta = isset($meta['6']) ? $meta['6'] : array();\n$value = $meta['website'];\necho $value; // if you want to show\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't work, but if I do a var_dump on $meta = get_option('first_section'); I get this...</p>\n\n<pre><code>array(7) { [0]=&gt; bool(false) [11]=&gt; array(0) { } [9]=&gt; array(0) { } [7]=&gt; array(5) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(24) \"http://www.mydomain.com\" [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(33) \"https://twitter.com/mysite1\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(33) \"http://facebook.com/mysite1\" [\"googleplus\"]=&gt; string(79) \"https://plus.google.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"223\" } } [5]=&gt; array(6) { [\"address\"]=&gt; string(7) \"bbvbvvb\" [\"website\"]=&gt; string(35) \"http://www.mydomain.com/mysite\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"224\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite\" [\"googleplus\"]=&gt; string(79) \"https://plus.google.com\" } [6]=&gt; array(4) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(26) \"http://www.mysite4.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"225\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite4\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite4\" } [8]=&gt; array(4) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(21) \"http://www.mysite5.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"226\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite2\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite2\" } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I echo the <strong>'website'</strong> field from the array <strong>'6'</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the value I am trying to retrieve array(6) { [\"address\"]=> string(7) \"bbvbvvb\" [\"website\"]=> string(35) \"http://www.mydomain.com/mysite\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","permalinks","custom-taxonomy"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13048990,"title":"Include taxonomy slug in url?","body":"<p>I have the following custom post-type and custom taxonomy setup:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action( 'init', 'create_post_type' );\nfunction create_post_type() {\n    register_post_type( 'system',\n        array(\n            'labels' =&gt; array(\n                'name' =&gt; __( 'Systems' ),\n                'singular_name' =&gt; __( 'System' )\n            ),\n        'capability_type' =&gt; 'post',\n        'supports' =&gt; array('title','editor','comments'),   \n        'public' =&gt; true,\n        'has_archive' =&gt; true,\n        'rewrite' =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'system' ),\n        )\n    );\n}\n\nfunction news_init() {\n    register_taxonomy(\n        'system',\n        'system',\n        array(\n            'label' =&gt; __( 'Product Category' ),\n            'sort' =&gt; true,\n            'hierarchical' =&gt; true,\n            'args' =&gt; array( 'orderby' =&gt; 'term_order' ),\n            'rewrite' =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'products' )\n        )\n    );  \n}\nadd_action( 'init', 'news_init' );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it possible to include the custom taxonomy name in the URL?</p>\n\n<p>At present when I goto a custom post the URL looks like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.domain.com/products/(post-name)/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.domain.com/products/(post-name)/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can I make it look like the following?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.domain.com/(category-slug)/(post-name)/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.domain.com/(category-slug)/(post-name)/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've tried going to that URL but it just gives a 404.

I've been working on a shopping cart plugin for WordPress for quite a while now.  I started coding it at the end of 2008 (and it's been one of those \"work on it when I have time\" projects, so the going is very slow, obviously!) and got pretty far with it.  Even had a few testers take me up on it and give me feedback. (Please note that this plugin is also meant to be a fee download - I have no intention of making it a premium plugin.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in 2010, when all the PCI/DSS stuff became standard, I shelved it, because the plugin was meant to retain certain information in the database, and I was not 100% sure what qualified as \"sensitive data,\" and I didn't want to put anything out there that might compromise anyone, and possibly come back on me.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks, some colleagues and I have been having a discussion about PCI/DSS compliance, and it's sparked a re-interest in finally finishing this plugin.  I'm going to remove the storage of credit card numbers and any data of that nature, but I do like the idea of storing the names and shipping addresses of people who voluntarily might want to create an account with the site that might use this plugin so if they shop there again, that kind of info is retained. Keep in mind, the data stored would be <em>public information</em> - the kind of thing you'd find in a phone book, or a peek in the record room of a courthouse. So nothing like storing SS#'s, medical histories or credit card numbers. Just stuff that would maybe let someone see past purchases, and retain some info to make a future checkout process a bit easier.</p>\n\n<p>One of my colleagues suggested I still do something to enhance security a bit, since the name and shipping address would likely be passed to whatever payment gateway the site owner would choose to use. They suggested I use \"one-way encryption.\"  Now, I'm not a huge security freak, but I'm pretty sure this involves (one aspect anyway) stuff like MD5 hashes with salts, or the like.  So this confuses me, because I wouldn't have the slightest idea of where to look to see how to use that kind of thing with my code, and/or if it will work when passing that kind of data to PayPal or Google Checkout, or Mal's, or what have you.</p>\n\n<p>So I suppose this isn't an \"I need code examples\" kind of question, but more of a \"please enlighten me, because I'm sort of a dunce\" kind of question. (which, I'm sure, makes people feel much better about the fact that I'm writing a shopping cart plugin LOL)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","css","wordpress"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":38,"score":-2,"question_id":13047365,"title":"Links not working","body":"<p>Can anyone see why my links in my header are not working for the home and contact us page.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rg3fitness.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rg3fitness.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Can't seem to see any problems with the code.

Obviously I will need to change the css but first I need to figure out how to insert it where I want it, such as in my index.php for example.</p>\n\n<p>The author posted some code here: <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/dkTbG4tk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/dkTbG4tk</a></p>\n\n<p>Which I believe is what I'm supposed to use to manually insert the plugin where I want but that is where I'm stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Is that the code I need and if so, where do I put it?

I was also able to prevent it from loading in the footer by commenting out line 35 in buddypress-activity-stream-bar/bp-activity-bar.php (not sure if that was the correct way to do it but it worked!)</p>\n\n<p>However now I have a new issue, which wasn't present when the activity bar was loading in the footer as a floating bar.</p>\n\n<p>When the page first loads, all 20 items that the activity bar cycles through are shown, in one vertical stack, see screenshot: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8mphgja\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/8mphgja</a></p>\n\n<p>Once the page finishes loading, it \"retracts\" and shows one line at a time like it's supposed to, see screenshot: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/93f7tou\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/93f7tou</a></p>\n\n<p>What can I do so that the list items stay hidden while the page is loading?</p>\n\n<p>==================================================================================</p>\n\n<h1>UPDATE #2</h1>\n\n<p>Okay, figured out that issue too, guess I should have just played around with it some more before posting my question :)</p>\n\n<p>To summarize just in case anyone else reads this that had the same problem I had, here is what I did from start to finish.</p>\n\n<p>I pasted the \"Rotate through activity\" code ( <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/0mfxYKCD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/0mfxYKCD</a> ) in my header.php before the closing head tag.</p>\n\n<p>Then I picked the location in my template where I wanted the activity bar to appear.  In my case, I wanted it to appear below my navigation on every page, so I pasted the \"Live Activity\" code ( <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/7bYseXc5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/7bYseXc5</a> ) at the end of my header.php file inside div tags.</p>\n\n<p>Then, to prevent all 20 items from showing when the page loads, I just had to define a max-height for my div container, so for example mine was:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.activity-bar\n{\nmax-height: 85px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally, since I didn't want the activity bar to appear in the footer as well (which is how it's supposed to work by default), I commented out line 35 in buddypress-activity-stream-bar/bp-activity-bar.php, so that the code isn't loaded in the footer.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that's how I manually inserted the \"Buddypress Activity Stream Bar\" into my theme.  Hope that helps someone else out! If anyone has any comments or suggestions on how to better accomplish this, please let me know! My one lingering concern is that if the plugin is updated, I will have to go back in and comment out the line that loads it in the footer again.  If anyone knows a way to prevent that, let me know, thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","jquery","wordpress","responsive-design"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13021251,"title":"Which jQuery method should be used to load in a block of markup in this conditional css function?","body":"<p>I am using WordPress to <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/examples/ConditionalCSS/\" rel=\"nofollow\">load content conditionally</a> depending on the viewport size, but I need to replace the <code>load()</code> method with a more appropriate method.

It is only used once and on this page. However, the problem with this is that the <code>custom_hook()</code> code is rendered on the page and that hook includes a bunch of markup. If the javascript determines that I'm using <code>A</code>, all that markup is on the page in the source code for no reason. I want to find a way to prevent the custom hook from rendering UNLESS it's being used in <code>B</code>.

In addition to that, the customer also had to change servers within the hosting provider to get newer php version so I had to write the htaccess file from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the current htaccess-file :</p>\n\n<pre><code># BEGIN WordPress\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /www/\nRewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule . /www/index.php [L]\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\n# END WordPress\n\nRewriteEngine On\nOptions +FollowSymlinks\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?subdomainurl.com$ [NC]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/subdomainfolder/\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ subdomainfolder/$1 [L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Wordpress in installed in a folder named www and the url is being rewritten, it works beautifully. But I'm having problems with the subdomain. In the code above I've replaced the subdomain url with subdomainurl.com, the site lies in public_html/subdomainfolder/.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I type www.subdomainurl.com, the redirect works, the site is shown. But www.subdomainurl.index.html typed doesn't. It has to be written www.subdomainurl.com/subdomainfolder/index.html, so I'm clearly not writing the redirect right, adding the subdomain folder as well. I've tried to mingle with that htaccess but can't get it right. Everytime I try to change something I get a 404 in the main domain's Wordpress site.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment these work:\nwww.maindomain.com/subdomainfolder/index.html\nwww.subdomainurl.com/subdomainfolder/index.html</p>\n\n<p>And this doesn't, which I'm trying to do:\nwww.subdomainurl.com/index.html</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a redirect expert, any help would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit/Addon :</em></p>\n\n<p>Here is the old code from the old server that redirected the subdomain to the subfolder and rewrote the url, it doesn't work anymore so I ditched it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?subdomainurl.com$ [NC]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/subdomainfolder/\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /subdomainfolder/$1\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?subdomainurl.com$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(/)?$ subdomainfolder/index.html [L]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","wordpress-plugin","captcha","contact-form"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12969703,"title":"Can't re-install REALLY SIMPLE CAPTCHA plugin for Wordpress","body":"<p>I installed the plugin REALLY SIMPLE CAPTCHA v1.5 for my form plugin CONTACT FORM 7, to lessen the huge amount of spam that was coming through.

Any questions let me know, because I may have made that sound confusing.\nCheers</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","wordpress-theming","custom-headers"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":686,"score":0,"question_id":4963929,"title":"Disable Aspect Ratio Crop on Custom Header Image","body":"<p>Hey Guys,\nI'm building a WordPress theme that let's a user upload a custom image header using the built in WordPress functions. </p>\n\n<p>I have this set in my functions.php file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>define( 'HEADER_IMAGE_WIDTH', apply_filters( 'basic_header_image_width', 500 ) );\ndefine( 'HEADER_IMAGE_HEIGHT', apply_filters( 'basic_header_image_height', 150 ) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when a user uploads a new image, they are forced to crop the image to maintain the 150x500 aspect ratio.

The new feature list in Plone 4 was totally <em>underwhelming</em> to me ( <a href=\"http://plone.org/products/plone/features\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://plone.org/products/plone/features</a> ).</p>\n\n<p>Drupal 7 new features ( <a href=\"http://drupalcode.org/viewvc/drupal/drupal/CHANGELOG.txt?revision=1.373&amp;view=markup\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://drupalcode.org/viewvc/drupal/drupal/CHANGELOG.txt?revision=1.373&amp;view=markup</a>) and Wordpress 3 ( <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0</a> ) seem to have done <em>tons more</em> in their new major releases.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover replacement to Archetypes through Dexterity ( <a href=\"http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/faq/how-is-dexterity-related-to-archetypes/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/faq/how-is-dexterity-related-to-archetypes/view</a> ) is also a great step forward. So while Plone 4 itself may be an improvement over 3.x is it enough to keep Plone in the reckoning amongst other CMSes?</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to my question:</p>\n\n<p>Is Plone on a steady decline? Whats the future of Plone? Am I wrong in my assessment that Plone is not adding functionality and features at the rate other top tier CMSes are? </p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=plone\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/trends?q=plone</a> seems to confirm my fears.</p>\n\n<p>Should I give Plone 4 a try and make it my \"second\" CMS?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":12932095,"title":"WordPress TinyMCE get Content using POST","body":"<p>I want to integrate tinymce editor into plugin options page and save its value.

In this question, i am focusing to the white screen of death that i get whenever i want to activate certain plugins. I am developing a site that requires me to use 30 plugins. Yeah, some will say thats too many plugins for a site, no wonder i will get the white screen. But hey, this is Wordpress, one of the reason that makes Wordpress the most popular blogging platform is because the availability of the plugins that can make you achieve your goal in less time. For those who expert in php+wp development, you guys can say hack the wp is better than using a lot of plugins like what i am doing but hey, majority of wp users are not php guru. Most of them are normal user like me or even just know how to install and use what are available to them.</p>\n\n<p>So far, here the common steps we do when get the white screen of death (WSOD).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rename the <strong>wp-content/plugins</strong> folder name such as <strong>wp-content/plugins-temp</strong>, this will deactivate all plugins</li>\n<li>Like me, i prefer rename the individual plugin folder name, such as <strong>wp-content/plugins/akismet</strong> to <strong>wp-content/plugins/akismet-temp</strong></li>\n<li>After that, reactivate all the plugins one by one, so we can know which plugin is the culprit</li>\n<li>Check for extra empty space at the end of the plugin file, especially after the php closing tag ?> make sure there is no extra space after the tag. Make sure check at the theme functions.php file (if any) or the plugin file.</li>\n<li>Increase the memory allocation for wordpress</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Usually, your site will be back to normal after that. <strong>BUT</strong> this will still not solve this problem.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this is very annoying to me, especially the step number 3. How can we know which plugin is the culprit?? At the first place, i thought the step number 3 is really a fact but now i think its a lie. WHY?</p>\n\n<p>Like right now, suddenly after i activate 25 plugins, one of plugin that i cannot reactivate is Akismet. What? Akismet? Yes, the plugin dev by the WP team itself. I know the step number 3 above is a lie because if i activate Akismet first, the Akismet is activated successfully. No problem at all.</p>\n\n<p>So right now the problem is plugins compatibility among the plugins. How can me as a normal user can identify which plugin that is not friendly to what plugin??? If i am using 30 plugins, how many probabilities from one plugin is not compatible to each plugin???? how can i know which plugins should be activated first so the WSOD will not appear?</p>\n\n<p>If there is error, then maybe i can have a clue, but its a plain white screen. I am clueless. This clash of plugins in wordpress is really an unsolved problem that makes me really stress.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone know how to fix this? At least know how to activate the plugins via mysql?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","css","wordpress","tinymce","embed"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":77,"score":1,"question_id":12872907,"title":"How to put in script tags inside Wordpress Editor?","body":"<p>Been struggling with this problem for hours!</p>\n\n<p>Websites like <a href=\"http://cssdeck.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSSDeck</a> gives an embed code that consists of a <code>pre</code> and <code>script</code> tag.

For the navigation I’m using a custom nav walker (that extends <code>Walker_Nav_Menu</code>). This all works very well and allows URLs such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/mediums/print/ (showing selection of print projects)\n/clients/clientA (showing selection of projects for clientA)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have page templates for clients and mediums and templates taxonomy-clients.php and taxonomy-mediums.php.

We customised this so wordpress creates a new user based on email field for username for wordpress if an unregistered user created the advert and to assign the new advert to his account. It also checks if the email address already has an account, and if so, it doesn't create a new account but assigns the advert to the account already existing.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have added pay by mobile functionality and the equivalent of step3.php is basically a file called tpl-thanks_post_ad.php - this uses a notification function and a private key to communicate the mobile solution provider and auto-approve the ad. </p>\n\n<p>I am just wondering if I could possibly put the notification function in the step3.php instead so i can avail of the user creation bit but only use it when paying by mobile. </p>\n\n<p>the first step in the form has this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>           &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n        // &lt;![CDATA[\n          jQuery(document).ready(function() {\n           ******.Widget(****, {\n         CtrlId: 'paymentBoxLaunchControlId',\n        ServiceId: '****',\n       CountryCode: 'IE',\n       LanguageCode: 'en',\n       ItemCode: 'HM001',\n       Mode: 'SIMULATION',\n       ReturnUrl: '&lt;?php echo get_site_url(); ?&gt;/thank-you-ad-posting/',\n       ShowCloseButton: true,\n       WidgetLoadedCallbackUrl: '&lt;?php echo get_site_url(); ?&gt;/mobile-notify/',\n       OnWidgetLoadAttempt: function() { /*alert('function called prior to lanuching payment box');*/ },\n       CustomString: '&lt;?php echo $post-&gt;ID;?&gt;'\n       // CssUrl: 'http://your-domain/custom-widget.css', // default to use ******'s CSS\n     });\n     });\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am guessing I change this thank-you-ad-posting bit to the step3.php page but inside the step3.php I am not sure how to insert the function so that it only runs if it's mobile payment.

On the main domain is WordPress set up as a WordPress MU install. I KNOW that I can set this up using subdomains with a wildcard entry to my DNS to save myself this headache, BUT my host doesn't allow it and would require me to buy a private server, which I'm not interested in right now since this is more of a test/personal project than anything else and wouldn't garner enough attention/traffic. </p>\n\n<p>So, I've set up WordPressMU to create subdirectories for each of the new sites I add. Right now I have 5 total. The main site (which will be for presenting updates from the four other subsites), and then four subject specific sites. I want the sites to be able to be accessed and browsed by their subdomain, and not the subdirectories. So I really think .htaccess is the route I would have to take since I can't set up my subdomain to point to a directory that doesn't really exist.</p>\n\n<p>PS Thanks in advance for any/all help and suggestions.

This is the essential guts of how I am doing it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action('save_post', 'my_save_post');\n\nfuntion my_save_post($post_id)\n{\n    // Check if not autosaving, processing correct post type etc.\n    // ...\n\n    // Get the custom field value.\n    $my_field_value = get_post_meta($post_id, 'my_field', true);\n\n    // Do some action\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine when updating the post through the admin page. However, when first creating the post, the <code>my_field_value</code> is always empty. The field does get saved correctly, but this action trigger does not seem to be able to see it, nor any other custom field values.</p>\n\n<p>I would like the action to be performed on all posts of this type created, and I will be importing many through the CSV Imported plugin. Even then, the custom fields do get imported correctly, and the action trigger does get fired for each row imported, but the save_post action still cannot see the custom field value.</p>\n\n<p>So far as I can see from documentation, the post has already been created by the time this action fires, so I should always be able to see that custom metafield.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The answer, it seems, is in the order in which things happen. When creating a post from a form, the custom fields are all collected by the appropriate actions and added to the post before my save_post action fires. This means my trigger is able to see those custom field values.</p>\n\n<p>When importing from CSV, the basic post is created first, and then the custom metafields are added. The save_post trigger fires on the first creation, before the metafields are added, and so the custom field data is not visible to the save_post action.</p>\n\n<p>My solution was to catch the updates of the metadata using the <code>updated_post_meta</code> and <code>added_post_meta</code> actions <em>as well as</em> the <code>save_post</code> action:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action('updated_post_meta', 'my_updated_post_meta', 10, 4);\nadd_action('added_post_meta', 'my_updated_post_meta', 10, 4);\n\nfunction my_updated_post_meta($meta_id, $post_id, $meta_key, $meta_value)\n{\n    // Make sure we are handling just the meta field we are interested in.\n    if ($meta_key != 'my_custom_field') return;\n    if (wp_is_post_revision($post_id)) return;\n    if (get_post_type($post_id) != 'my_post_type') return;\n    if (trim($meta_value) == '') return;\n\n    // Do my custom task (linking this post to a parent post in a different\n    // post type). This is the same task performed by the save_post action.\n    my_link_product_track($post_id, trim($meta_value));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is essentially what I do, and it seems to work well. I do encapsulate all the above into a custom class in the theme, and don't recommend using global scope variables as shown here, but this is just to show the method.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","wordpress-theming"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":43,"score":-1,"question_id":12805233,"title":"Wordpress not showing the_title()","body":"<pre><code>&lt;?php $loop = new WP_Query(array('post_type' =&gt; 'portfolio', 'posts_per_page' =&gt; 10)); ?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php while ( $loop-&gt;have_posts() ) : $loop-&gt;the_post(); ?&gt;\n         &lt;?php\n\n              $post = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID);\n              $img = $post['image_url'][0];\n              $web = $post['website_url'][0];\n              echo get_the_title();\n              the_title();\n              the_content();\n\n          ?&gt;\n&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm trying display title, content is displaying ok, but is something wrong with title.

So what I want to do is hide this div class when the input id value is empty so that the icon disappears.</p>\n\n<p>When I asked this question before someone said to use this jQuery:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\n    if($('#mytheme_twitter').val() == '' ){$('.twitter').hide();}  \n\n    $('#mytheme_twitter').on('change' , function() {\n\n         if( this.value != ''){\n\n               $('.twitter').show(); \n          }\n          else{\n               $('.twitter').hide(); \n         }\n    });\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I put this jQuery in my header.php but for some reason it's not working. The name of the div class is definitely '.twitter' so could it be the selector of the input id that is wrong? I went into the options panel on Firefox and highlighted the input box with Firebug and it is definitely '#mytheme_twitter' I've also tried 'input#mytheme_twitter' but that doesn't work either. </p>\n\n<p>The options panel is in another php file, not the index.php one. Could that be the reason why it's not working... because that input id hasn't been defined in the index.php? I don't know much about this myself because I'm a jQuery noob and I've only recently started getting the hang of php too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","wordpress","upload","content-management-system"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":24,"score":-1,"question_id":12805176,"title":"Major Project - Upload System","body":"<p>I'm just wondering if anybody could give me some pointers in creating a sign up/upload website such as www.dribbble.com.
