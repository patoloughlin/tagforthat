On row 3, you can see what would happen if I assigned a featured class to the row 3 center column (col-2)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xtGq1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>I need to somehow, assign class name <code>col-1</code> <code>col-2</code> <code>col-3</code> or <code>featured</code> to all posts in the while loop and make sure that the <code>featured</code> post are always in the column-1 position.</p>\n\n<p>I am open to any suggestions or help on how I could achieve this?</p>\n\n<p>Below is a sample code of the PHP loop...

Is there a way for me to control the position of where this menu item is added to (For example: add this item after the first two items?) </p>\n\n<p>and how can I get WordPress to treat this dynamically generated menu item as a regular menu item and have it add all the classes that it adds the other menu items (created through the WordPress menu feature)?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":43,"score":1,"question_id":13225033,"title":"With Wordpress themes, where do I store the images and files relatively?","body":"<p>In pure HTML, I'm used to storing the files relative to where the particular HTML file is, such as <code>css/style.css</code>.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the theme I'm using with Wordpress, \"Responsive\" I don't know where the images are to be stored.</p>\n\n<p>Can you even use relative linking with wordpress?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1195,"score":1,"question_id":4819167,"title":"Wordpress plugin for external DB login","body":"<p>Do any one know </p>\n\n<p>any word press plugin that can used for external dB login ,apart from word press plugin </p>\n\n<p>'<strong>External DB authentication</strong>' because it is not compactable for word press latest version 3.0.4</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","templates","comments","category"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13216801,"title":"WORDPRESS: Disable comments in \"News\" Category and Enable in \"Blog\" Category?","body":"<p>I have a News page that displays all the posts within the \"News\" Category.

Please keep in mind that some frameworks require a CSS file to exist for a particular reason (i.e. WordPress themes require a style.css file in order to be recognized).</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: When I say 'considering using LESS', I mean it becomes a requirement. New developers would not have the option use vanilla CSS after the choice is in favor of LESS.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","wordpress-theming"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":13193978,"title":"Develop Mobile Theme in Wordpress","body":"<p>I have made a wordpress theme of a site.

Have had this since day 1 and its worked out well until recently.</p>\n\n<p>It's related to portfolios and wordpress (3.4.2).</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly (perhaps after some recent plugin update or change in wind direction:) ) I started getting 404s on all my portfolio 'items'.</p>\n\n<p>Portfolio list (page) works ok. Such as <a href=\"http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/</a></p>\n\n<p>I switched permalinks to default (numeric). And suddenly portfolio items like the below started showing:\n<a href=\"http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/portfolio-item/honda-nsx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/portfolio-item/honda-nsx/</a></p>\n\n<p>But portfolio category doesn't show:\n<a href=\"http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dasilvamotorsport.com/performance-project-portfolio/</a></p>\n\n<p>Switching back to postname as permalink basically reverts back to the original issue that portfolio items don't show up.

I've refreshed a dozen times, restarted the server, checked and double checked .htaccess to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>Again, all of this was working perfectly until a couple of weeks ago so really not sure what happened. Is there something I can debug or try? I've tried WP_DEBUG but for some reason the debug.log file is never created so not sure what's going on there.

The contact form in question is a normal contact inquiry form, so I need to retain the usual functionality (mailing the data).  However I also have a checkbox on the form that allows the sender to choose whether to subscribe to the client's mailing list in addition to mailing the contact inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>The client uses Bronto for their mass mailing (similar to CC or Mailchimp).  Bronto has a \"direct add\" feature (<a href=\"http://community.bronto.com/blog/how-to/adding-contacts-direct-add\" rel=\"nofollow\">more info here</a>) that allows you to send parameters to add contacts to the Bronto account by embedding an image whose url contains the requisite parameters (email address, list to subscribe to, etc).</p>\n\n<p>I can construct the image url with the contact form parameters no problem, but actually getting the image request sent is a different matter.  I am over my head both in PHP and JS here and not sure what course to take.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm using the <code>wpcf7_before_send_mail</code> php hook built into CF7 and this appears to allow me to collect the form data and build the URL.  However, since the plugin uses AJAX and doesn't actually redirect to another page on form submission it seems I can't successfully use any kind of php output (echo, alert, even error_log), presumably because the server doesn't know what it's supposed to write to.</p>\n\n<p>In functions.php:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action( 'wpcf7_before_send_mail', 'bronto_contact_add' );\nfunction bronto_contact_add( $cf7 ) {\n    $emailcf = $cf7-&gt;posted_data['email'];\n    echo $emailcf;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is just a test to see if echo works - it does not.  Instead the form just hangs on submission and I see the rotating loading gif forever.</p>\n\n<p>What I need to do is build the image url using parameters from the cf7 object (which I can do no problem) and then somehow send that image request to the Bronto server (this is the part I am confused about).  If this was a normal form that redirected to another php page upon submission I would have no problem doing this at all, but it uses AJAX which I don't know much about so I'm pretty lost now.</p>\n\n<p>Can anybody help shed some light on how the best way to accomplish this might be?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","widget","switch-statement"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":18,"score":1,"question_id":13179162,"title":"Wordpress widget constantly switching","body":"<p>I work as a Webmaster at a Canadian company named Atrium Innovations.

My site is running the latest version of Wordpress (3.4.2).</p>\n\n<p>The ideal system would work like this:</p>\n\n<p>The user fills out a form with information about the paper (format, structure, etc.). The user then copy and pastes their paper into a textarea that counts the number of words and displays a total in a read-only input box below. Everything up to this point is definitely doable. Where I'm running into trouble is having the calculation then affect the total price of the service (charging by word, depending on the number of days selected until the paper is due). Again, I can write a script to do all this and calculate the total price, but I don't know how to send the form information to the database and then enter the total price into a custom Paypal field in order to use Paypal to charge the user.</p>\n\n<p>I have thought about doing this a few different ways but am open to suggestions. One is to accept the user information on one screen and after submitting it to the database, having a second screen that imports the word count price calculation into the Paypal custom field.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea (ideally) would be to send the form to two places, both the database as well as to Paypal so that it would take less clicks for a user to submit and purchase the service.</p>\n\n<p>A final idea I had was to use an altered shopping cart plugin like WP-Ecommerce and create some kind of custom field that would help in calculating all of this, but unfortunately, try as I might, I haven't been able to figure out how to make it work as it should.</p>\n\n<p>Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

The project admin is able to upload a csv file from the WP admin interface.  On the client side, when the file is uploaded it goes through each line of the file, extracts the necessary info about the users and then makes an AJAX call to add the participant to the project.  I decided to parse the csv file on the client side and submit the ajax requests one by one so that I could update a progress bar as each returns. The javascript looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$( '#csv_upload_button' ).click( function() {\n    // declare the necessary variables\n    var f = $( '#csv_file_input' )[0].files[0],\n        fr = new FileReader,\n        rows, headers, dialog, count, remaining;\n    // when the file loads\n    fr.onload = function() {\n        // get the rows, the count, number remaining to process, and headers\n        rows = fr.result.split( \"\\n\" );\n        remaining = count = rows.length - 1; // -1 to account for header row\n        headers = $.trim( rows[0] ).split( ',' );\n        // create the dialog box to show the progress bar\n        dialog = $( '&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' )\n                    .html( \n                        '&lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;' +\n                        '&lt;p&gt;&lt;progress id=\"csv_upload_progress\" max=\"' + count + \n                        '\" min=\"0\" value=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' )\n                    .dialog( { modal: true; } );\n        // then for each row in the file\n        $( rows ).each( function( i, r ) {\n            // create an object to hold the data\n            var data = {}, row = $.trim( r ).split( ',' ), j;\n            if ( i &gt; 0 ) { // data starts on the second row\n                // map the data into our object\n                for ( j = 0; j &lt; headers.length; j++ ) {\n                    data[ headers[ j ] ] = row[ j ];\n                }\n                // send it to the server\n                $.post(\n                    ajaxurl, \n                    { \n                        action: 'import_panel_member', \n                        data: data, \n                        postid: $( '#post_ID' ).val() \n                    }, \n                    function( result ) {\n                        var prog = $( '#csv_upload_progress' );\n                        prog.attr( 'value', prog.attr( 'value' ) + 1 );\n                        if ( 0 == --remaining ) {\n                            // stuff to do when everything has been loaded\n                        }\n                    }\n                );\n            }\n        });\n    };\n    // read the csv file\n    fr.readAsText( f );\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The PHP looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>function import_panel_member() {\n    header( 'content-type: application/json' );\n    // get the variables sent from the client\n    $postid = $_POST[ 'postid' ];\n    $data   = $_POST[ 'data'   ];\n    /*\n     * ...do other things involving talking to a 3rd party server...\n     */\n    // get the WP meta data variable to be updated\n    $participants = get_post_meta( $postid, '_project_participants', true );\n    // modify it\n    $participants[] = $data;\n    // update the database\n    update_post_meta( $postid, '_project_participants', $participants );\n    // return a message to the client\n    echo json_encode( (object) array( 'success' =&gt; 1, 'message' =&gt; 'added' ) );\n    exit;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that since these requests happen asynchronously, it appears that the <code>_project_participants</code> metadata field is only being updated by the last record to be processed.  In other words, only the last person in the list shows up in the list of participants.  Here are some things that I've tried:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change <code>$.post()</code> to <code>$.ajax()</code> and set <code>async: false</code></strong><br>\nThis works but it's much slower (due to synchronous calls) and for some reason it prevents my dialog box from showing up until after all the ajax calls have finished.</li>\n<li><strong>Upload the entire csv file to the server and deal with it there</strong><br>\nInstead of parsing the csv on the client side.  This works, too, but I don't think I can get intermediate feedback from the server that I can use to update the progress bar.  This request can take quite a while, and I don't want users to \"give up\" on the request before it's complete. When doing it this way, sometimes the server never responds to the ajax call.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So perhaps I am greedy and just want my cake and to eat it, too.  How can I take advantage of the speed of asynchronous requests, which give me the opportunity to give the user feedback with a progress bar, but not screw myself up with concurrency issues on the server?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","html","css","wordpress","wordpress-theming"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13132547,"title":"Wordpress API Menu/Submenu Order","body":"<p>I'm developing a child-theme using <em>Wordpress 3.4.2</em> and the development version of the <em><a href=\"https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-theme\" rel=\"nofollow\">Options Framework</a></em> by <em>David Price</em>.

C doesn't - I need it to be different in the CSS lebel.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I would like to have a <code>has-children</code> class in A and B, but not in C.</p>\n\n<p>So far I've managed to create a \"Menu Walker\" PHP class that I can instantiate and pass to <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu\" rel=\"nofollow\">wp_nav_menu</a> . Its constructor looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class My_Walker_Nav_Menu extends Walker_Nav_Menu {\n  function start_el(&amp;$output, $item, $depth, $args) {\n    ...\n    if(??? $item has children???) {\n      // I know what to do here\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, how do I tell whether <code>$item</code> has children, or is a leaf?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: this question was answered by someone called \"keesiemeijer\" in the Wordpress forums.

I made plenty use of custom post types and custom taxonomies. Last but not least I made it multilingual using WPML plugin.</p>\n\n<p>During CPT declarations I wrapped strings and slugs in <code>gettext</code> in order to have them translation-ready within WPML.</p>\n\n<p>An example of CPT declaration is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>register_post_type('rooms',\n    array(\n        'label' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n        'description' =&gt; __('','valletta'),\n        'public' =&gt; true,\n        'show_ui' =&gt; true,\n        'show_in_menu' =&gt; true,\n        'capability_type' =&gt; 'post',\n        'hierarchical' =&gt; true,\n        'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; __('rooms','valletta')),\n        'query_var' =&gt; true,\n        'exclude_from_search' =&gt; false,\n        'menu_position' =&gt; 25,\n        'supports' =&gt; array('title','editor','excerpt','custom-fields','comments',),\n        'taxonomies' =&gt; array('features','typology',),\n        'labels' =&gt; array (\n            'name' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n            'singular_name' =&gt; __('room','valletta'),\n            'menu_name' =&gt; __('Rooms','valletta'),\n            'add_new' =&gt; __('Add room','valletta'),\n            'add_new_item' =&gt; __('Add New room','valletta'),\n            'edit' =&gt; __('Edit','valletta'),\n            'edit_item' =&gt; __('Edit room','valletta'),\n            'new_item' =&gt; __('New room','valletta'),\n            'view' =&gt; __('View room','valletta'),\n            'view_item' =&gt; __('View room','valletta'),\n            'search_items' =&gt; __('Search Rooms','valletta'),\n            'not_found' =&gt; __('No Rooms Found','valletta'),\n            'not_found_in_trash' =&gt; __('No Rooms Found in Trash','valletta'),\n            'parent' =&gt; __('Parent room','valletta'),\n        )\n    )\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I wrapped the slug term too and this (to me) make perfectly sense. What I wanted to achive was that when a user visits the \"standard\" website in Italian would reach a room CPT page via /camere/nome-camera/ while the English user would get it by /rooms/room-name/. This works smoothly for Italian language and WPML correctly translate slug for the English version too so if I'm viewing a room CPT in the Italian website and I switch to the English version, WordPress is taken to /rooms/ with the only problem that it shows a 404.</p>\n\n<p>I checked WPML website and they admit that slugs translation is still a work in progress and is a functionality that will problably released with next version of the plugin. Ok, that's fine.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to achive then is an hack to use while WPML updates is plugin. My idea is to have some few custom rewrite rules in my .htaccess and have a URL rewrite of those CPT pages. I thought that I could remove slug translation in order to have a single slug for both languages and then have a rewrite rule that when someone types the translated slug gets instead the \"standard\" one but at least the content is correct and: a) the user won't notice anything since the browser wont't redirect the page but just rewrite the URL and b) nothing changes for WP (or it does??).</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: how can I do all this? Removing slug translation is fine, just a delete on the WPML backend but I'm not very comfortable with rewrite rules and the like so I'm looking for someone to help me reach my goal and, eventually, show a better way to achieve what I need (and naturally have a feedback if my idea makes sense or not).</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I missed something.

How can I break the loop, and add the <code>.wrap</code> div only once and then continue the loop?</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ($wp_query-&gt;have_posts()) :\n\n    $wp_query-&gt;the_post(); \n    if($wp_query-&gt;current_post &lt;= 1){ ?&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"x\"&gt;\n        .. post 1\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;?php }\n    if($wp_query-&gt;current_post &gt; 1){ ?&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"wrap\"&gt; &lt;!-- should be only once --&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"y\"&gt;\n            .. post 2\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;div class=\"y\"&gt;\n            .. post 3\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- should be only once --&gt;\n    &lt;?php } ?&gt;\n\nendwhile;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["html","wordpress","twitter-bootstrap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13121835,"title":"div position is not fixed in different screen sizes","body":"<p>i m using tweeter bootstrap for my wordpres site.my problem is that i just made a div as right side bar and place some images onto it.it seems good on my desktop but when i see it on my laptop it change its position and goes downwards.please help me with this.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code for div and image placements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div style=\"position:fixed; top:188px; right:0px; border:0px solid #f00; width:25px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/delhi.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/noida.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jaipur.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://pearlacademy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chennai.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","wordpress","if-statement","insert","sql-update"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13121935,"title":"Update / Insert Statements","body":"<p>hi i have to do insert / update information form one external database to the wordpress database (Mysql 5.1).\ni have read a lot of statements about if exists do... but i don't get it...\ni tried to do it this way: </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT IF(\n          EXISTS\n             (SELECT *\n                FROM wp_MM_usermeta a, wp_mm_corum_user_import\n               WHERE     a.user_id =\n                            wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                     AND user_ID = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                     AND wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n                            IS NOT NULL),\n          (UPDATE wp_MM_usermeta, wp_mm_corum_user_import\n   SET meta_value = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_PER::Nachname`\n WHERE     wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress` IS NOT NULL\n       AND user_id = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n       AND wp_MM_usermeta.meta_key LIKE 'last_name'), \n       (INSERT INTO wp_MM_usermeta(meta_key, user_id, meta_value)\nVALUES (\n          (SELECT distinct 'last_name',\n                  user_id,\n                  wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_PER::Nachname`\n             FROM wp_mm_corum_user_import, wp_MM_usermeta\n            WHERE     user_id = wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress`\n\n                  AND wp_mm_corum_user_import.`_kflt_Wordpress` IS NOT NULL\n                  ))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but i can't do a insert / update statement during the select ...\nhow can i do this updates / Insert in a performant way?\nthx for any advice!</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","wordpress","slider"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13122055,"title":"jquery slider with specific link for each region","body":"<p>I have searched for something like this but without success..\n<a href=\"http://www.lifestylemirror.com/latest_cover/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lifestylemirror.com/latest_cover/</a>\nsomeone know where can I get one of this?

I just want to know if there is anyother way I can add the theme to my JSP pages.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13108280,"title":"Show Meta Description As Post Excerpts in Wordpress","body":"<p>I want to show Meta Description instead of post excerpts below the post title in my Wordpress blog's Loop pages(Main pagae, Category Pages, Tage Pages).</p>\n\n<p>I'm using Yoast Wordpress Seo Plugin and found the below code working in one of my blogs that I recently started.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo WPSEO_Frontend::metadesc( false );?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the same code is not working in my old blog in which Meta Description using Yoast Plugin from the post editor is already set up for all the posts and that's giving this error where I inserted the above code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/home/myblog/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/frontend/class-frontend.php on line 809\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If anyone of you have encountered this issue before and got it working somehow, please help me out.

I know there is no real \"normal\" Wordpress script and yet I think it would be quite useful to hear from people what a typical Wordpress script's memory footprint is. Let's call \"normal\" for sake of argument as a installation with very few plugins, a base type theme like twenty-twelve, and a script that has some DB retrieval but nothing monumental ... maybe a typical blog roll page or something. What I'm trying to understand is what is the baseline memory footprint (a range not a discrete number) that a more complicated script would be starting from?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Memory Ceiling Versus memory_get_usage()</strong>. I have been putting lots of logging in my scripts that pull out the memory usage by using PHP's memory_get_usage(true) call. This seems like one of the few troubleshooting techniques that determine where the memory is being used but what perplexes me is that I see memory usage ranging from 15M to 45M at the script level -- note this is with the \"true\" parameter so this includes the overhead of the memory manager - and yet in many instances I'll see a 27M script all of a sudden fall over with the message that the \"Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted\". It is possible that maybe there is one very large memory request that takes place after the logging but I'm interested to hear if other people have found any differences between the memory limit and the memory reported by memory_get_usage()?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>New Memory Ceiling Ignored</strong>. In a desperate attempt to get the site back to working -- and buy me time to troubleshoot -- I thought I'd just up the memory limit in the php.ini file to 512M but doing this seems to have had no impact. The fatal error continues to talk about the old 256M limit.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.

I get very strange results. In Firefox, all the songs seems to get loaded correctly on the home page, but page 2 of the posts don't load.

Some songs will play on the pages, and some won't. All of the songs are mp3 and play just fine, so I'm not sure where my problem is.

Basically, my code works as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have an options page (within wordpress) that when it is loaded creates an instance of a wrapper class ror the PHP SDK Facebook class like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$facebook = new FacebookAPI;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The constructor for this wrapper creates an instance of the PHP SDK Facebook class and saves it, while also setting a few class variables and doing some work to manage sessions saved within the plugin.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then within the options page there is a button that is is a link to the login_url generated by the Facebook object, i.e. getLoginUrl(). The login Url is called this way, using the wrapper class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Set Login Url\n$params = array(\n    'scope' =&gt; 'user_photos,user_photo_video_tags',\n    'redirect_uri' =&gt; FB_REDIRECT_URI,\n    'display' =&gt; 'page'\n);\n$loginURL = $facebook-&gt;get_login_url($params);\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The redirect_uri here is the plugin options page within the wordpress and when the page is reloaded there is code that checks to see if the login process has completed okay. It does this by looking to see if the url contains a 'code' variable, i.e. if $_REQUEST['code'] is set. (This is what FB does when it sucessfully completes the login/permissions process.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> \nIf the 'code' is set in the request object, I think I should then be able to call getUser() on the facebook sdk class and get the user id.  This is where I run into the problem. getUser() <strong>always</strong> returns 0, and I haven't been able to figure out why. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I have noticed, however, is that if I do var_dump($_SESSION), the array is empty.

I think obviosly it will give as after it gives the error we are doing all template loading and all stuff. </p>\n\n<p>So Can any body guide me how can I do this before that 404 response is given to google.</p>\n"},{"tags":["html5","wordpress","css3","wordpress-plugin","contact-form-7"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":1,"question_id":12945827,"title":"How to align the Contact Form 7 plugin form horizonal?","body":"<p>I've been trying for a few hours to find the way to display the contact form input fields horizontally as in the module before the contact form here: <a href=\"http://zohar.mapasystem.co.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zohar.mapasystem.co.il/</a></p>\n\n<p>The idea is to replace the Property Search with my Contact Form 7 shortcode.</p>\n\n<p>Using a  is not an option, since the theme changes automatically the layout for mobile browsers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; שם מלא (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text* text-3 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; טלפון (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text* text-648 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; אימייל (חובה)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[email* email-827 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt; תקציב להשקעה&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;[text text-214 30/ class:gg] &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label class=\"lastsub\"&gt; [submit class:gg \"שלח\"] &lt;/label&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried  with width, float, display:inline, etc, etc, but I think my problem is with HTML5.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","sql","database","wordpress"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13052971,"title":"integrating Databases in wordpress","body":"<p>I was wondering if you guys can help me out.\nWe are developing a new forum component on our website. \nThe forum is being created with PHP and MySQL and we want to integrate it with Wordpress.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem is, that we don't want to create a whole new Register Forum because this will force the user to create TWO accounts (one for the site and one for the forum) and this is not user friendly.</p>\n\n<p>So if you know a way to use the wordpress website user database with an outside database it will be great.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is to create a whole new data base but then we force the users out of the commenting section on the Wordpress website.

So I guess it has something to do with the usual processing of Ajax calls in wordpress which must go through the admin-ajax.php file in the wp-admin folder!? I am not sure how to cut this datatrans implementation into pieces to make it fit the wordpress Ajax processing. Furthermore I would like to know if you think that my guess is even right regarding what causes the error?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nTim</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","arrays","wordpress"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":34,"score":-1,"question_id":13050897,"title":"Retrieve value from PHP array - Taxonomy Custom Field","body":"<p>I have been trying to retrieve data from custom fields attatched to a Taxonomy in WordPress using the framework found at <a href=\"http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/taxonomy-meta-script-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/taxonomy-meta-script-for-wordpress/</a></p>\n\n<p>The data has been saved correctly but using their retrieval example I have still been unable to retrieve it, if i do the following....</p>\n\n<pre><code>$meta = get_option('first_section');\nif (empty($meta)) $meta = array();\nif (!is_array($meta)) $meta = (array) $meta;\n$meta = isset($meta['6']) ? $meta['6'] : array();\n$value = $meta['website'];\necho $value; // if you want to show\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't work, but if I do a var_dump on $meta = get_option('first_section'); I get this...</p>\n\n<pre><code>array(7) { [0]=&gt; bool(false) [11]=&gt; array(0) { } [9]=&gt; array(0) { } [7]=&gt; array(5) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(24) \"http://www.mydomain.com\" [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(33) \"https://twitter.com/mysite1\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(33) \"http://facebook.com/mysite1\" [\"googleplus\"]=&gt; string(79) \"https://plus.google.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"223\" } } [5]=&gt; array(6) { [\"address\"]=&gt; string(7) \"bbvbvvb\" [\"website\"]=&gt; string(35) \"http://www.mydomain.com/mysite\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"224\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite\" [\"googleplus\"]=&gt; string(79) \"https://plus.google.com\" } [6]=&gt; array(4) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(26) \"http://www.mysite4.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"225\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite4\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite4\" } [8]=&gt; array(4) { [\"website\"]=&gt; string(21) \"http://www.mysite5.com\" [\"image\"]=&gt; array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(3) \"226\" } [\"twitter\"]=&gt; string(30) \"https://twitter.com/mysite2\" [\"facebook\"]=&gt; string(30) \"http://facebook.com/mysite2\" } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I echo the <strong>'website'</strong> field from the array <strong>'6'</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the value I am trying to retrieve array(6) { [\"address\"]=> string(7) \"bbvbvvb\" [\"website\"]=> string(35) \"http://www.mydomain.com/mysite\"</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","permalinks","custom-taxonomy"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13048990,"title":"Include taxonomy slug in url?","body":"<p>I have the following custom post-type and custom taxonomy setup:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_action( 'init', 'create_post_type' );\nfunction create_post_type() {\n    register_post_type( 'system',\n        array(\n            'labels' =&gt; array(\n                'name' =&gt; __( 'Systems' ),\n                'singular_name' =&gt; __( 'System' )\n            ),\n        'capability_type' =&gt; 'post',\n        'supports' =&gt; array('title','editor','comments'),   \n        'public' =&gt; true,\n        'has_archive' =&gt; true,\n        'rewrite' =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'system' ),\n        )\n    );\n}\n\nfunction news_init() {\n    register_taxonomy(\n        'system',\n        'system',\n        array(\n            'label' =&gt; __( 'Product Category' ),\n            'sort' =&gt; true,\n            'hierarchical' =&gt; true,\n            'args' =&gt; array( 'orderby' =&gt; 'term_order' ),\n            'rewrite' =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'products' )\n        )\n    );  \n}\nadd_action( 'init', 'news_init' );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is it possible to include the custom taxonomy name in the URL?</p>\n\n<p>At present when I goto a custom post the URL looks like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.domain.com/products/(post-name)/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.domain.com/products/(post-name)/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can I make it look like the following?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.domain.com/(category-slug)/(post-name)/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.domain.com/(category-slug)/(post-name)/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've tried going to that URL but it just gives a 404.

I've been working on a shopping cart plugin for WordPress for quite a while now.  I started coding it at the end of 2008 (and it's been one of those \"work on it when I have time\" projects, so the going is very slow, obviously!) and got pretty far with it.  Even had a few testers take me up on it and give me feedback. (Please note that this plugin is also meant to be a fee download - I have no intention of making it a premium plugin.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in 2010, when all the PCI/DSS stuff became standard, I shelved it, because the plugin was meant to retain certain information in the database, and I was not 100% sure what qualified as \"sensitive data,\" and I didn't want to put anything out there that might compromise anyone, and possibly come back on me.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks, some colleagues and I have been having a discussion about PCI/DSS compliance, and it's sparked a re-interest in finally finishing this plugin.  I'm going to remove the storage of credit card numbers and any data of that nature, but I do like the idea of storing the names and shipping addresses of people who voluntarily might want to create an account with the site that might use this plugin so if they shop there again, that kind of info is retained. Keep in mind, the data stored would be <em>public information</em> - the kind of thing you'd find in a phone book, or a peek in the record room of a courthouse. So nothing like storing SS#'s, medical histories or credit card numbers. Just stuff that would maybe let someone see past purchases, and retain some info to make a future checkout process a bit easier.</p>\n\n<p>One of my colleagues suggested I still do something to enhance security a bit, since the name and shipping address would likely be passed to whatever payment gateway the site owner would choose to use. They suggested I use \"one-way encryption.\"  Now, I'm not a huge security freak, but I'm pretty sure this involves (one aspect anyway) stuff like MD5 hashes with salts, or the like.  So this confuses me, because I wouldn't have the slightest idea of where to look to see how to use that kind of thing with my code, and/or if it will work when passing that kind of data to PayPal or Google Checkout, or Mal's, or what have you.</p>\n\n<p>So I suppose this isn't an \"I need code examples\" kind of question, but more of a \"please enlighten me, because I'm sort of a dunce\" kind of question. (which, I'm sure, makes people feel much better about the fact that I'm writing a shopping cart plugin LOL)</p>\n"},{"tags":["html","css","wordpress"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":38,"score":-2,"question_id":13047365,"title":"Links not working","body":"<p>Can anyone see why my links in my header are not working for the home and contact us page.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rg3fitness.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rg3fitness.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Can't seem to see any problems with the code.

I was also able to prevent it from loading in the footer by commenting out line 35 in buddypress-activity-stream-bar/bp-activity-bar.php (not sure if that was the correct way to do it but it worked!)</p>\n\n<p>However now I have a new issue, which wasn't present when the activity bar was loading in the footer as a floating bar.</p>\n\n<p>When the page first loads, all 20 items that the activity bar cycles through are shown, in one vertical stack, see screenshot: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8mphgja\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/8mphgja</a></p>\n\n<p>Once the page finishes loading, it \"retracts\" and shows one line at a time like it's supposed to, see screenshot: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/93f7tou\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/93f7tou</a></p>\n\n<p>What can I do so that the list items stay hidden while the page is loading?</p>\n\n<p>==================================================================================</p>\n\n<h1>UPDATE #2</h1>\n\n<p>Okay, figured out that issue too, guess I should have just played around with it some more before posting my question :)</p>\n\n<p>To summarize just in case anyone else reads this that had the same problem I had, here is what I did from start to finish.</p>\n\n<p>I pasted the \"Rotate through activity\" code ( <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/0mfxYKCD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/0mfxYKCD</a> ) in my header.php before the closing head tag.</p>\n\n<p>Then I picked the location in my template where I wanted the activity bar to appear.  In my case, I wanted it to appear below my navigation on every page, so I pasted the \"Live Activity\" code ( <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/7bYseXc5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/7bYseXc5</a> ) at the end of my header.php file inside div tags.</p>\n\n<p>Then, to prevent all 20 items from showing when the page loads, I just had to define a max-height for my div container, so for example mine was:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.activity-bar\n{\nmax-height: 85px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally, since I didn't want the activity bar to appear in the footer as well (which is how it's supposed to work by default), I commented out line 35 in buddypress-activity-stream-bar/bp-activity-bar.php, so that the code isn't loaded in the footer.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that's how I manually inserted the \"Buddypress Activity Stream Bar\" into my theme.  Hope that helps someone else out! If anyone has any comments or suggestions on how to better accomplish this, please let me know! My one lingering concern is that if the plugin is updated, I will have to go back in and comment out the line that loads it in the footer again.  If anyone knows a way to prevent that, let me know, thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","jquery","wordpress","responsive-design"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":13021251,"title":"Which jQuery method should be used to load in a block of markup in this conditional css function?","body":"<p>I am using WordPress to <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/examples/ConditionalCSS/\" rel=\"nofollow\">load content conditionally</a> depending on the viewport size, but I need to replace the <code>load()</code> method with a more appropriate method.

Ft., Beds, Baths, Garage, Neighborhood, Acreage, Type, Price, etc.  It would be ideal if these items were always displayed and you could just type in the associated information with each into a field box.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a suggestion or recommendation on a plugin for something like this?  Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","wordpress-plugin"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13005177,"title":"Override WordPress [gallery] shortcode insertion with different name","body":"<p>Say you created your own Gallery plugin that uses it's own shortcode  (eg:  <strong>[my_gallery]</strong> )</p>\n\n<p>How would you go about modifying the default WordPress gallery shortcode insertion within the editor of [gallery] to [my_gallery] so that the client is not confused with having to remember the custom shortcode and accidentally making incorrect gallery insertions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13005360,"title":"Wordpress site loading issue","body":"<p>I am using WordPress WooCommerce for my client site and when I upload to server (using Plesk Panel) site is configured but cannot load properly specially <code>menu and slider part.</code></p>\n\n<p>Any idea, what might be issue?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://elegantkids.in.th/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Problem here</a></p>\n\n<p>Same source works perfectly over this <a href=\"http://kids.pspsolutions.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo server</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance !</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","title","custom-taxonomy"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13016516,"title":"Replacing the title of a post with a custom taxonomy on wordpress","body":"<p>Using filters/hooks, how would I replace the title of a wordpress post with whatever term has been selected from a custom taxonomy.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the attached image will explain what I'm trying to do.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7n6dr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Let's say I selected 'Powerchrono' - I would like the title of the post to be replaced with the selected term, and it's parent.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I'd obviously like the url of the post to also be updated too.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wordpress","nginx","robots.txt","php-fpm","sitemap.xml"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":1,"question_id":12822490,"title":"Nginx try_files won't trigger response from index.php","body":"<p>I'm having a problem with try_files not appearing to pass off requests for non-existent files to the last specified value, in my case index.php.

It is only used once and on this page. However, the problem with this is that the <code>custom_hook()</code> code is rendered on the page and that hook includes a bunch of markup. If the javascript determines that I'm using <code>A</code>, all that markup is on the page in the source code for no reason. I want to find a way to prevent the custom hook from rendering UNLESS it's being used in <code>B</code>.
