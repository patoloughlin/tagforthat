Is it okay do it this way? With the above code, I don't think we are modifying the port object.

There is no way around it other than one of the following:\n1) Use a more modern type of web service.\n2) Don't use a common DLL\n3) Manually fix every time you update the web reference, as in the original question above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","web-services","xml-parsing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":12947320,"title":"Java : Simple XML Serialization(simple-xml-2.6.6.jar) gives error with XML file containing <SOAP-ENV:Body> & <SOAP-ENV:Envelope>","body":"<p>I am using Simple XML Serialization(simple-xml-2.6.6.jar) <a href=\"http://simple.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> to convert my XML response from webservice to POJO class.\n XML is :</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema-instance\"&gt;\n      &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n         &lt;return&gt;\n           &lt;appointments&gt;\n             &lt;appointment&gt;\n               &lt;encounterId&gt;211707&lt;/encounterId&gt;\n               &lt;date&gt;2012-10-16&lt;/date&gt;\n               &lt;startTime&gt;00:00:00&lt;/startTime&gt;\n               &lt;ufname&gt;Sam&lt;/ufname&gt;\n               &lt;ulname&gt;Willis&lt;/ulname&gt;\n               &lt;reason&gt;Chest Congestion&lt;/reason&gt;\n               &lt;FacilityId&gt;2837&lt;/FacilityId&gt;\n               &lt;Notes/&gt;\n             &lt;/appointment&gt;\n          &lt;/appointments&gt;\n        &lt;/return&gt;\n      &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Appointments contains list of appointments.

In other words, the answer to \"Why haven't you done . . .\" is like to be, \"I don't know much about ....\"</p>\n\n<p>I am testing, and the System Under Test (SUT) is a web service calling into the Facebook API using <a href=\"https://graph.facebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://graph.facebook.com</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>I have a test server set up on a remote machine that will serve pages to <a href=\"http://graph.facebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://graph.facebook.com</a>.  I can use the hostfile on the SUT server to redirect requests to <a href=\"http://graph.facebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://graph.facebook.com</a> to the test server.  This works fine when I then type: </p>\n\n<pre><code>curl http://graph.facebook.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The test server receives the request, and serves back the expected page. </p>\n\n<p>However, as mentioned before, the SUT isn't using the HTTP site, but the HTTPS site for the Facebook API (naturally).  Is there any way I can intercept the outgoing request and redirect it to the HTTP service that I'm running on the other site?  I'd like to be able to type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl https://graph.facebook.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and have it be redirected to the fake Facebook service I'm running on the test server.  I can configure the servers at both ends.  </p>\n\n<p>If this is very difficult, I might also want to put in a feature request for the ability to change the URL for the Facebook API requests.  However, I think the dev is using a pre-existing Facebook API module, and this might not be straight-forward.  (Okay, I got curious and checked . . . a quick investigation suggests that the API supports data injection of the code that handles the actual HTTPS requests, so he'd have to implement his own version of the interface so that he could pass in a configurable URL that I could set from outside of the code - but I'd still rather not distract him unless it's really necessary).</p>\n\n<p>I'm using an <a href=\"https://github.com/seomoz/asis\" rel=\"nofollow\">asis-server</a> on port 80 to fake the Facebook responses, if that is relevant.</p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":12745759,"title":"webservice application in Demandware","body":"<p>I need to develope WAS application and should be hosted into Demandware platform.

Also, I'm expecting <code>result</code> to contain a response string but it too is returning a <code>null</code> value.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, I cannot modify the third-party C# client application. Is there anything I can do on the Java end?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>I recently added a handler chain class which is capturing and logging the raw SOAP messages.

Grape somehow retrieved Ivy, when I first started the script (I have no experience with Grape, but I suspect it's very similar to Maven).</p>\n\n<p>Then started my simple script: </p>\n\n<pre><code>@Grab(group='org.codehaus.groovy.modules', module='groovyws',version='0.5.2')\nimport groovyx.net.ws.WSClient\nproxy = new WSClient(\"http://127.0.0.1/axis2/services/ReleaseService?wsdl\", this.class.classLoader)\nproxy.initialize()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I couldn't even initialize the web client (without the Groovy Soap library in the classpath):</p>\n\n<pre><code>SEVERE: Could not compile java files for http://127.0.0.1/axis2/services/ReleaseService?wsdl.\nCaught: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to create JAXBContext for generated packages: Provider com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory could not be instantiated: javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: \"com.intershop.qa.tae.ws.xsd\" doesnt contain ObjectFactory.class or jaxb.index java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to create JAXBContext for generated packages: Provider com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory could not be instantiated [...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the Groovy Soap library (which seems to overload some of GroovyWS' functionality) in the classpath I've got: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Caught: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.wsdl.xml.WSDLReader.readWSDL(Ljavax/wsdl/xml/WSDLLocator;Lorg/w3c/dom/Element;)Ljavax/wsdl/Definition; java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which looks very similar to the error I've got when I was using Groovy Soap in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>So my question is:</em></strong> How can I communicate with an Axis2 web service using <code>complexType</code> parameters via ANT. I'm not limited to Groovy only, but for deployment reasons (~50 VM snapshots) I want something simple. A Java client worked, but since the deployment is quite some effort (especially if I want to change stuff in the future) I need something which is closer to ANT and easier to deploy.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for suggestions of other technologies or fix ideas for my GroovyWS implementation.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wcf","web-services","soap","soapheader","endpointbehavior"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":1,"question_id":13222300,"title":"WCF message: protocol in To element changes","body":"<p>I have a WCF service to consume in .NET.

All of the\ncapabilities offered by a service inventory are expected to utilize\nother services within that inventory, where necessary, in order to\nbuild the task that they are accomplishing from smaller component\nparts. This is all from an architectural level, though: how does this\ncomposition happen at the implementation level?</p>\n\n<p>Consider this situation. I have a \"task service\" which involves\nposting a <code>/process-request</code> resource that will manage additional\nresources involved in asynchronously processing a large file to\ngenerate the \"real\" resource.  Let's call the eventual \"real\" resource\na PartsInventory.  So, you provide a URL and a name for the\nPartsInventory to the <code>/process-request</code> service, which then creates\na PartsInventory \"placeholder\" and kicks off the asynchronous ETL\ninvolved in converting the massive csv file at your URL into a real\nPartsInventory.  If this asynchronous job fails, it will remove the\nplaceholder and queries to the <code>/process-request</code> service will\nreflect the failure.  If it succeeds, it will remove the placeholder\nstatus and queries to the <code>/process-request</code> service will instead\nredirect you to the PartsInventory resource.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how does the implementation of the interaction between\n<code>/process-request</code> and the PartsInventory <em>look</em>, from a code\nstandpoint?  Am I POSTing requests to a published <code>/parts-inventory</code>\nservice, or am I calling ORM objects to create the placeholder?  If\nthe former, I am abiding by the published contract and am behaving as\na consumer of my own services, which seems to fit the composability\nprinciple--but it feels really awkward to interact this way from\nwithin the same codebase. On the other hand, the latter presumes that\nthe <code>/process-request</code> handler is going to know about how to create\na PartsInventory placeholder on its own, which feels awkward in\nitself. The third option would be to create a specialized static\nfactory method on the PartsInventory object, called something along\nthe lines of <code>PartsInventory.create_placeholder()</code>, so that the\n<code>/process-request</code> code is at least ignorant of the constructor\ndependencies of a PartsInventory object. This does still separate\ncreation into two locations, though.</p>\n\n<p>Have you encountered this? Is there a canonical \"right answer\" to this\nquestion?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","web-services","testing","visual-studio-2012"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":13218807,"title":"webtest takes only the first item from the datasource","body":"<p>I have created <code>webtest</code> in vs2012</p>\n\n<p>I want it to call a web-service with query string.</p>\n\n<p>I want to assign new value to the query-string from a pool of values (aka data source)</p>\n\n<p>I followed this tutorial</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perftesting.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=How%20To:%20Use%20Data%20Binding%20in%20Load%20Tests%20in%20Microsoft%20Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://perftesting.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=How%20To:%20Use%20Data%20Binding%20in%20Load%20Tests%20in%20Microsoft%20Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System</a></p>\n\n<p>and have created a csv data source and attached it to the <code>id</code> query string parameter.</p>\n\n<p>However all the generated requests use the first item in the data source only.</p>\n\n<p>(I have created a for loop)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/WDi1t.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>How can I solve this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","web-services","testing","visual-studio-2012"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":0,"question_id":13218401,"title":"how to add coded Web performance test to a load test in visual studio 2012","body":"<p>I wrote a <code>webtest</code> that calls a web-service with query-string.</p>\n\n<p>I want to create a load-test that will execute this webtest ith different query-string on every request (from pre-definied values pool).</p>\n\n<p>I didn't manage to do it with the regualt <code>webtest</code> file (anyone knows how?)</p>\n\n<p>So I converted this <code>webtest</code> to <code>coded WPT</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I edited the code and it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>public class KnownCtidsTest : WebTest\n    {</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public List&lt;string&gt;

So everything is going good so far.</p>\n\n<p>But I have a little problem, I need every service call to check if the user is loged in and if he has the permission to call that service, for example:</p>\n\n<p>Im going to have an extra service on my UsuarioFacadeREST called logIn() that receive a user, password, and if is it correct, im going to add a \"logedIn:true\" parametter to his HTTPSession so i can always know if he has already loged in, something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@GET\n@Path(\"login/{user}/{pass}\")\n@Produces({\"application/xml\"})\npublic String logIn(@PathParam(\"user\") String user, @PathParam(\"pass\") String pass, @Context HttpServletRequest request) {\n    Usuario userEntity;\n    if( (userEntity = getUserFromDB(user, pass)) != null ) {\n        HttpSession session = request.getSession();\n        session.setAttribute(\"logedIn\", true);\n        session.setAttribute(\"priviledges\", loadPrivilegdesList(userEntity));\n        return \"&lt;logedIn&gt;true&lt;/logedIn&gt;\";\n    } else {\n        return \"&lt;logedIn&gt;false&lt;/logedIn&gt;\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, once he has loged in, I load his priviledges list on his session.</p>\n\n<p>These privilegdes are Strings like \"VIEW_CUSTOMER_LIST\", \"ADD_CUSTOMER\", \"EDIT_CUSTOMER\", \"DELETE_CUSTOMER\", \"ADD_PRODUCT\", \"EDIT_PRODUCT\", etc, etc.</p>\n\n<p>What does this means? this means that on my CustomerFacadeREST service, for every REST service(every function call), i will nedd to check the user loggedIn status and his privilegdes list. By this way i will be able to know if i can offer the user this service or i have to deny it to him.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that i think is not a good practice to edit all the autogenerated RESTful Web Services to check in every function if the HttpSession has the attribute logedIn.</p>\n\n<p>So, i wish to know if is there any way to have a pre-service-call function for all the RESTful web services that check, on every service call, befor call it, the logedIn attribute of the HttpSession.

This is the case though, and my phpinfo() from both servers shows that output_buffering and output_compression are turned off.</p>\n\n<p>We're certainly on the right track.

I read this <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dd819156%28v=office.12%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> but I don't like the result, because the content of the worksheet is written in the .Net code. The solution I'd prefer would be some kind of <b>data provider</b>, which can be used directly in the excel sheet, similar to reading data directly from a table.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to achieve that?</p>\n\n<p><b>Edit</b><br />\nBecause of the first comments and answers. Consider as data transformation e.g. a conversion from ticks (<code>long</code>) to <code>DateTime</code>. I've to do it in .net, because the result depends on the target time zone.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","web-services","concurrency","threadpool","executorservice"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1564,"score":1,"question_id":323945,"title":"Can a java fixedThreadPool be used by multiple threads","body":"<p>I have a webservice that does multiple small calculations before returning the result.

Searching the Internet hasn't really yielded much results, everyone has a different way and different process usually geared towards their own Web Service making it a one time use type of solution. Basically, below is the response that I get from a Web Service</p>\n\n<pre><code>anyType{\n schema=anyType{\n  element=anyType{\n   complexType=anyType{\n    choice=anyType{\n     element=anyType{\n      complexType=anyType{\n       sequence=anyType{\n        element=anyType{}; \n           element=anyType{}; \n            element=anyType{}; \n              element=anyType{}; }; }; }; }; }; }; };   \n      diffgram=anyType{\n         NewDataSet=anyType{\n          Rep_x0020_Information=anyType{\n            Login=CorrectLogin; Password=InCorrectPass; }; }; }; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And basically I want to be able to parse out just the two important fields (Login and Password). From what I read I tried just iterating through the SoapObject response based on the property count but that doesn't seem to work. When I tried I get a property count of 2 for the response so instead I ended up doing some thing like this below: </p>\n\n<pre><code>SoapObject response=(SoapObject) envelope.getResponse();\n\n                if  (response != null) {\n                    Log.i(\"Message\", \"the response contains: \" + response.toString());\n                    SoapObject diffgram = (SoapObject) response.getProperty(\"diffgram\");\n                    SoapObject NewDataSet = (SoapObject) diffgram.getProperty(\"NewDataSet\");\n                    SoapObject RepInfo = (SoapObject) NewDataSet.getProperty(\"Rep_x0020_Information\");\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; RepInfo.getPropertyCount(); i++) {\n                        PropertyInfo info = new PropertyInfo();\n                        RepInfo.getPropertyInfo(i, info);\n                        Log.d(\"Info\", info.name + \" : \" + RepInfo.getProperty(i).toString());\n                    }\n\n\n //which gives the following message in LogCat\n  D/Info(716): Login : InCorrectLogin\n  D/Info(716): Password : InCorrectPass\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This process works, as by the last loop I get the two objects I want but I just feel like there's a cleaner way of doing this. I only ask because as I get further into this App there will be some more complex Web Service calls being made and I want to be able to have something that is reusable throughout the app instead of having to build several SoapObjects for each request just to get down to the objects I want. </p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","design-patterns","wsdl"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13120467,"title":"is it ok to combine multiple functions to a single operation in wsdl?","body":"<p>Is there a \"rule\" for this?

For example SetRecord-operation: if id is specified for some kind of record the operation updates the record otherwise the operation creates the record. In this case return message would tell if insert or update was made, but would this be bad design (and if it is, why)?</p>\n\n<p>Another example would be that there's contains-hierarchy of records and sometimes it's wanted to create all levels of hiearchy, sometimes 2 levels and sometime only 1.

And whilst it all makes good sense in theory, I have been scouring the web to find a single good example of some client code that follows the idea strictly.</p>\n\n<p>The more I read, the more I'm starting to feel like this is an academic discussion because no-one is actually doing it!  People can moan all they like about the WS-* stack's many flaws but at least it is clear how to write clients: you can parse WSDL and generate code.  </p>\n\n<p>Now I understand that this should not be necessary with a good RESTful service: you should only need to know about the relationships and representations involved and you should be able to react dynamically to those.  But even still, shouldn't this principle have been distilled and abstracted into some common libraries by now?  Feed in information about the representations and relationships you might receive and get some more useful higher level code you can use in your application?</p>\n\n<p>These are just half-baked ideas of mine really, but I'm just wary that if I dive in and write a properly RESTful API right now, no-one is actually going to be able to use it! Or at least using it is going to be such a pain in the behind because of the extra mile people will have to go writing glue code to interpret the relationships and representations I provide.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed any light on this from the client perspective?  Can someone show an example of properly dynamic/reactive RESTful client code so that I can have an idea of the audience I'm actually writing for?  (better still an example of a client API that provides some abstractions)  Otherwise its all pretty theoretical....</p>\n\n<p>[edit: note, I've found a similar question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180528/rest-client-implementation-embracing-hateoas-constraint\">here</a>, which I don't think was really answered, the author was palmed off with a Wikipedia stub!] </p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","netbeans","platform"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4484,"score":2,"question_id":470098,"title":"Consuming a web service with the Netbeans Platform","body":"<p>I have an application that is written with the NetBeans Platform 5.5.

Richardson, where he describes the Resource Oriented Architecture to be a more standard way to apply REST (since it's not a standard).</p>\n\n<p>By the way a thing is obvious in RESTful webservice, URIs must be unique.\nSo why giants like Google or Twitter are designing REST webservices violating this rule?</p>\n\n<p>They all developed webservices like you are the only user for the system... if you want to get all your resources you simply perform a <code>GET /resources</code>.</p>\n\n<p>IMHO this is not self-descriptive, because a developer (both purist -expert- or a rookie) might assume that this is not related to any user or that may return the whole list of resources (for all users), and people must carefully read the documentation. The right thing (according to ROA) is: design all resources strictly related to another resource to be nested.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want to get all of your resources you should perform <code>GET /user/:user_id/resources</code>, this is more descriptive, is telling what you are expecting for and makes URIs unique...</p>\n\n<p>This also allow to think in a more dynamic way to share permissions, because if you want to access someone's resource (supposing there's a way he gave you permissions to access that resource) you would simply need to query the service with his <code>user_id</code> with your credentials and you would be done, otherwise you need to know his credentials because for the system there's nobody else but you.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that simply requiring <code>GET /resources</code> may be simpler for service provider because you have all your data inside the request body, and for client engineers because you don't need to create URIs with your user_id, but I think for a developer it would be very imperceptible to create the right URI (today's HTTP libraries are very easy to use and to authenticate you must know your credentials both using HMAC or PKI).</p>\n\n<p>From my point of view it also remember the service provider to recognize what resources he's working with, especially in a SOA where you need to retrieve data from multiple independent services, in that case a Resource, but that's related to a User (so you may also need to retrieve the user resource for internal purposes).</p>\n\n<p>And not to forget that a self-descriptive service requires less use of documentation (making 3rd parties happy and faster) and requires less technical support, allowing the company to focus better on new products and features rather than support tons of requests for what has been actually build.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think of this reflection?

This doesnt work for service referenec) How do I go about configuring this at runtime?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","rest","tomcat","classnotfoundexception"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5416,"score":5,"question_id":8444107,"title":"ClassNotFoundException when starting tomcat","body":"<p>I'm trying to make a Webservice REST.\nAfter some hours to find how can i solve the problem... </p>\n\n<p>My project looks like :</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/12B1E.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The traceback is :</p>\n\n<pre><code>8 déc. 2011 18:31:36 org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init\nINFO: The Apache Tomcat Native library which allows optimal performance in production     environments was not found on the java.library.path: C:\\Program Files\\MyEclipse\\Common\\binary\\com.sun.java.jdk.win32.x86_1.6.0.013\\bin;C:\\Program Files\\MyEclipse\\Common\\plugins\\com.genuitec.eclipse.easie.tomcat.myeclipse_9.0.0.me201109141806\\tomcat\\bin\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:36 org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol init\nINFO: Initialisation de Coyote HTTP/1.1 sur http-8080\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:36 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina load\nINFO: Initialization processed in 394 ms\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:37 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService start\nINFO: Démarrage du service Catalina\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:37 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine start\nINFO: Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/6.0.13\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:37 org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR\nINFO: Déploiement de l'archive Test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war de l'application web\n8 déc. 2011 18:31:37 org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader validateJarFile\nINFO: validateJarFile(C:\\Documents and Settings\\Naya\\Workspaces\\MyEclipse 10\\.metadata\\.me_tcat\\webapps\\Test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\\WEB-INF\\lib\\javax.servlet-3.0.1.jar) - jar not loaded.

If so, then when &amp; where should I use it?</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps 2 years ago, I was soo ignorant, that we used some kind of old version of asmx and we moved to new asmx.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

I used this and the CIE URL to get rates, print shipping labels, etc.  So far so good.  Everything works.  I have been able to build and test desktop and web GUIs that use UPS API.</p>\n\n<p>Now I understand that I need to implement UPS Registration API and Licensing API to apply for certification.  I applied with UPS for this and received the API package.  Again, so far so good.  Now, I have two questions:</p>\n\n<p>1- I understand that we can use the Registration API to authenticate existing UPS accounts for end users to access my application.  We can also use it to allow the end user to create one or more new UPS accounts for use with the application.  If Registration API takes care of this, what is the use of the Licensing API?  UPS documentation isn't widely available and the documentation that comes with the API kit is very minimal.</p>\n\n<p>2- My app will use the end users' UPS account numbers for shipping, but which Access Key should it use?  Should it use the Access Key of each end user, or my Access Key for everyone?  If the former, then should this end-user Access Key be obtained using the Licensing API?  Is that the Licensign API's purpose?</p>\n\n<p>In essence, I think both questions are the same but you can see how perplexed I am with respect to this requirement of implementing Registration and Licensing APIs!</p>\n\n<p>Any insight from you experts would be REALLY great!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nJust wanted to add another question: </p>\n\n<p>3- I am using UPS Web Services for all UPS functionality.  The package that contains Licensing API and Registration API has a \"Reference.cs\" for the Registration API but not for Licensing API (only XSDs in that folder).  Is the Licensing API not available as Web Service?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","api","weather"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13090878,"title":"Is there any API that offer information on current pollen/allergies information in USA?","body":"<p>I'm looking for something like the NOAA web services (http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/) but for allergies.

The Android app is a forum reader that should display a list of threads in a forum and allow users to read the threads. The app merely contacts the webservice in the background and basically asks \"give me the posts in thread x\". The webservice then connects to the forum, downloads the HTML source code, parses it, and finally returns (in json format) the relevant information (each post along with the author, date, message, etc). The Android app then receives that information and displays it nicely.</p>\n\n<p>In this way the webservice does all the 'dirty work' (downloading the forum HTML source, parsing it and extracting the relevant information), while the Android app merely sits back and receives the information it wants.</p>\n\n<p>However, in order for the webservice to access the forum and its page source, the user must be authenticated. I can give the webservice access to the forum by doing a HTTP POST with the username and password to the login page of the forum, and storing the CookieContainer it receives when successfull. Then I use that same CookieContainer object in all further requests, which is enough to authenticate the user and allow access to the threads and their page source.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious downside is that any users beside myself will have to enter their password in the Android app, which would have to send it to the webservice, which finally uses it to authenticate the user. The webservice needs the password in plain text obviously, hence it cannot receive a hashed version. I can of course encrypt the password or use HTTPS, but the fact remains that this way I require the plaintext password on the webservice, where I could potentially store it and steal passwords. Obviously not the best method.</p>\n\n<p>The only alternative I can think about is doing the login work on the Android app itself, receive the CookieContainer there (I guess there must be something similar in Java?), and send that cookie information to the webservice instead. This would still allow 'hackers' to impersonate themselves as another user by intercepting the data, but as far as I can see it's no less secure then people simply logging on to the forum via the Android webbrowser. The obvious advantage is that I no longer need the plaintext password on the webservice site, the Android app does not need to send it to me (only to the (https) login page, same as if they used the browser directly) and there is no way for it to get intercepted or for me to steal it.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short: I want to receive cookies from a webrequest in Java (the Android app), and somehow transfer them to a webservice (ASP.NET) where I can rebuild the CookieContainer object and use it for further requests. I must therefore somehow translate the cookies I get in Java to string(s), and send them to the webservice, where I rebuild a CookieContainer object out of those strings. </p>\n\n<p>I tried some basic approaches but I'm getting nowhere. Can anyone assist me with this step?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, in the ASP.NET webservice, I create a new CookieContainer object and use it as the CookieContainer property of the HttpWebRequest object. Then I execute a HTTP POST request to the login page, and if successfull that same CookieContainer object can be used to authenticate any further requests. I have to rewrite this basically in Java, only instead of using the CookieContainer directly (or whatever the equivalent is in Java), I need to convert it to a string so I can send it to the webservice, where I can rebuild the CookieContainer from the string.</p>\n\n<p>Any hints?

The second constructs a char array the same length of the content and then reads individual bytes from the stream and casts them to chars. </p>\n\n<p>The issue comes into play when, as shown, I attempt to run the .NET client with multiple requests in one execution. The first request goes off without any sort of discernible issue. When the second one comes in, the server reads the headers, gets the content length and constructs the array. When it comes time to read from the socket, however, the program just waits. Using the char array method, I was able to learn that it waits when reading the first value. Once one minute has expired, .NET times out, and the rest of the program breaks. </p>\n\n<p>If, however, I leave the server running, and only have one request per execution of the .NET client, everything is just fine; the response comes back just as it should. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried some solutions already:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a new MathServiceWSDLClient for every request</li>\n<li>Putting every request in its own using() block.</li>\n<li>Doing two of the same request at once: two Multiply() or Add() requests. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.

It says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The name attribute of the input and output elements provides a unique\n  name among all input and output elements within the enclosing port\n  type.  In order to avoid having to name each input and output element\n  within an operation, WSDL provides some default values based on the\n  operation name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In order to avoid naming each input/output elements, WSDL provides defaults. But why is that a RULE? Shouldn't it be a warning? \nCan't the developer provide the names by him/herself if he/she wants to? </p>\n\n<p>Further, I don't understand why this is a problem, since when the clients invoke the web service, they invoke with specific operation names called 'add' or 'subtract'. \nMy question finally is - As long as the operation names are different why should the parameter names matter? \nCan some one please explain the consequences of having the WSDL like this, if any ? </p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","email","rest","service","cloud"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":539,"score":3,"question_id":6511412,"title":"Email Parsing Cloud Service","body":"<p>I was looking for a cloud email service that offered the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Garauntee deliveribility of emails </li>\n<li>Have the ability to parse an email and post accordingly to a HTTP endpoint</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I swear I had seen a service like this, but I can't seem to relocate it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any chance somebody knows of any other services that fit my description?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I found a service called mailgun, but it doesn't do email parsing.

This indicates to me that the custom token is never being sent across the wire. I assume this is because the call to CreateSecurityTokenProvider() never returned my custom token provider, since the SecurityTokenRequirement is never passed in indicating my custom token is needed.</p>\n\n<p>On the client side, I have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CentralAuthorizationManagerClient : ClientBase&lt;ICentralAuthorizationManager&gt;, ICentralAuthorizationManager, IDisposable\n{\n\tpublic PFPrincipal GenerateToken()\n\t{\n\t\tif (!this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Contains(typeof(CentralAuthCredentials)))\n\t\t\tthrow new ArgumentException(\"Must set CentralAuthCredentials before calling this method.\");\n\t\treturn base.Channel.GenerateToken();\n\t}\n\n\tpublic PFPrincipal GenerateToken(CentralAuthToken token)\n\t{\n\t\tthis.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Remove&lt;ClientCredentials&gt;();\n\t\tthis.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new CentralAuthCredentials(token));\n\t\treturn this.GenerateToken();\n\t}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These methods are basically supposed to remove the default credentials from the endpoint and attach a new instance of my custom CentralAuthCredentials. (I grabbed this Remove/Add combo from an MSDN article somewhere).</p>\n\n<p>In the configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\t&lt;behaviors&gt;\n\t\t&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;behavior name=\"Server2ServerEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;clientCredentials type=\"MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;clientCertificate findValue=\"localhost\" x509FindType=\"FindBySubjectName\" storeLocation=\"CurrentUser\" storeName=\"My\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;serviceCertificate&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;authentication certificateValidationMode=\"None\" revocationMode=\"NoCheck\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;/serviceCertificate&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/clientCredentials&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/behavior&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;\n\t&lt;/behaviors&gt;\n\n\t&lt;bindings&gt;\n\t\t&lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;binding name=\"wsHttpServer2Server\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;security mode=\"Message\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;message clientCredentialType=\"UserName\" /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/security&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/binding&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/wsHttpBinding&gt;\n\t&lt;/bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the behavior's clientCredentials type is set to my custom client credentials. However, at the moment I still have the binding's clientCredentialType set to \"UserName\". This brings up my <strong>2nd question</strong>: What the heck should clientCredentialType=\"?\" be set to if I'm using custom credentials? According to MSDN, the available values for <em>Message</em> security are: <em>None</em>, <em>Windows</em>, <em>UserName</em>, <em>Certificate</em>, and <em>IssuedToken</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? Hopefully I'm just missing something simple?  There are like 6 more classes to the entire implementation, but I tried to only include the bits needed to understand the situation...</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've been working on this all day, and thanks to a few sources, I realized that part of what I was missing was the very last step on <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731872.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, which is adding the TokenParameters to the binding, so that the binding knows what the token looks like. That is the answer to my original 1st question; \"what the heck sets up the token requirements?\" Answer: the TokenParameters assigned to the binding.</p>\n\n<p>So now I added the following extension which sets the TokenParameters on the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public sealed class CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension : BindingElementExtensionElement\n{\n\tpublic CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension()\n\t\t: base()\n\t{\n\t}\n\n\tpublic override Type BindingElementType\n\t{\n\t\tget { return typeof(SymmetricSecurityBindingElement); }\n\t}\n\n\tprotected override System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement CreateBindingElement()\n\t{\n\t\tX509SecurityTokenParameters protectionParams = new X509SecurityTokenParameters();\n\t\tprotectionParams.InclusionMode = SecurityTokenInclusionMode.Never;\n\n\t\tSymmetricSecurityBindingElement innerBindingElement = new SymmetricSecurityBindingElement();\n\t\tinnerBindingElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SignedEncrypted.Add(new CentralAuthTokenParameters());\n\t\t//innerBindingElement.MessageProtectionOrder = MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt;\n\t\tinnerBindingElement.ProtectionTokenParameters = protectionParams;\n\n\t\treturn innerBindingElement;\n\t}\n}\n\n\t&lt;extensions&gt;\n\t\t&lt;bindingElementExtensions&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;add name=\"CentralAuthCreds\" type=\"MyApp.Security.Configuration.CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension, MyApp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/bindingElementExtensions&gt;\n\t&lt;/extensions&gt;\n\n\t&lt;bindings&gt;\n\t\t&lt;customBinding&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;binding name=\"wsHttpServer2Server\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;CentralAuthCreds /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;binaryMessageEncoding /&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;httpTransport /&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/binding&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/customBinding&gt;\n\t&lt;/bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well that gets me a step further. Now I get a new exception on the server: </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"The security token manager cannot create a token authenticator for requirement ...\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like WCF is using some default token manager to try to deal with my custom token, instead of my custom token handler (my custom token handler's constructor is never called).  I <em>think</em> this is happening because for the <em>client</em>, I have this config:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;\n    &lt;behavior name=\"Server2ServerEndpointBehavior\"&gt;\n        &lt;clientCredentials type=\"MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But on the <em>server</em> I don't have any equivalent to let it know about the custom client credentials. So, <strong>new question</strong>: Where in the config for the server do I tell it what the custom ClientCredentials are?</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I finally figured out a bit more of the puzzle.  I had only implemented a ClientCredentials implementation, thinking that the client sends creds, and thats it. The client doesnt authenticate the service, so I don't need custom ServiceCredentials.  Well, I was wrong. The specified ServiceCredentials authenticates the token from the ClientCredentials, and vice-versa. So I just had to add a custom ServiceCredentials implementation that passed the same TokenSerializer and TokenAuthenticator classes.</p>\n\n<p>On to the next issue: WCF is now ignoring my x509 certs specified in config that were working fine with UserName auth.  I'm going to open a whole new question for this one!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","wcf","web-services"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":0,"question_id":12930531,"title":"Hosting a WCF service using Window Service using a non-local host domain","body":"<p>I would like to host internet based net-tcp WCF service through window service rather than IIS?\nWhat I want to know is, is it possible for the end point URI to be something other than non-localhost domain based URI.\nSo for e.g. I would like to access the service at <code>&lt;http://dev1/myservice&gt;</code> rather than a standard <code>&lt;http://localhost:90/myservice</code>> which is what almost all the documented examples mention.\nIs what I'm trying to do even possible with hosting using a window service in mind (obviously with IIS hosting, I know it's possible)</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","web-services"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":12930708,"title":"Adding a web service reference with parameters to a dll","body":"<p>I followed the instructions found on the link : [How to add a web service reference in a dll][1]</p>\n\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2247798/how-to-add-a-web-service-reference-in-a-dll\">How to add a web service reference in a DLL</a> and I managed to test that my web service works in my console application.

It seems I now have a problem where if I use a custom binding in my .NET4 web service, then my methods that implement the web service WebInvoke contracts are no longer getting called when they contain the argument of the request body Stream.</p>\n\n<p>So here's code that runs the webservice as found from the the link above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>webserviceHost = new WebServiceHost(typeof(Service1), new Uri(\"http://localhost:8080));\nwebserviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IService), getBinding(), \"webservice\").Behaviors.Add(new WebHttpBehavior());\nwebserviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(new ServiceMetadataBehavior { HttpGetEnabled = true });\nwebserviceHost.Open();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the WebInvoke service contract defined:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[WebInvoke(UriTemplate = \"import_data?param={value}\", Method = \"POST\", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\nWebResult importOrder(string value, Stream httpRequestPostBody);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's the method implementing the above contract:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public WebResult importOrder(String value, Stream httpRequestPostBody)\n{\n    doSomething(value, httpRequestPostBody);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if I try making a HTTP request through Fiddler to the webservice endpoint contract it will return a connection reset HTTP error response. If I remove the Stream httpRequestPostBody argument then it will run the method, but I have no way to get access to the raw JSON data in the request body (I can get the body but its in an XML form). So I can only gather that I'm missing something in my custom binding to ensure that the body stream of the request can be passed.

If the client is a web page with JavaScript, it seems like the client should use <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, but it is not clear to me how to get that object to use the file the user selected with the file input control.</p>\n\n<p>I would love for the same API to work both with manually operated web forms (for easy UI and testing), and purely programmatic invocation (like with JavaScript, curl/libcurl, etc.). I don't want the PHP to issue a redirect to another page with the ID in the query string, and I don't want to return HTML directly. I just want a simple file in, ID out API.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is proving difficult I suspect I am going about things the wrong way. I am open to alternative designs, but I would prefer to keep things as simple as possible.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke(Method = \"GET\", UriTemplate = \"/PutMessage/{jsonString}\", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\nstring PutMessage(string jsonString);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I call http:///MyWebService/PutMessage/{MyJsonString} I get passed on the the method, and all is well (more or less).</p>\n\n<p>But then what does it mean when I define this as a <strong>POST</strong> instead?</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke(Method = \"POST\", UriTemplate = \"/PutMessage/{jsonString}\", BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]\nstring PutMessage(string jsonString);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>What does the UriTemplate do here?</strong> If I do a POST, I expect the data to be contained not in the URI, but in the \"data section\" of the post. But do I define the variable name in the data section? How does the WebServiceHost/.NET know that what is contained in the \"data section\" of the post is to be put into the variable jsonString? How do I post the data from the client side (not C#, let's say JQuery instead) so that it is interpreted correctly on the serer side?</p>\n\n<p>(And how does the WebMessageFormat affet things? I have read everywhere about this (MSDN, Stackoverflow etc) but haven't found a clear and good answer.)</p>\n\n<h1>Question 2:</h1>\n\n<p>In my attempts to understand this, I thought I'd make a very simple POST-method, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[OperationContract]\n[WebInvoke]\nstring PutJSONRequest(string pc);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then <em>try</em> call this method using Fiddler, but that does not work at all.

This allowed me to pass the expected message as concatenation of the two parts expected (or any other message for that matter, as no message defined structure WSDL check is being done by SoapVar on the returned value):</p>\n\n<pre><code>$xml1 = new SimpleXMLElement('&lt;cdhead/&gt;');\n$xml1 -&gt; addAttribute ('xmlns', 'http://pse/');\n$xml1 -&gt; addAttribute ('cisprik', $newCisprik);\n\n$xml2 = new SimpleXMLElement('&lt;mvts/&gt;');\n\n$rows = mysql_query('select * from trx');\nwhile($data = mysql_fetch_assoc($rows)) {\n    $mvts_S = $xml2 -&gt; addChild('mvts_S'); \n    foreach($data as $key =&gt; $value) {\n        if ($key == 'att') { $mvts_S -&gt; addAttribute($key, $value);}\n        else    {$mvts_S -&gt; addChild($key, $value);}\n    }\n};\n\n$dom1 = dom_import_simplexml ($xml1) -&gt; ownerDocument;\n$dom2 = dom_import_simplexml ($xml2) -&gt; ownerDocument;\n$part1 = $dom1 -&gt; saveXML($dom1 -&gt; documentElement);\n$part2 = $dom2 -&gt; saveXML($dom2 -&gt; documentElement);\n\n$result = new SoapVar ($part1 . $part2, XSD_ANYXML);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Peculiar about this is that the concatenation is not valid XML of course, lacking the surrounding root element, but SoapVar is able to parse it anyhow.</p>\n\n<p>So there it is: can anyone with detailed insight in SoapVar and SoapParam / SoapServer explain whether it is at all possible to return two message parts?<br>\nAnd explain how to do so?<br>\nOr, alternatively, supply detailed information on how to do so in other SOAP setups?</p>\n"},{"tags":["web-services","rest","service","discovery"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2386,"score":6,"question_id":1789856,"title":"How do I discover RESTful Web services?","body":"<p>When I want to find a \"Big\" Web service (WS-*/WSDL based) of required functionality I can simply google for \".... filetype:wsdl\" because Google indexes also WSDL definitions.

This is my first question and hope the only such big and abstract.</p>\n\n<p>The question is <strong>should I focus on WebSharper for web development (sites, services), or go with C#/plain F# and ASP.NET MVC/ServiceStack/TypeScript/something else</strong>. The main criterium is time to a working (although probably not production-ready), tracer-bullet solution that could scale in principle (that is, it will not require a complete re-write or unreasonable $$ if suddenly need to scale) so that I could continue to bootstrap my projects as long and as fast as I can.</p>\n\n<p>I have read all questions on Web# at SO and googled a lot, just to become more uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>I started to learn F# recently and am very excited because this language really makes a huge difference for my main project (data-rich caclualtion-heavy engine) compared to C# due to all the lauded features of F#. Therefore I have already decided to invest my time in the language itself.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the engine, I need a user web-interface, web-service and I also have another project which is a social web-site. For these, I am considering Websharper but cannot find enough data to decide for Web# over more traditional approaches, mainly ServiceStack-powered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros for Web# and F# as a single languages for most purposes:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Single language for all purposes, hoping that F# is the next big\nthing and tooling/rich IDE support will come soon (ReSharper like)</li>\n<li>Web# <em>looks</em> great, productive, logical and +-well documented</li>\n<li>By using Web# I will better and faster learn F# for really hard things</li>\n<li>Interactive F# is great for prototyping and idea development - this\nis probably true for web development as well</li>\n<li>WebShaper usage is promoted in the book Expert F# 2.0/3.0 and the book adds to Web# documentation, however CEO of Web#'s parent IntelliFactory is a co-author of the book, and that explains why Web# is endorsed in the book. Web# could be really good and the promotion be well-deserved, but a second thought about conflcit of interests lights up.</li>\n<li>The fact that you are using F# code from both server and client side allows for transparent transfer of data (using the same types for both client and server-side code), no manual wiring involved.</li>\n<li>You could use the exact same code for validation on the server and client side.</li>\n<li>Building markup dynamically on the client side is just as simple and allows you to only have to transfer data over the wire.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Very limited real-world examples of Web# sites </li>\n<li>Poor tooling/IDE support compared to C# </li>\n<li>Less flexibility, limiting myself to a specific way to do\nthings and to existing extensions</li>\n<li>ServiceStack offers already implemented proven patterns and has a\nsolid architechture (e.g. I definetly need DTOs over chatty web-apis\nfor connecting desktop clients to the server calculation engine)</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TypeScript</a> brings static typing and great tooling support for\nJavaScript and solves a lot of problems I had with developping and\nmaintaining JS scripts.

Type inference in TypeScript smells like F#, it is very intuitive and I feel that I already know it. Will WebSharper save me time in the long term and is it flexible enough to do almost anything a data-rich user web-interface or a social site could require?</strong> Or ServiceStack + Backbone.js + ... + TypeScript (or some other combination of technologies) will do better?</p>\n"}]}
