Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>\n\n<p>@Mike Stone</p>\n\n<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>\n\n<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The \"correct\" way to do this in Java is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new(\"\")\nfor(String s : stuff) {\n  result.append(s);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Though my Java is a bit rusty.</p>\n\n<p>@Mike Stone #2:\nWhoah!!!!! How did I miss that in the API?  I'm still not sure of the performance of StringIO, but at least it's now \"Ruby's\" problem, not mine :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","string","parsing","text","multiple"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13275203,"title":"Find string VB.NET","body":"<p>I have a text file with multiple different items that I need to grab from it. </p>\n\n<p>Here is portion of the text file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>JOB_NUMBER                      XXXX-XX              TYPE: String               \n                                                     SOURCE: User-Defined       \n                                                     ACCESS: Full               \n                                                     DESIGNATED: NO             \n                                                     DESCRIPTION:               \n\nCUSTOMER                        SAMPLE COMPANY       TYPE: String               \n                                                     SOURCE: User-Defined       \n                                                     ACCESS: Full               \n                                                     DESIGNATED: NO             \n                                                     DESCRIPTION:               \n\nOVERBURN                        5.500000e-03         TYPE: Real Number          \n                                                     SOURCE: User-Defined       \n                                                     ACCESS: Full               \n                                                     DESIGNATED: NO             \n                                                     DESCRIPTION: \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to find the string with JOB_NUMBER in it and grab the number \"XXXX-XX\" same with \"CUSTOMER\" but that will be a string not an integer.</p>\n\n<p>This cannot be done by line number because it will be different every time.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be very helpful </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","string","c#-4.0"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13275069,"title":"'u0022' to introduce quotation marks to string C#","body":"<p>I have a string property that returns a directory, it has \"program file//\" in it, so to use it in a command prompt, I have to use quotation mark around the string.

I did a search through SO archive but I couldn't find any question completely related to mine. Okay, long story short, here's the problem: <br><br>\nI'm working on inverted index. I found a couple of tutorials and tips on the net to follow and I did the following: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>class Document for stemming the words and returning them with their start and end position thanks to finditer function. </p></li>\n<li><p>class Inverted_Index that takes a collection of a documents (list in a list), tokenize them and puts them in inverted index in a form of </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>\n    {'word':{document_id:(start_pos, end_pos)}}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>like\n<code>{'cloud': {0: [(5, 10)]}, 'document': {1: [(11, 19)], 2: [(22, 30)]} ...}</code>.\n(I did document_id with a help of SO topic, iterating through enumerated collection of a documents. And about nested dictionaries, I made them amateurishly, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if nested_dict not in existing_dict:\n    existing_dict[nested_dict] = {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While I was reading stack owerflow I noticed that \"defaultdict\" datatype is pretty much superior way for doing that, but I haven't yet figured out \"collections\" module.). <br></p>\n\n<p>Back on track: inside of Inverted_Index I did a Query method (just a version of OR operator) that takes string as a query, and if that string matches a key/term in my inverted index, returns back document_id with start and ending point of a term, like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>[(1, [(0, 4), (11, 19)]), ...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And after that I was... stuck. I want to make a query output that prints out found word in a document along with it's environment, but I don't know how to connect result from a query method (document_id with start and end position) and inverted index, and I don't have a clue how to highlight that matched query inside her environment. Because of that I made starting and end point, but I have no idea how to accentuate it in python? Bold it?</p>\n\n<p>I thought of result something like: <br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>###################<br>\n      Your query:'chocolate pudding'<br>\n      Results:<br>\n      ########<br>\n      In a document with id: 1<br>\n      yaddi yaddi yadda chocolate bla bla bla pudding<br>\n      hocolate bla bla bla pudding yaddi yaddi yadda bla<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, I was reading <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.center\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.center</a> and thinking that aligning found words/queries in same column would do to trick. But I don't know how to get there, so any kind of hint would be great, because I'm not stuck in my program as I'm stuck in understanding the logic behind python, and in that case tutorials don't do justice. (Yes, I got some python books, but they have extended approach to this kind of matter, possibly considering it is not for beginners, but I don't know where to begin with, what programs to make that I can make use of. The thing is, we learn linguistic theory and IR theory in college, but we do a few things in practice.).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>And sorry about this story-of-my-life end :D</p>\n\n<p><br>\nI forgot, a code for not making this topic vague:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class inverted_index(dict):\n\n    def __init__(self,collection_of_docs):\n        for doc_id,document in enumerate(collection_of_docs):\n            for word,start,end in document.tokenize(): #form: [('sky', 0, 4)]\n                if word not in self:\n                    self[word]={}\n                if doc_id not in self[word]:\n                    self[word][doc_id]=[]\n                self[word][doc_id].append((start,end))\n\n\n    def query(self,query_string):\n        result={}\n        for query_term in re.findall(r'\\w+',query_string.lower(),re.UNICODE):\n            for doc_id in self.get(query_term,{}):\n                if doc_id not in result:\n                    result[doc_id]=self[query_term][doc_id]\n                else:\n                    result[doc_id]=result[doc_id]+self[query_term][doc_id]\n        return sorted(result.items(),key=lambda e:-len(e[1]))\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["string","powershell","path","relative-path","absolute-path"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13239620,"title":"Getting relative path from absolute path in Powershell","body":"<p><sub>Note: this \"question\" should share <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\">my knowledge, Q&amp;A style</a>.</sub></p>\n\n<h1>The problem</h1>\n\n<p>You have an absolute path but you want it to be relative to another path.<br />\nExample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P:/SO/data/database.txt\n\n--&gt; Now we want the filename to be relative to: P:/SO/team/lists/\n../../data/database.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have already found this question:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12396025/how-to-convert-absolute-path-to-relative-path-in-powershell\">How to convert absolute path to relative path in powershell?</a></p>\n\n<p>One answer links to an <a href=\"http://poshcode.org/1751\" rel=\"nofollow\">already developed Cmdlet</a> but this one didn't work for me.

I could not create such example, but I created something stranger:</p>\n\n<pre><code>program Project2;\n{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\nuses\n   SysUtils;\n\nvar s : string;\n    k : integer;\n\nfunction b : string;\nbegin\n result := 'f';\nend;\n\nprocedure c;\nvar ss : string;\nbegin\n  s := s + '{' +  b + '}';\n  ss :=  'a';\n\n  if k mod 100001 = 0 then\n  begin\n     // ss[1] := 'd';    // uncoment me\n     write(k mod 10);\n  end;\n\n  inc(k);\nend;\n\nbegin\n  while true do c;\nend.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code works fine. It just adds something to a global string with some extra operations. The thing is if  you uncomment marked string it will slow down significantly (with or without optimization). Considering that this assign value once in 100,001 iterations, it must not slow down.</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>How do default strings in Delphi work?</p></li>\n<li><p>How to avoid slow down?</p></li>\n<li><p>How to avoid out of memory?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>P.S. If I include FastMM into the main project the error disappears \np.p.s The example with the string uncommented sends my Windows 7 to BSOD in 3 minutes (from user mode).</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","c","string","winapi"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":77,"score":-1,"question_id":13157276,"title":"using wsprintf with malloc","body":"<p>Is there any mistake to write a code such:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char* sp=(char*)malloc(128);\nint x=22;\n\nwsprintf(sp,\"%d\",x);\ncout&lt;&lt;sp;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am asking specially about security mistakes?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","string","split","onkeypress"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13147575,"title":"Can I return a string into an input type: text field onkeypress?","body":"<p>I have a sentence defined as a list(a string? an array?- I'm not sure the correct term) that I want returned sequentially as any key is pressed.

I found several straight forward way of doing this on the web. The simplest is to replace the characters in question with escaped version and then insert CRLF at every 75th character. Something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// too simple, could break at an escape sequence boundary or multi-byte character may overflow 75 octets\ntxt = txt.Replace(@\"\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\").Replace(\";\", \"\\\\;\").Replace(\",\", \"\\\\,\").Replace(\"\\r\\n\", \"\\\\n\");\nvar regex = new System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex( \".{75}\");\nvar escape_and_folded = regex.Replace( txt, \"$0\\r\\n \");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I see two issues. It’s possible that the CRLF is inserted into an escaped sequence. For example, if insertion occurs such that an escaped new line sequence “\\n” becomes “\\CRLF” (then the “n” will be on the next line). The second issue is when there are multi-byte characters. Since calculation is per characters it’s possible that the line may become longer than 75 octets.</p>\n\n<p>A simple solution is to walk the string character by character and escape and fold but this seems rather brute force. Does anybody have a more elegant solution?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","string","date"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":651,"score":2,"question_id":7606329,"title":"Converting date string to date","body":"<p>I'm trying to use <code>strtotime</code> to convert date strings in the format <code>Jan 14th 2011</code> to the format <code>2011-01-14</code> but it's not working. </p>\n\n<p>Is this format not suitable for <code>strtotime</code> and if so, how can I convert it.

UTF8 doesn't work correctly either. Moreover, I want the output to be written to the file as a sequence of single-byte characters, so converting everything to a multibyte encoding would eventually require coming back to a single-byte representation.

Basically I needed you help to find out how to split an expression like 3/4-6,etc. I also need help with the line \"<code>ssplit= hit.partition(\"/\")</code>\" so that it will look at the entered expression and work with +,-, and * as well. Any and all help is appreciated. Also if my code above looks nasty and inefficient please give me criticism. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Note I can't, and wouldn't want to use eval.\nOrder of operations is required.\nI cant use complicated commands.
