Readers should note that when targeting C++11, the standard now requires that <code>basic_string</code> be contiguous, so the above question is a non issue when targeting that standard.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","string","codeigniter"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13294292,"title":"CodeIgniter: Is there a string contains function?","body":"<p>Form on Page:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;?php echo form_open('add/player');\n    echo form_label('First Name','playerFirstName');\n    echo form_input('playerFirstName','test');\n    echo \"&lt;br /&gt;\";\n    echo form_label('Last Name','playerLastName');\n    echo form_input('playerLastName','test');\n    echo \"&lt;br /&gt;\";\n    echo form_submit('addPlayer','Add Player');\n    echo form_close(); ?&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Called Controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Add extends CI_Controller\n{\n    public function index()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('header');\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('add');\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('footer');\n    }\n\n    public function Player()\n    {\n        if(strtoupper($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) == 'POST')\n        {\n            if(basename($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']) == basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']))\n            {\n                $this-&gt;load-&gt;model('players');\n                $returnMessage = $this-&gt;players-&gt;add_player($this-&gt;input-&gt;post('playerFirstName'), $this-&gt;input-post('playerLastName'));\n            }\n        }\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('header');\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('addplayer');\n        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('footer');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm a very green novice when it comes to PHP, CodeIgniter and MySQL (or web coding in general), so if you see any suggestions, please don't hesitate to make them (though the credit will be given to the one who answers my question, not makes my code work the best).  However, as to my question, is there a way to see if a string is within another string?  My <code>$returnMessage</code>, if successful will have the word <code>successfully</code> in it.

In the <code>players</code> table, I save the <code>nameid</code> that is associated with that name in the <code>people_names</code> table.  In my <code>add_player</code> function, I check to see if the names are in the table, if they aren't I add them, then I add the player to the <code>players</code> table with the appropriate ids.  Because of this, I'm not sure <code>form_validation</code> would be able to be used or not.  If it were, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>So what I want to do is check the <code>$returnMessage</code> and if it doesn't contain <code>successfully</code>, then I want to add the values back to the fields.  However, I'm not finding a function where I can see if a string is inside of another string.  I see string compares and substring functions, but no string contains.  Any ideas?

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an \"I.\"  There's no \"O.\"  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>s = StringIO.new\ns &lt;&lt; 'foo'\ns &lt;&lt; 'bar'\ns.to_s\n# =&gt; should be \"foo\\nbar\"\n# =&gt; really is ''`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>\n\n<p>@Mike Stone</p>\n\n<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.

I did a search through SO archive but I couldn't find any question completely related to mine. Okay, long story short, here's the problem: <br><br>\nI'm working on inverted index. I found a couple of tutorials and tips on the net to follow and I did the following: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>class Document for stemming the words and returning them with their start and end position thanks to finditer function. </p></li>\n<li><p>class Inverted_Index that takes a collection of a documents (list in a list), tokenize them and puts them in inverted index in a form of </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>\n    {'word':{document_id:(start_pos, end_pos)}}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>like\n<code>{'cloud': {0: [(5, 10)]}, 'document': {1: [(11, 19)], 2: [(22, 30)]} ...}</code>.\n(I did document_id with a help of SO topic, iterating through enumerated collection of a documents. And about nested dictionaries, I made them amateurishly, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if nested_dict not in existing_dict:\n    existing_dict[nested_dict] = {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While I was reading stack owerflow I noticed that \"defaultdict\" datatype is pretty much superior way for doing that, but I haven't yet figured out \"collections\" module.). <br></p>\n\n<p>Back on track: inside of Inverted_Index I did a Query method (just a version of OR operator) that takes string as a query, and if that string matches a key/term in my inverted index, returns back document_id with start and ending point of a term, like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>[(1, [(0, 4), (11, 19)]), ...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And after that I was... stuck. I want to make a query output that prints out found word in a document along with it's environment, but I don't know how to connect result from a query method (document_id with start and end position) and inverted index, and I don't have a clue how to highlight that matched query inside her environment. Because of that I made starting and end point, but I have no idea how to accentuate it in python? Bold it?</p>\n\n<p>I thought of result something like: <br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>###################<br>\n      Your query:'chocolate pudding'<br>\n      Results:<br>\n      ########<br>\n      In a document with id: 1<br>\n      yaddi yaddi yadda chocolate bla bla bla pudding<br>\n      hocolate bla bla bla pudding yaddi yaddi yadda bla<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, I was reading <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.center\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.center</a> and thinking that aligning found words/queries in same column would do to trick. But I don't know how to get there, so any kind of hint would be great, because I'm not stuck in my program as I'm stuck in understanding the logic behind python, and in that case tutorials don't do justice. (Yes, I got some python books, but they have extended approach to this kind of matter, possibly considering it is not for beginners, but I don't know where to begin with, what programs to make that I can make use of. The thing is, we learn linguistic theory and IR theory in college, but we do a few things in practice.).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>And sorry about this story-of-my-life end :D</p>\n\n<p><br>\nI forgot, a code for not making this topic vague:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class inverted_index(dict):\n\n    def __init__(self,collection_of_docs):\n        for doc_id,document in enumerate(collection_of_docs):\n            for word,start,end in document.tokenize(): #form: [('sky', 0, 4)]\n                if word not in self:\n                    self[word]={}\n                if doc_id not in self[word]:\n                    self[word][doc_id]=[]\n                self[word][doc_id].append((start,end))\n\n\n    def query(self,query_string):\n        result={}\n        for query_term in re.findall(r'\\w+',query_string.lower(),re.UNICODE):\n            for doc_id in self.get(query_term,{}):\n                if doc_id not in result:\n                    result[doc_id]=self[query_term][doc_id]\n                else:\n                    result[doc_id]=result[doc_id]+self[query_term][doc_id]\n        return sorted(result.items(),key=lambda e:-len(e[1]))\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["string","powershell","path","relative-path","absolute-path"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":13239620,"title":"Getting relative path from absolute path in Powershell","body":"<p><sub>Note: this \"question\" should share <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\">my knowledge, Q&amp;A style</a>.</sub></p>\n\n<h1>The problem</h1>\n\n<p>You have an absolute path but you want it to be relative to another path.<br />\nExample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P:/SO/data/database.txt\n\n--&gt; Now we want the filename to be relative to: P:/SO/team/lists/\n../../data/database.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have already found this question:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12396025/how-to-convert-absolute-path-to-relative-path-in-powershell\">How to convert absolute path to relative path in powershell?</a></p>\n\n<p>One answer links to an <a href=\"http://poshcode.org/1751\" rel=\"nofollow\">already developed Cmdlet</a> but this one didn't work for me.

What I need\nis more like compression in the algorithmic representation from my examples\nwhich would have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>subsequent sequences (if a sequence is repeating, there would be no other\nsequence in between)</li>\n<li>no dictionary but only loops</li>\n<li>irreducable</li>\n<li>with maximum sequence sizes (which would minimize the algorithmic\nrepresentation)</li>\n<li>and let's say nested loops are allowed (contrary to what I said before in\nthe comment)</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["python","string","string-comparison","levenshtein-distance","fuzzy-comparison"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":1,"question_id":13220973,"title":"Levenshtein distance with scrambling of characters?","body":"<p>I am looking for a string comparison metric ala Levenshtein that will also work when the characters in the string have been scrambled up.

So it's not a help writing something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>String test = \"someString\";\nif(someString.length()&gt;/*someValue*/){\n    // decrement Font size\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>because an \"mmmmmmmm\" is wider than \"iiiiiiii\". </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, is there a way in Android to fit a certain <code>String</code> on a single line, so the system \"scales\" the <code>Font</code> size automatically?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>since the answer from wsanville was really nice, here's my code setting the font size dynamically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void setupButton(){\n    Button button = new Button();\n    button.setText(getButtonText()); // getButtonText() is a custom method which returns me a certain String\n    Paint paint = button.getPaint();\n    float t = 0;\n    if(paint.measureText(button.getText().toString())&gt;323.0){ //323.0 is the max width fitting in the button\n    t = getAppropriateTextSize(button);\n    button.setTextSize(t);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate float getAppropriateTextSize(Button button){\n    float textSize = 0;\n    Paint paint = button.getPaint();\n    textSize = paint.getTextSize();\n    while(paint.measureText(button.getText().toString())&gt;323.0){\n        textSize -= 0.25;\n        button.setTextSize(textSize);\n    }\n    return textSize;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","instance"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":3,"question_id":13149046,"title":"Java Class isntance(with ToString method overriding) outputs \"adt.BinaryNode@1e24e45\"","body":"<p>Hello i have overriden <code>toString()</code> method in my own class, but somehow the output is not exactly the one I wanted.

I found several straight forward way of doing this on the web. The simplest is to replace the characters in question with escaped version and then insert CRLF at every 75th character. Something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// too simple, could break at an escape sequence boundary or multi-byte character may overflow 75 octets\ntxt = txt.Replace(@\"\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\").Replace(\";\", \"\\\\;\").Replace(\",\", \"\\\\,\").Replace(\"\\r\\n\", \"\\\\n\");\nvar regex = new System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex( \".{75}\");\nvar escape_and_folded = regex.Replace( txt, \"$0\\r\\n \");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I see two issues. It’s possible that the CRLF is inserted into an escaped sequence. For example, if insertion occurs such that an escaped new line sequence “\\n” becomes “\\CRLF” (then the “n” will be on the next line). The second issue is when there are multi-byte characters. Since calculation is per characters it’s possible that the line may become longer than 75 octets.</p>\n\n<p>A simple solution is to walk the string character by character and escape and fold but this seems rather brute force. Does anybody have a more elegant solution?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","string","date"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":655,"score":2,"question_id":7606329,"title":"Converting date string to date","body":"<p>I'm trying to use <code>strtotime</code> to convert date strings in the format <code>Jan 14th 2011</code> to the format <code>2011-01-14</code> but it's not working. </p>\n\n<p>Is this format not suitable for <code>strtotime</code> and if so, how can I convert it.

Basically I needed you help to find out how to split an expression like 3/4-6,etc. I also need help with the line \"<code>ssplit= hit.partition(\"/\")</code>\" so that it will look at the entered expression and work with +,-, and * as well. Any and all help is appreciated. Also if my code above looks nasty and inefficient please give me criticism. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Note I can't, and wouldn't want to use eval.\nOrder of operations is required.\nI cant use complicated commands.

I cannot figure out how to do that in PHP.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","string"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":319,"score":3,"question_id":931476,"title":"finding a function name and counting its LOC","body":"<p>So you know off the bat, this is a project I've been assigned.

be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$newStr = '&lt;bookstore id=\"book-1\"&gt;&lt;languages default=\"en\"&gt;';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, using that <b>$newStr</b> variable, I tried to get the tag that I wanted (the second tag, which is now the first tag of my <b>$newStr</b> variable) like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$wantedTag = substr($newStr, 0, strpos($newStr, '&gt;');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the problem I'm having is that Nothing is returned (or maybe empty string is returned) when I do this. But if I replace the 0 by 1 like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$wantedTag = substr($newStr, 1, strpos($newStr, '&gt;');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get my second tag but without the initial '&lt;':</p>\n\n<pre><code>$wantedTag = 'bookstore id=\"book-1\"&gt;';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which makes total sense because the character 'b' is at position 1.

The issue is that I don't know how to go about iterating through the tags in the string so that I can manipulate it.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any way to do string manipulation the way I described it?

I basically create the GPO on the domain, and import a previous GPO that was backed up.  That part works great.  However I have an ADM template that makes a registry change.  That registry value needs to have its string (REG_SZ) data altered dependent on other variables.  What I've noticed when I backup a GPO is I get a Registry.pol file, that contains those 'enabled' ADM template policies.

(The reformatting basically just involves taking certain lines, leaving out others, and appending a bit of extra data to the end of each line). It seems to work perfectly well, but on several different data files it seems to get hung up on one line in particular and start outputting that one line indefinitely- I have to manually stop the process. I think it may have to do with the way that the 'fileSize' variable is stored, (if you look at the output, you can see that the fileSize that is repeated is not correct for that line, and that it corresponds with the line before it started repeating). Other than that I have no idea what to look for or fix, and I've been wrestling with this issue for several days. I'll include the code and the output of running it.

So I wrote a working code in Python which runs like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def inter(arr1,arr2,p1,p2,arr):\n    thisarr = copy(arr)\n    if p1 == len(arr1) and p2 == len(arr2):\n        printarr(thisarr)\n    elif p1 == len(arr1):\n        thisarr.extend(arr2[p2:])\n        printarr(thisarr)\n    elif p2 == len(arr2):\n        thisarr.extend(arr1[p1:])\n        printarr(thisarr)\n    else:\n        thisarr.append(arr1[p1])\n        inter(arr1,arr2,p1+1,p2,thisarr)\n        del thisarr[-1]\n        thisarr.append(arr2[p2])\n        inter(arr1,arr2,p1,p2+1,thisarr)\n    return\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It comes at each point in a string, then for one recursive call, it considers the current element as belonging to the first array, and in the next call, belonging to the other array. So if the input strings are <code>ab</code> and <code>cd</code>, it prints out <code>abcd</code>, <code>acbd</code>, <code>cdab</code>, <code>cabd</code>, etc. <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> are pointers to the arrays (Because Python strings are immutable, I am using arrays!). Can anybody tell me, what is this code's complexity, and if it can be improved or not?

The idea is to check for a match in each lookup URI, and then redirect to the replacement URI (with a 301 redirect, of course) - useful for those moving a static HTML site over to my bundle.</p>\n\n<p>The format of the array is:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>'redirects' =&gt; array(\n    '&lt;source&gt;' =&gt; '&lt;destination&gt;'\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Within the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>, the user can include the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Regular Expressions</li>\n<li>Laravel-style placeholders: <code>(:any)</code>, <code>(:all)</code>, <code>(:num)</code>, or <code>(:alpha)</code> - I added that last one.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For example, the user could use the following redirect (note that I have chosen to use angular parenthises for the <code>&lt;destination&gt;</code> as it a little more aesthetic - it is converted back down to its regex equivalent [see the class below]):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>'(:all).html' =&gt; '&lt;1&gt;'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would direct any page ending with <code>.html</code> to a route that does not contain it. Example: <code>http://example.com/about.html</code> would redirect to <code>http://example.com/about</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>\n\n<p>I would like to be able to 'name' each parameter for easy-reading (and pleasant coding). What I'd like to do is name each placeholder in <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> (this is optional, of course), AND define a placeholder-type. For example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>'(name:all).html' =&gt; '&lt;name&gt;'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, considering that the placeholders <em>could</em> be named, they could naturally be in any order within the <code>&lt;destination&gt;</code>, for example (note the order changes in the destination URI):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>'Products/(name:any)-(category:any)-(id:num).html' =&gt; 'products/&lt;category&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;name&gt;/overview'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the regular placeholder syntax, I <em>could</em> interpret this as:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>'Products/(:any)-(:any)-(:num).html' =&gt; 'products/&lt;2&gt;/&lt;3&gt;/&lt;1&gt;'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the fallback anyway - I'd need to find out how to replace the names with their corresponding capture groups using <code>preg_replace</code>. But it seems to not be possible using named parameters/captures:</p>\n\n<h3>NAMED PARAMETERS</h3>\n\n<p>An easy route would be by using named parameters in <code>preg_replace</code>, but (as I understand this) PHP does not support it.</p>\n\n<p>Using this method would enable me to use the same kind of replacement tools to get the task done - so not having it available is a little disappointing.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, I am happy to revert to something a little more complex (which is a good thing, anyway). Thing is, I have no idea how - and a solution is just not coming to me. I have had a look at the <a href=\"http://silex.sensiolabs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silex</a> <code>RouteCompiler</code> class, but do not understand it fully. I feel that, considering the backbone of Lavarel is built upon the Symfony component-set (much like Silex), there may be a better way to accomplish what I need.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had the same kind of requirements, and perhaps found a solution? Any help here would be simply awesome! Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<h2>CURRENT CLASS</h2>\n\n<p>Here's the source to the class that handles the redirects.
