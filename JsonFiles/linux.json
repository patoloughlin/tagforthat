I used python because I wanted to parameterize the script, and I find it easiest to do in python.  I cheated and just ran bash commands from python through os.system.  Python just handled parameterization and flow control.

This mostly only provides times down to the millisecond range and typically has a granularity of 10-20 miliseconds. However the resolution/granularity of <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/2/gettimeofday\" rel=\"nofollow\">gettimeofday()</a> is often <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/4776133/1504523\">reported </a> to be in the few microseconds range. I assume the microsecond granularity must be taken from a different source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is the microsecond resolution/granularity of gettimeofday() accomplished?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the part down to the millisecond is taken from the RTC and the mircoseconds are taken from a different hardware, a problem with phasing of the two sources arises. The two sources have to be <code>synchronized</code> somehow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is the synchronization/phasing between these two sources accomplished?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> From what I've read in links provided by amdn, particulary the following <a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/best-timing-function-for-measuring-ipp-api-timing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel</a> link, I would add a question here: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Does <code>gettimeofday()</code> provide resolution/granularity in the microsecond regime at all?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2: Summarizing the amdns <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13231654/1504523\">answer</a> with some more results of reading:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Linux only uses the realtime clock (RTC) at boot time\nto synchronize with a higher resolution counter, i.g. the Timestampcounter (TSC). After the boot <code>gettimeofday()</code> returns a time which is entirely based on the TSC value and the frequency of this counter. The initial value for the TSC <code>frequency</code> is corrected/calibrated by means of comparing the system time to an external time source. The adjustment is done/configured by the <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/2/adjtimex\" rel=\"nofollow\">adjtimex()</a> function. The kernel operates a phase locked loop to ensure that the time results are monotonic and consistent. </p>\n\n<p>This way it can be stated that <code>gettimeofday()</code> has microsecond resolution. Taking into account that more modern Timestampcounter are running in the GHz regime, the obtainable resolution could be in the nanosecond regime. Therefore this meaningfull comment </p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n407  * do_gettimeofday - Returns the time of day in a timeval\n408  * @tv:         pointer to the timeval to be set\n409  *\n410  * NOTE: Users should be converted to using getnstimeofday()\n411  */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be found in <a href=\"http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/time/timekeeping.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux/kernel/time/timekeeping.c</a>. This suggest that there will possibly\nbe an even higher resolution function available at a later point in time. Right now <code>getnstimeofday()</code> is only available in kernel space.</p>\n\n<p>However, looking through all the code involved to get this about right, shows quite a few comments about uncertainties. It may be possible to obtain microsecond resolution. The function <code>gettimeofday()</code> may even show a granularity in the microsecond regime. <strong>But:</strong> There are severe daubts about its accuracy because the <em><code>drift</code></em> of the TSC frequency cannot be accurately corrected for. Also the complexity of the code dealing with this matter inside Linux is a hint to believe that it's in fact too difficult to get it right. This is particulary but not solely caused by the huge number of hardware platforms Linux is supposed to run on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> <code>gettimeofday()</code> returns monotonic time with microsecond granularity but the time it provides is almost never is phase to <code>one microsecond</code> with any other time source. </p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","module","jboss7.x"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":2,"question_id":12896950,"title":"JBoss 7 is trying to load modules libraries from JBoss bin","body":"<p>I got a module, described like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;  \n&lt;module xmlns=\"urn:jboss:module:1.0\" name=\"com.mymodule\"&gt;  \n  &lt;resources&gt; \n    &lt;resource-root path=\"myFirstJar.jar\" /&gt;\n    &lt;resource-root path=\"mySecondJar.jar\" /&gt;\n    &lt;resource-root path=\"Lib/linux\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/resources&gt;\n&lt;/module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my jboss-deployment-structure.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;&lt;deployment&gt;\n  &lt;dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;module name=\"com.mymodule\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/deployment&gt;&lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The jar files are found, but one of them tries to access an .so library.

Would just like to make some simple non-GUI (and non-'text') games in C on Linux for fun...</p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to be with a few #includes to header files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;asm/page.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;\n#include &lt;linux/fb.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Trying the code as given in the book:  </p>\n\n<p><strong>> cc the_file.c</strong><br>\ngives<br>\n<em>fatal error: asm/page.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.</em></p>\n\n<p>And indeed it seems that these files live somewhere else (nowadays?) so I tried amending initially just the first #include to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;/usr/src/linux-headers-3.0.0-17-generic/include/asm-generic/page.h&gt;    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I chose this particular folder of headers (there are several in /usr/src/) because<br>\n<strong>> uname -r</strong><br>\n<em>3.0.0-17-generic</em></p>\n\n<p>With the amended #include, I then get the compilation error:</p>\n\n<p>In file included from the_file.c<br>\n<em>/usr/src/linux-headers-3.0.0-17-generic/include/asm-generic/page.h:96:38: fatal error: asm-</em><br>\ngeneric/memory_model.h: No such file or directory<br>\ncompilation terminated.</p>\n\n<p>And looking in that page.h, it specifies\ninclude asm-generic/memory_model.h\n(removed the hashs and 'tags' as this line won't show up here properly otherwise)\nbut this file does exist in the same folder.</p>\n\n<p>So, before I go on a wild-goose-chase (firstly removing the asm-generic/ bit of the previous include and putting it in quotes), what is the correct procedure I should be using here? Is there an obvious right way to get the book source code to compile?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. Will be most grateful for any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","linux","opencv","face-detection","cropping"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":5,"question_id":13211745,"title":"Detect face then autocrop pictures","body":"<p>I am trying to find an app that can detect faces in my pictures, make the detected face centered and crop 720 x 720 pixels of the picture.

User applications can pull in function prototypes from the standard headers and link with the C library to use your system call (or the library routine that in turn uses your syscall call). If you just wrote the system call, however, it is doubtful that glibc already supports it!</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Linux provides a set of macros for wrapping access to system calls. It sets up the register contents and issues the trap instructions. These macros are named _syscalln(), where n is between zero and six. The number corresponds to the number of parameters passed into the syscall because the macro needs to know how many parameters to expect and, consequently, push into registers. For example, consider the system call <code>open()</code>, defined as</p>\n\n<pre><code>long open(const char *filename, int flags, int mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The syscall macro to use this system call without explicit library support would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define __NR_open 5\n_syscall3(long, open, const char *, filename, int, flags, int, mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, the application can simply call <code>open()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For each macro, there are 2+2xn parameters. The first parameter corresponds to the return type of the syscall. The second is the name of the system call. Next follows the type and name for each parameter in order of the system call. The __NR_open define is in ; it is the system call number. The _syscall3 macro expands into a C function with inline assembly; the assembly performs the steps discussed in the previous section to push the system call number and parameters into the correct registers and issue the software interrupt to trap into the kernel. Placing this macro in an application is all that is required to use the open() system call.</p>\n\n<p>Let's write the macro to use our splendid new <code>foo()</code> system call and then write some test code to show off our efforts.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define __NR_foo 283\n__syscall0(long, foo)\n\nint main ()\n{\n        long stack_size;\n\n        stack_size = foo ();\n        printf (\"The kernel stack size is %ld\\n\", stack_size);\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does <strong><em>the application can simply call <code>open()</code></em></strong> mean?</p>\n\n<p>Besides, for the last piece of code, where is the declaration of <code>foo()</code>?

One of those tasks is the performance of the particle system. In mind that the performance will increase when changing from 1.0 to 2.0 we discovered the opposite. <strong>Version 1.0 seems to perform much better than Version 2.0</strong>. Now we would like to discover if this can be right or not and hopefully someone can give us a hint what we could miss (wrong settings of Cocos2d-x, wrong settings, ... ).</p>\n\n<p>To test the performance, we created a simple test scenario: Using one particle system which can be added multiple times whenever pressing the scene. This particle system uses different sized textures (4x4px and 32x32px) and a Quad Particle System.</p>\n\n<p>The base of the test is the HelloWorld example of Cocos2d-x. Additionally, we enabled the touch receiver, created the batch (if needed), converted a label to a counter and added the particle system insertion routine. The source code and resources are attached as link for a zip archive below.  </p>\n\n<p>We compared the Linux version of Cocos2d-x and the Qt (MeeGo Harmattan) version of Cocos2d-x. The test results can be found in the excel sheet <a href=\"http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Performance_Tests.ods\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Performance_Tests.ods</a>. In every test case the 1.0 version was performer than 2.0. In every test case, the batched particle system had the same performance as the unbatched particle system from Cocos2d-x 2.0. The performance was measured in FPS/Particle Systems.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Results:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>No performance difference between batched and unbatched systems can be seen because of the small texture which was used by every effect. So there aren't many OpenGL state changes. Maybe a stronger effect could be seen when using huge textures with a lot transparency or much more particles (which is not possible due to the performance drop) or when using different particles which use different textures to fore OpenGL state changes.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the performance drop in general might not be only on the graphic side, but more on the high utilization of the CPU (calculating the positions of the particles in each frame for thousands of particles i.e.: 47 particle systems with 350 particles produce a payload of 47*350 = 16450 particles, which need to be recalculated each frame). When using batched particles this is also the highest amount of particles which can be used because the GL draw function uses an unsigned short value which is reached with 16450 particles. 16450 * 4 (vertices) = 65800 (ushort = 65535). This can be seen (on the screenshots) when using batched particles vs. unbatched particles on a desktop machine. After 47 inserted particles into the batch, it will stop displaying the new effects. When more effects are added the performance still continues to decrease which illustrates that the performance-loss is mainly based on the CPU side rather than on the GPU. This can also be notices when using 4x4px textures instead of 32x32px only about 10 more effects can be placed (on desktop).</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Related Topics:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:2_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:2_0_0</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:1_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:1_0_0</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Performance</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The excelsheet, screenshots and source code can be found in the archive - <a href=\"http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.zip</a>\nhttp://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.ods</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","windows","windows-7","dns"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13211400,"title":"Enforcing DNS server for a suffix","body":"<p>I work with many VirtualHosts on a linux server run from a VMWare.

I captured the packet in the PRE_ROUTING hook.\nThen I created a new skb, populated it from the old received skb, and then altered the \nsource address (saddr), destination address (daddr), source port (source), and destination\nport (dest), so that the packet can be forwarded from the PRE_ROUTING hook. As routing \ndecisions are made after the packet passes from the hook, I look for the packet to be forwarded to its originating source. But for some reason it is not doing like that. The packet is received, and everything is altered, but the packet does not seem to move backwards. I do not understand what is missing, and also what is needed to make it work. More specifically, what is needed to send a packet to the network from a PRE_ROUTING hook?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","linux","ssl","https","httpclient"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":867,"score":0,"question_id":10063882,"title":" Failure initializing default SSL context","body":"<p>my httpclient project has encountered a strange problem .it run successful in other two Centos systems with java1.6. but it failed in another machine(centos and java1.6). the problem is:</p>\n\n<pre>\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failure initializing default SSL context\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createDefaultSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:211)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.(SSLSocketFactory.java:333)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory.java:165)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.conn.SchemeRegistryFactory.createDefault(SchemeRegistryFactory.java:45)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.createClientConnectionManager(AbstractHttpClient.java:294)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.getConnectionManager(AbstractHttpClient.java:445)\n     [java]    at simulativeLogin.WebClientDevWrapper.wrapClient(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at simulativeLogin.GetAccessToken.getToken(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at crawler.FriendshipCrawler.main(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecuteJava.run(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecuteJava.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.run(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.executeJava(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.executeJava(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.UnknownElement.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.dispatch.DispatchUtils.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Task.perform(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Target.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Target.performTasks(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeSortedTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTarget(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.helper.DefaultExecutor.executeTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.runBuild(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.startAnt(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.run(ant-launcher-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.main(ant-launcher-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java] Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException\n     [java]    at gnu.javax.net.ssl.provider.X509KeyManagerFactory.engineGetKeyManagers(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:187)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createDefaultSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:209)\n</pre>\n"},{"tags":["linux","real-time","communication"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"question_id":13203831,"title":"Can embedded Linux meet a 200ms timing requirement?","body":"<p>I'm working on an embedded Linux project where we need to ACK a message from the serial port within 200ms.

I'm writing a server (so I have to first respond to the incoming SYN packet), and for whatever reason I can't seem to get it right.  Yes, I realize that a SOCK_STREAM will handle this for me, but for reasons I don't want to go into that isn't an option.</p>\n\n<p>The tutorials I've found online on using raw sockets all describe how to build a SYN flooder, but this is somewhat easier than actually establishing a TCP connection, since you don't have to construct a response based on the original packet.  I've gotten the SYN flooder examples working, and I can read the incoming SYN packet just fine from the raw socket, but I'm still having trouble creating a valid SYN/ACK response to an incoming SYN from the client.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone know a good tutorial on using raw sockets that goes beyond creating a SYN flooder, or does anyone have some code that could do this (using SOCK_RAW, and not SOCK_STREAM)?  I would be very grateful.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>MarkR is absolutely right -- the problem is that the kernel is sending reset packets in response to the initial packet because it thinks the port is closed.  The kernel is beating me to the response and the connection dies.  I was using tcpdump to monitor the connection already -- I should have been more observant and noticed that there were TWO replies one of which was a reset that was screwing things up, as well as the response my program created. D'OH!</p>\n\n<p>The solution that seems to work best is to use an iptables rule, as suggested by MarkR, to block the outbound packets.  However, there's an easier way to do it than using the mark option, as suggested.  I just match whether the reset TCP flag is set.  During the course of a normal connection this is unlikely to be needed, and it doesn't really matter to my application if I block all outbound reset packets from the port being used.  This effectively blocks the kernel's unwanted response, but not my own packets.  If the port my program is listening on is 9999 then the iptables rule looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 9999 --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["linux","bash","grep"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13198662,"title":"grep initial space","body":"<p><code>man bash | grep \"\\-d\"</code></p>\n\n<p>lots of results</p>\n\n<p><code>man bash | grep \" \\-d\"</code></p>\n\n<p>no results</p>\n\n<p>What's going on here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","permissions","acl"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":0,"question_id":13198647,"title":"linux/setfacl - Set all current/future files/directories in parent directory to 775 with specified owner/group","body":"<p>I have a directory called \"members\" and under it there are folders/files.

Binary hex diffs show large chunks of differences in the .so files. The .a files seem to follow a pattern of the same value being consistently different (and this could very well be <strong>TIME</strong> and <strong>DATE</strong> macro values) but the .so files are not even in the same ballpark.

For historical reasons our product uses the evil linker flag -Bsymbolic.  Among the side effects of this is that when a symbol is undefined but called, the GLIBC runtime linker will bomb in exactly this way, and you see it in the debugger as a process exited with 0177.  When the runtime linker aborts this way, I'd guess it makes the syscall to _exit directly (rather than using the C runtime library exit() or _exit()).  That would be consistent with the fact that I was unable to catch this with an the exit breakpoints in the debugger.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","linux","static","destructor","gcc4.7"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":3,"question_id":13168840,"title":"Static Instance of A Class Does Not Handle Resource Deletion Properly At Program Exit","body":"<p>I discovered this accidentally today when I was working on my project.\nBasically, in my project, I have something similar to below for resource handling.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Resource {\npublic:\n    static Resource instance_;\n    ~Resource () {\n        std::for_each(res_.begin(), res_.end(), [&amp;] (Stuff *stuff) {\n            delete stuff;\n        });\n    }\nprivate:\n    std::set&lt;Stuff*&gt; res_;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running this again valgrind, upon program exit, I'm seeing some really cryptic errors.\nSomething like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>by 0x40DD42: std::_Rb_tree&lt;unsigned int, std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt;, \nstd::_Select1st&lt;std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt; &gt;, std::less&lt;unsigned int&gt;, \nstd::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;::equal_range(unsigned int const&amp;)\n\\\\ a lot, lot more to come...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reading through all this, it seems to indicate that the destructor of <code>Resource</code> is freeing already freed memory region.</p>\n\n<p>But my destructor is definitely handling things correctly.

I am running a Web service using <code>Yaws Web Server</code>. On the same node, i have Mnesia running with about 3 <code>ram_copies</code> tables. Its a notification system, as part of a larger Web application running on an intranet. Users access this very system via JSONP from the main application running off a different web server and a different hardware as well. Each user connection queries mnesia directly for any data it needs. However, as users increase i always get the <code>crash dump</code>. I have tweaked the application itself as much as possible, clean up the code to standard, used more binaries than strings e.t.c. avoided single points like gen_servers between yaws processes and mnesia, so that each connection, just hits mnesia directly.

The most interesting thing (which crashes my program), is that this memory won't deallocate after <code>MPI_Send</code> and still take huge space.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<pre><code> System memory usage before MPI_Send, rank: 0\nName:   test_send_size                                                                                \nState:  R (running)                                                                                  \nPid:    7825                                                                                           \nGroups: 2840                                                                                        \nVmPeak:   251400 kB                                                                                 \nVmSize:   186628 kB                                                                                 \nVmLck:        72 kB                                                                                  \nVmHWM:      4068 kB                                                                                  \nVmRSS:      4068 kB                                                                                  \nVmData:    71076 kB                                                                                 \nVmStk:        92 kB                                                                                  \nVmExe:       604 kB                                                                                  \nVmLib:      6588 kB                                                                                  \nVmPTE:       148 kB                                                                                  \nVmSwap:        0 kB                                                                                 \nThreads:    3                                                                                          \n\n System memory usage after MPI_Send, rank 0\nName:   test_send_size                                                                                \nState:  R (running)                                                                                  \nPid:    7825                                                                                           \nGroups: 2840                                                                                        \nVmPeak:   456880 kB                                                                                 \nVmSize:   456872 kB                                                                                 \nVmLck:    257884 kB                                                                                  \nVmHWM:    274612 kB                                                                                  \nVmRSS:    274612 kB                                                                                  \nVmData:   341320 kB                                                                                 \nVmStk:        92 kB                                                                                  \nVmExe:       604 kB                                                                                  \nVmLib:      6588 kB                                                                                  \nVmPTE:       676 kB                                                                                  \nVmSwap:        0 kB                                                                                 \nThreads:    3        \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c","linux","pipeline"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":67,"score":-4,"question_id":13111073,"title":"I try to learn pipe in c language on linux","body":"<p>I try to learn pipeline in c language on linux . \nI write follow program. \nAre there any error in this program?</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n\n\nint main (void)\n{\n    int fd[2], nbytes;\n    pid_t childpid;\n    char string[]= \"Hello, World!\\n\";\n    char readbuffer[80];\n\n\n    pipe(fd);\n\n    if((childpid = fork()) == -1)\n    {\n        perror(\"fork\");\n        exit(0);

What's missing now is some scripts to let the admins control these daemons like they control other daemons on the server (e.g. start at boot).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately my *nix skills, especially when it comes to scripting, are not top level. I have a basic understanding of the BSD-style init procedure (rc.d), but looking at sample scripts like <a href=\"http://www.source-code.biz/snippets/java/javaDaemonTest.sh.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a> I feel a little lost.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, <strong>isn't there a simpler way to do this</strong> in my case? I mean, my daemons already understand the commands and should themselves be responsible for any actions (except in the case where a daemon doesn't respond to stop - it should then be killed after some timeout).</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","select","multiprocessing","fifo","epoll"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":2,"question_id":13089632,"title":"Fail to wake up from epoll_wait when other process closes fifo","body":"<p>I'm seeing different <code>epoll</code> and <code>select</code> behavior in two different binaries and was hoping for some debugging help. In the following, <code>epoll_wait</code> and <code>select</code> will be used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>I have two processes, one writer and one reader, that communicate over a fifo. The reader performs an <code>epoll_wait</code> to be notified of writes. I would also like to know when the writer closes the fifo, and it appears that <code>epoll_wait</code> should notify me of this as well. The following toy program, which behaves as expected, illustrates what I'm trying to accomplish:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint\nmain(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n  const char* filename = \"tempfile\";\n  char buf[1024];\n  memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));\n\n  struct stat statbuf;\n  if (!stat(filename, &amp;statbuf))\n    unlink(filename);\n\n  mkfifo(filename, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);\n\n  pid_t pid = fork();\n  if (!pid) {\n    int fd = open(filename, O_WRONLY);\n    printf(\"Opened %d for writing\\n\", fd);\n    sleep(3);\n    close(fd);\n  } else {\n    int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);\n    printf(\"Opened %d for reading\\n\", fd);\n\n    static const int MAX_LENGTH = 1;\n    struct epoll_event init;\n    struct epoll_event evs[MAX_LENGTH];\n    int efd = epoll_create(MAX_LENGTH);\n\n    int i;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; MAX_LENGTH; ++i) {\n        init.data.u64 = 0;\n        init.data.fd = fd;\n        init.events |= EPOLLIN | EPOLLPRI | EPOLLHUP;\n        epoll_ctl(efd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &amp;init);\n    }\n\n    while (1) {\n      int nfds = epoll_wait(efd, evs, MAX_LENGTH, -1);\n      printf(\"%d fds ready\\n\", nfds);\n      int nread = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));\n      if (nread &lt; 0) {\n        perror(\"read\");\n        exit(1);\n      } else if (!nread) {\n        printf(\"Child %d closed the pipe\\n\", pid);\n        break;\n      }\n      printf(\"Reading: %s\\n\", buf);\n    }\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I do this with another reader (whose code I'm not privileged to post, but which makes the exact same calls--the toy program is modeled on it), the process does not wake when the writer closes the fifo.

The real reader configured to use <code>select</code> also fails.</p>\n\n<p>What might account for the different behavior of the two? For any provided hypotheses, how can I verify them?

I am not having problems compiling or linking, it's the problem that the exact same code is running in two completely different ways for apparently no reason. </p>\n\n<p>First off, a visual example of the differences:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's not supposed to look this way, first off the purple revtanglers in the lower left are supposed to be text, and if you look REALLLY closely you can see some points being rendered, I'm using geometry, vertex, and pixel shaders:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It should look a lot more like this, as it does in linux. Those points I was talking about are the grass in these:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hzmuy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hzmuy.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYCMh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYCMh.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's also running at 600+ FPS in linux, shaders work fine, everything works flawlessly. I added some code to check the FPS in windows(sending current fps to log file when a button is pressed) and it was running at 20-30 FPS with shaders disabled.</p>\n\n<p>I'm VERY confused by this because none of the code I'm using is actually DIFFERENT, the only differences are in how I use openGL: in windows I use GLEW to handle my extensions while in linux I use #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES.\nI've looked around and it would seem as though the code I'm using SHOULD work on both linux and windows, although I'm having these very strange effects whenever I run my program in windows.</p>\n\n<p>The problems would be: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>View seems to be stuck in an orthographic projection(when it's set up to be perspective)</li>\n<li>Shaders, Blending, Framebuffers/VBO's, Textures, are not working.</li>\n<li>Extreme delay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only places I think I could be doing something wrong would be in Initializing SDL/OpenGL/GLEW .</p>\n\n<p>I'm directly using GLEW, as the libraries I was originally linking to were giving me problems.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//SAE_GL.h\n/**Header Guard**/\n#ifndef __SAE_OPENGL__\n#define __SAE_OPENGL__\n\n/**Include**/\n///gl extensions\n#ifdef __WIN32\n    #define GLEW_STATIC\n    #include \"GL/glew.h\"\n#else\n    #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES\n#endif\n\n///opengl\n#include \"GL/gl.h\"\n#include \"GL/glu.h\"\n\n///SAE Dependencies\n#include \"SAE_Core.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window manager(WM.h simply has declarations and includes SAE_GL.h, SAE_SDL.h, and SAE_Core.h)</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"SAE_WM.h\"\n\nnamespace SAE{\n\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_QUIT_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_MENU_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_VERBOSE_FLAG = false;\n\n///Constructor\nSDL_Application::SDL_Application(){\n\n    ///Video Info\n    screen      = (SDL_Surface*)NULL;\n    videoInfo   = (SDL_VideoInfo*)NULL;\n\n    VIEW_MODE               = SAE_PERSPECTIVE;\n    VIEW_DIM                = SAE_3D;\n\n    defaultScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n    currentScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n\n    numResolutions = 0;\n\n    ///Set up our video flags\n    videoFlags  = SDL_OPENGL;
