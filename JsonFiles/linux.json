I used python because I wanted to parameterize the script, and I find it easiest to do in python.  I cheated and just ran bash commands from python through os.system.  Python just handled parameterization and flow control.  The logic was as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if socket does not exist:\n    run bash command to create socket with timeout\ncopy file using the created socket\nssh command to print using socket\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In addition to using a timeout, I also put have an option in my python script to manually close the socket should I wish to do so.  </p>\n\n<p>If anyone wants the code, just let me know and I'll either paste-bin it or put it on my git repo.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","qt","qt4","debian","qt-mobility"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13277936,"title":"How does QMediaRecorder::supportedCodec() Work?","body":"<p>I'm running Linux x86, debian-based distro.</p>\n\n<p>Qt 4.7.3 with QtMobility for Desktop</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know the architecture behind this funtion (QMediaRecorder::supportedCodec()) of QtMultimediaKit.</p>\n\n<p>Where does this funtion read the list of supportedCodec from?

This mostly only provides times down to the millisecond range and typically has a granularity of 10-20 miliseconds. However the resolution/granularity of <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/2/gettimeofday\" rel=\"nofollow\">gettimeofday()</a> is often <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/4776133/1504523\">reported </a> to be in the few microseconds range. I assume the microsecond granularity must be taken from a different source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is the microsecond resolution/granularity of gettimeofday() accomplished?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the part down to the millisecond is taken from the RTC and the mircoseconds are taken from a different hardware, a problem with phasing of the two sources arises. The two sources have to be <code>synchronized</code> somehow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is the synchronization/phasing between these two sources accomplished?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> From what I've read in links provided by amdn, particulary the following <a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/best-timing-function-for-measuring-ipp-api-timing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel</a> link, I would add a question here: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Does <code>gettimeofday()</code> provide resolution/granularity in the microsecond regime at all?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2: Summarizing the amdns <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13231654/1504523\">answer</a> with some more results of reading:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Linux only uses the realtime clock (RTC) at boot time\nto synchronize with a higher resolution counter, i.g. the Timestampcounter (TSC). After the boot <code>gettimeofday()</code> returns a time which is entirely based on the TSC value and the frequency of this counter. The initial value for the TSC <code>frequency</code> is corrected/calibrated by means of comparing the system time to an external time source. The adjustment is done/configured by the <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/2/adjtimex\" rel=\"nofollow\">adjtimex()</a> function. The kernel operates a phase locked loop to ensure that the time results are monotonic and consistent. </p>\n\n<p>This way it can be stated that <code>gettimeofday()</code> has microsecond resolution. Taking into account that more modern Timestampcounter are running in the GHz regime, the obtainable resolution could be in the nanosecond regime. Therefore this meaningfull comment </p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n407  * do_gettimeofday - Returns the time of day in a timeval\n408  * @tv:         pointer to the timeval to be set\n409  *\n410  * NOTE: Users should be converted to using getnstimeofday()\n411  */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be found in <a href=\"http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/time/timekeeping.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux/kernel/time/timekeeping.c</a>. This suggest that there will possibly\nbe an even higher resolution function available at a later point in time. Right now <code>getnstimeofday()</code> is only available in kernel space.</p>\n\n<p>However, looking through all the code involved to get this about right, shows quite a few comments about uncertainties. It may be possible to obtain microsecond resolution. The function <code>gettimeofday()</code> may even show a granularity in the microsecond regime. <strong>But:</strong> There are severe daubts about its accuracy because the <em><code>drift</code></em> of the TSC frequency cannot be accurately corrected for. Also the complexity of the code dealing with this matter inside Linux is a hint to believe that it's in fact too difficult to get it right. This is particulary but not solely caused by the huge number of hardware platforms Linux is supposed to run on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> <code>gettimeofday()</code> returns monotonic time with microsecond granularity but the time it provides is almost never is phase to <code>one microsecond</code> with any other time source. </p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","module","jboss7.x"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":2,"question_id":12896950,"title":"JBoss 7 is trying to load modules libraries from JBoss bin","body":"<p>I got a module, described like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;  \n&lt;module xmlns=\"urn:jboss:module:1.0\" name=\"com.mymodule\"&gt;  \n  &lt;resources&gt; \n    &lt;resource-root path=\"myFirstJar.jar\" /&gt;\n    &lt;resource-root path=\"mySecondJar.jar\" /&gt;\n    &lt;resource-root path=\"Lib/linux\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/resources&gt;\n&lt;/module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my jboss-deployment-structure.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;&lt;deployment&gt;\n  &lt;dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;module name=\"com.mymodule\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/deployment&gt;&lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The jar files are found, but one of them tries to access an .so library.

User applications can pull in function prototypes from the standard headers and link with the C library to use your system call (or the library routine that in turn uses your syscall call). If you just wrote the system call, however, it is doubtful that glibc already supports it!</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Linux provides a set of macros for wrapping access to system calls. It sets up the register contents and issues the trap instructions. These macros are named _syscalln(), where n is between zero and six. The number corresponds to the number of parameters passed into the syscall because the macro needs to know how many parameters to expect and, consequently, push into registers. For example, consider the system call <code>open()</code>, defined as</p>\n\n<pre><code>long open(const char *filename, int flags, int mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The syscall macro to use this system call without explicit library support would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define __NR_open 5\n_syscall3(long, open, const char *, filename, int, flags, int, mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, the application can simply call <code>open()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For each macro, there are 2+2xn parameters. The first parameter corresponds to the return type of the syscall. The second is the name of the system call. Next follows the type and name for each parameter in order of the system call. The __NR_open define is in ; it is the system call number. The _syscall3 macro expands into a C function with inline assembly; the assembly performs the steps discussed in the previous section to push the system call number and parameters into the correct registers and issue the software interrupt to trap into the kernel. Placing this macro in an application is all that is required to use the open() system call.</p>\n\n<p>Let's write the macro to use our splendid new <code>foo()</code> system call and then write some test code to show off our efforts.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define __NR_foo 283\n__syscall0(long, foo)\n\nint main ()\n{\n        long stack_size;\n\n        stack_size = foo ();\n        printf (\"The kernel stack size is %ld\\n\", stack_size);\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does <strong><em>the application can simply call <code>open()</code></em></strong> mean?</p>\n\n<p>Besides, for the last piece of code, where is the declaration of <code>foo()</code>?

One of those tasks is the performance of the particle system. In mind that the performance will increase when changing from 1.0 to 2.0 we discovered the opposite. <strong>Version 1.0 seems to perform much better than Version 2.0</strong>. Now we would like to discover if this can be right or not and hopefully someone can give us a hint what we could miss (wrong settings of Cocos2d-x, wrong settings, ... ).</p>\n\n<p>To test the performance, we created a simple test scenario: Using one particle system which can be added multiple times whenever pressing the scene. This particle system uses different sized textures (4x4px and 32x32px) and a Quad Particle System.</p>\n\n<p>The base of the test is the HelloWorld example of Cocos2d-x. Additionally, we enabled the touch receiver, created the batch (if needed), converted a label to a counter and added the particle system insertion routine. The source code and resources are attached as link for a zip archive below.  </p>\n\n<p>We compared the Linux version of Cocos2d-x and the Qt (MeeGo Harmattan) version of Cocos2d-x. The test results can be found in the excel sheet <a href=\"http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Performance_Tests.ods\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Performance_Tests.ods</a>. In every test case the 1.0 version was performer than 2.0. In every test case, the batched particle system had the same performance as the unbatched particle system from Cocos2d-x 2.0. The performance was measured in FPS/Particle Systems.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Results:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>No performance difference between batched and unbatched systems can be seen because of the small texture which was used by every effect. So there aren't many OpenGL state changes. Maybe a stronger effect could be seen when using huge textures with a lot transparency or much more particles (which is not possible due to the performance drop) or when using different particles which use different textures to fore OpenGL state changes.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the performance drop in general might not be only on the graphic side, but more on the high utilization of the CPU (calculating the positions of the particles in each frame for thousands of particles i.e.: 47 particle systems with 350 particles produce a payload of 47*350 = 16450 particles, which need to be recalculated each frame). When using batched particles this is also the highest amount of particles which can be used because the GL draw function uses an unsigned short value which is reached with 16450 particles. 16450 * 4 (vertices) = 65800 (ushort = 65535). This can be seen (on the screenshots) when using batched particles vs. unbatched particles on a desktop machine. After 47 inserted particles into the batch, it will stop displaying the new effects. When more effects are added the performance still continues to decrease which illustrates that the performance-loss is mainly based on the CPU side rather than on the GPU. This can also be notices when using 4x4px textures instead of 32x32px only about 10 more effects can be placed (on desktop).</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Related Topics:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:2_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:2_0_0</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:1_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/perf_test:1_0_0</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Performance</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The excelsheet, screenshots and source code can be found in the archive - <a href=\"http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.zip</a>\nhttp://www.fantasyhaze.com/sof/Particle_Perfromance_Tests.ods</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","windows","windows-7","dns"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13211400,"title":"Enforcing DNS server for a suffix","body":"<p>I work with many VirtualHosts on a linux server run from a VMWare.

I captured the packet in the PRE_ROUTING hook.\nThen I created a new skb, populated it from the old received skb, and then altered the \nsource address (saddr), destination address (daddr), source port (source), and destination\nport (dest), so that the packet can be forwarded from the PRE_ROUTING hook. As routing \ndecisions are made after the packet passes from the hook, I look for the packet to be forwarded to its originating source. But for some reason it is not doing like that. The packet is received, and everything is altered, but the packet does not seem to move backwards. I do not understand what is missing, and also what is needed to make it work. More specifically, what is needed to send a packet to the network from a PRE_ROUTING hook?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","linux","ssl","https","httpclient"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":876,"score":0,"question_id":10063882,"title":" Failure initializing default SSL context","body":"<p>my httpclient project has encountered a strange problem .it run successful in other two Centos systems with java1.6. but it failed in another machine(centos and java1.6). the problem is:</p>\n\n<pre>\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failure initializing default SSL context\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createDefaultSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:211)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.(SSLSocketFactory.java:333)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory.java:165)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.conn.SchemeRegistryFactory.createDefault(SchemeRegistryFactory.java:45)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.createClientConnectionManager(AbstractHttpClient.java:294)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.getConnectionManager(AbstractHttpClient.java:445)\n     [java]    at simulativeLogin.WebClientDevWrapper.wrapClient(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at simulativeLogin.GetAccessToken.getToken(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at crawler.FriendshipCrawler.main(Unknown Source)\n     [java]    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecuteJava.run(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ExecuteJava.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.run(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.executeJava(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.executeJava(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Java.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.UnknownElement.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.dispatch.DispatchUtils.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Task.perform(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Target.execute(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Target.performTasks(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeSortedTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTarget(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.helper.DefaultExecutor.executeTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTargets(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.runBuild(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.startAnt(ant-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.run(ant-launcher-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java]    at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.main(ant-launcher-1.7.1.jar.so)\n     [java] Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException\n     [java]    at gnu.javax.net.ssl.provider.X509KeyManagerFactory.engineGetKeyManagers(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(libgcj.so.10)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:187)\n     [java]    at org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createDefaultSSLContext(SSLSocketFactory.java:209)\n</pre>\n"},{"tags":["linux","real-time","communication"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":1,"question_id":13203831,"title":"Can embedded Linux meet a 200ms timing requirement?","body":"<p>I'm working on an embedded Linux project where we need to ACK a message from the serial port within 200ms.

I'm writing a server (so I have to first respond to the incoming SYN packet), and for whatever reason I can't seem to get it right.  Yes, I realize that a SOCK_STREAM will handle this for me, but for reasons I don't want to go into that isn't an option.</p>\n\n<p>The tutorials I've found online on using raw sockets all describe how to build a SYN flooder, but this is somewhat easier than actually establishing a TCP connection, since you don't have to construct a response based on the original packet.  I've gotten the SYN flooder examples working, and I can read the incoming SYN packet just fine from the raw socket, but I'm still having trouble creating a valid SYN/ACK response to an incoming SYN from the client.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone know a good tutorial on using raw sockets that goes beyond creating a SYN flooder, or does anyone have some code that could do this (using SOCK_RAW, and not SOCK_STREAM)?  I would be very grateful.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>MarkR is absolutely right -- the problem is that the kernel is sending reset packets in response to the initial packet because it thinks the port is closed.  The kernel is beating me to the response and the connection dies.  I was using tcpdump to monitor the connection already -- I should have been more observant and noticed that there were TWO replies one of which was a reset that was screwing things up, as well as the response my program created. D'OH!</p>\n\n<p>The solution that seems to work best is to use an iptables rule, as suggested by MarkR, to block the outbound packets.  However, there's an easier way to do it than using the mark option, as suggested.  I just match whether the reset TCP flag is set.  During the course of a normal connection this is unlikely to be needed, and it doesn't really matter to my application if I block all outbound reset packets from the port being used.  This effectively blocks the kernel's unwanted response, but not my own packets.  If the port my program is listening on is 9999 then the iptables rule looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 9999 --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["linux","bash","grep"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13198662,"title":"grep initial space","body":"<p><code>man bash | grep \"\\-d\"</code></p>\n\n<p>lots of results</p>\n\n<p><code>man bash | grep \" \\-d\"</code></p>\n\n<p>no results</p>\n\n<p>What's going on here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","permissions","acl"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":0,"question_id":13198647,"title":"linux/setfacl - Set all current/future files/directories in parent directory to 775 with specified owner/group","body":"<p>I have a directory called \"members\" and under it there are folders/files.

After I applied them again in sequence, I can no longer repro the problem, even with things restored to the original state.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: I found one reason for this sort of error recently, which may have been the original source for this problem.  For historical reasons our product uses the evil linker flag -Bsymbolic.  Among the side effects of this is that when a symbol is undefined but called, the GLIBC runtime linker will bomb in exactly this way, and you see it in the debugger as a process exited with 0177.  When the runtime linker aborts this way, I'd guess it makes the syscall to _exit directly (rather than using the C runtime library exit() or _exit()).  That would be consistent with the fact that I was unable to catch this with an the exit breakpoints in the debugger.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","linux","static","destructor","gcc4.7"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":3,"question_id":13168840,"title":"Static Instance of A Class Does Not Handle Resource Deletion Properly At Program Exit","body":"<p>I discovered this accidentally today when I was working on my project.\nBasically, in my project, I have something similar to below for resource handling.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Resource {\npublic:\n    static Resource instance_;\n    ~Resource () {\n        std::for_each(res_.begin(), res_.end(), [&amp;] (Stuff *stuff) {\n            delete stuff;\n        });\n    }\nprivate:\n    std::set&lt;Stuff*&gt; res_;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running this again valgrind, upon program exit, I'm seeing some really cryptic errors.\nSomething like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>by 0x40DD42: std::_Rb_tree&lt;unsigned int, std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt;, \nstd::_Select1st&lt;std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt; &gt;, std::less&lt;unsigned int&gt;, \nstd::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;unsigned int const, std::pair&lt;Vertex*, unsigned int&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;::equal_range(unsigned int const&amp;)\n\\\\ a lot, lot more to come...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reading through all this, it seems to indicate that the destructor of <code>Resource</code> is freeing already freed memory region.</p>\n\n<p>But my destructor is definitely handling things correctly. To prove this, I moved the deletion code out of the destructor into another member function.\nSo, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Resource {\npublic:\n    static Resource instance_;\n    ~Resource () { /* does nothing */ }\n    void clear () {\n        std::for_each(res_.begin(), res_.end(), [&amp;] (Stuff *stuff) {\n            delete stuff;\n        });\n    }\n// ... more\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I simply call clear() on the static instance before the program exits.\nNow, the error no longer appears in valgrind!</p>\n\n<p>To further prove that this is only to do with when a static instance dies when the program dies, I removed the static instance.\nInstead of having a static instance_, I just allocated an instance of <code>Resource</code> on stack in <code>main()</code> when my program starts.\nAfter this change, the problem also goes away.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm wondering why this is happening?\nDoes this have anything to do with the operating system?</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that the OS probably attempts to free everything as the program dies, and my destructor just happens to kick in during the clean-up, not before.</p>\n\n<p>The OS in question here is Linux (Ubuntu 12.10).\nThe compiler is gcc 4.7.2.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["regex","linux","shell","grep"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13169194,"title":"Returns a part of a result (GREP)","body":"<p>With this command, I would like one command to get the current mac adress only, and another command to get only the permanent mac.

I am running a Web service using <code>Yaws Web Server</code>. On the same node, i have Mnesia running with about 3 <code>ram_copies</code> tables. Its a notification system, as part of a larger Web application running on an intranet. Users access this very system via JSONP from the main application running off a different web server and a different hardware as well. Each user connection queries mnesia directly for any data it needs. However, as users increase i always get the <code>crash dump</code>. I have tweaked the application itself as much as possible, clean up the code to standard, used more binaries than strings e.t.c. avoided single points like gen_servers between yaws processes and mnesia, so that each connection, just hits mnesia directly.

That's it, nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm wondering if somehow those extensions and such which we installed months ago were somehow only saved in a local memory of sorts, and a restart has wiped them? But we installed them all as root, so I don't see why it should be any different from installing anything else.</p>\n\n<p>It makes little/no sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>To expand on an example of something that's gone very wrong, the php odbc_ extension:</p>\n\n<p>It's still on the server, it doesn't return undefined function or anything. But it just cannot connect to the datasource any more. I've tested it through the command line and it's working perfectly fine with that datasource and login details, but all of a sudden having it in the php odbc_connect() function and it just can't connect. ( [S1000][unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Unable to connect to data source. )</p>\n\n<p>But unixODBC is set up fine. Like I say i've tested it all through the terminal and it can connect, and we've not changed anything, it's just now all of a sudden not working through the PHP function.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any ideas whatsoever as to what could be going on?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This is on CentOS by the way. 5.x</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","file-io","kernel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":15,"score":1,"question_id":13115819,"title":"Reasons for direct_io failure","body":"<p>I want to know under what circumstances a direct I/O transfer will fail?</p>\n\n<p>I have following three sub-queries for that.

Then, any AJAX calls to the PHP output would return values in the MySQL database rather than making a direct call to execute server code every 10 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know there are security concerns with running execs directly from PHP, and (I hope this isn't micro-optimisation) I'm worried about CPU usage on the server. The server is running a <em>sempron</em> processor. Yes, they do still exist.</p>\n\n<p>Having this only execute when the user is on the page (idea #1) means that the server isn't running code that doesn't need to be run. However, is this slow and insecure?</p>\n\n<p>Just in case the type of linux command may be of assistance in determining it's efficiency:</p>\n\n<p><code>shell_exec(\"transmission-remote $host:$port --auth $username:$password -l\");</code></p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping that there are differences in efficiency and level of security with the two methods I have outlined above, and that this <em>isn't</em> just micro-micro-optimisation.

The idea is simple. When you start your application you pass a command and a port number. If the command is a start command, a new instance of your application will be started on the specified port. Otherwise, the command will be sent to any instance that might be running on that port.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the library provides a daemonize method that starts a daemon controller thread. It uses sockets to make your application communicate with instances of itself (as you've probably already figured out).</p>\n\n<p>For clarity, here's an example of how you would use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyApp extends Daemon\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        if (daemonize(MyApp.class, args))\n        {\n            // normal main body\n            startMyServerOrWhatever();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // failed to start or send command to daemon\n            // probably wrong syntax or unknown command\n            printUsageInfoAndExit();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Command(start = true)\n    public static int start()\n    {\n        // executed on \"start\" command, e.g. java -jar MyApp.jar start 8899\n        doSomeInitializing();\n        return 0; // return 0 or void to detach from console\n    }\n\n    @Command\n    public static void mycmd()\n    {\n        // executed on \"mycmd\" command, i.e. java -jar MyApp.jar mycmd 8899\n        doSomethingCool();\n    }\n\n    @Command(stop = true)\n    public static int stop()\n    {\n        // executed on \"stop\" command, i.e. java -jar MyApp.jar stop 8899\n        doSomeCleanup();\n        return 0; // used as application exit code\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The library works really well and I've used it to create a couple of daemons that will run on a Linux server. What's missing now is some scripts to let the admins control these daemons like they control other daemons on the server (e.g. start at boot).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately my *nix skills, especially when it comes to scripting, are not top level. I have a basic understanding of the BSD-style init procedure (rc.d), but looking at sample scripts like <a href=\"http://www.source-code.biz/snippets/java/javaDaemonTest.sh.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a> I feel a little lost.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, <strong>isn't there a simpler way to do this</strong> in my case? I mean, my daemons already understand the commands and should themselves be responsible for any actions (except in the case where a daemon doesn't respond to stop - it should then be killed after some timeout).</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","select","multiprocessing","fifo","epoll"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21,"score":2,"question_id":13089632,"title":"Fail to wake up from epoll_wait when other process closes fifo","body":"<p>I'm seeing different <code>epoll</code> and <code>select</code> behavior in two different binaries and was hoping for some debugging help.

This project is a 3D-engine(using SDL and openGL for input handling, and graphics respectively). I have been working on this project in linux(Ubuntu 10.10) for the past several months and recently decided to port the code over to a Windows 7 environment. One of the main reasons I chose SDL was because it handles window creation independent of operating system, meaning it should be rather simple to port from one OS to another. I am not having problems compiling or linking, it's the problem that the exact same code is running in two completely different ways for apparently no reason. </p>\n\n<p>First off, a visual example of the differences:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/RNcCs.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's not supposed to look this way, first off the purple revtanglers in the lower left are supposed to be text, and if you look REALLLY closely you can see some points being rendered, I'm using geometry, vertex, and pixel shaders:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y9km.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It should look a lot more like this, as it does in linux. Those points I was talking about are the grass in these:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hzmuy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hzmuy.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYCMh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.stack.imgur.com/HYCMh.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It's also running at 600+ FPS in linux, shaders work fine, everything works flawlessly. I added some code to check the FPS in windows(sending current fps to log file when a button is pressed) and it was running at 20-30 FPS with shaders disabled.</p>\n\n<p>I'm VERY confused by this because none of the code I'm using is actually DIFFERENT, the only differences are in how I use openGL: in windows I use GLEW to handle my extensions while in linux I use #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES.\nI've looked around and it would seem as though the code I'm using SHOULD work on both linux and windows, although I'm having these very strange effects whenever I run my program in windows.</p>\n\n<p>The problems would be: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>View seems to be stuck in an orthographic projection(when it's set up to be perspective)</li>\n<li>Shaders, Blending, Framebuffers/VBO's, Textures, are not working.</li>\n<li>Extreme delay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only places I think I could be doing something wrong would be in Initializing SDL/OpenGL/GLEW .</p>\n\n<p>I'm directly using GLEW, as the libraries I was originally linking to were giving me problems.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//SAE_GL.h\n/**Header Guard**/\n#ifndef __SAE_OPENGL__\n#define __SAE_OPENGL__\n\n/**Include**/\n///gl extensions\n#ifdef __WIN32\n    #define GLEW_STATIC\n    #include \"GL/glew.h\"\n#else\n    #define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES\n#endif\n\n///opengl\n#include \"GL/gl.h\"\n#include \"GL/glu.h\"\n\n///SAE Dependencies\n#include \"SAE_Core.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Window manager(WM.h simply has declarations and includes SAE_GL.h, SAE_SDL.h, and SAE_Core.h)</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include \"SAE_WM.h\"\n\nnamespace SAE{\n\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_QUIT_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_MENU_BOOL_DEFAULT = false;\nbool SDL_Application::SAE_VERBOSE_FLAG = false;\n\n///Constructor\nSDL_Application::SDL_Application(){\n\n    ///Video Info\n    screen      = (SDL_Surface*)NULL;\n    videoInfo   = (SDL_VideoInfo*)NULL;\n\n    VIEW_MODE               = SAE_PERSPECTIVE;\n    VIEW_DIM                = SAE_3D;\n\n    defaultScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n    currentScreenInfo = SAE_DEFAULT_SCREENINFO_HOLDER;\n\n    numResolutions = 0;\n\n    ///Set up our video flags\n    videoFlags  = SDL_OPENGL;

I've done this pretty successfully so far by first loading the executable and then loading a small ELF shared library that calls the start address of the executable and then exits safely.</p>\n\n<p>I would really like not doing the ELF loading myself for a few reasons, though. First, the shared library I use is written in assembly (I can't use anything else because I'm not linking to <code>libc</code>, etc.), which will be very platform-specific, and I'd like to move away from that and use C so I can compile for any platform. Also, it will be easier and safer to use Linux's native ELF loader instead of my own simplified version.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if there is a way to use my binfmt handler, an installed kernel module, to load my executable and <em>then</em> ask Linux to load my shared library (and its dependencies) into the same address space without overwriting my executable code. I first thought that the <code>uselib</code> syscall might be useful, but the description on the man page is unclear about whether or not this will serve my purposes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From libc 4.4.4 on only the library \"/lib/ld.so\" is loaded, so that\n  this dynamic library can load the remaining libraries needed (again\n  using this call).

Can I use Linux's existing capabilities to load a shared library (written in C) into an address space already containing executable code, and, if so, how can I use that library without knowing where it has been loaded?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","networking","iptables","netcat"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":2,"question_id":13095909,"title":"using netcat for external loop-back test between two ports","body":"<p>I am writing a test script to exercise processor boards for a burn-in cycle during manufacturing.

We can easily make additional sockets, endpoints and protocols which meet their type requirements. And my extension uses linux packet socket with <code>AF_PACKET</code>, <code>SOCK_RAW</code> and <code>htons(ETH_P_ALL)</code> (See <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/7/packet\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>man 7 packet</code></a> for more information about packet socket).</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example for explaining how my bridge works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[PC1] &lt;----&gt; IF1[PC2]IF2 &lt;----&gt; [PC3]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Bridge connects the network interfaces(e.g. eth0) IF1 and IF2 so PC1 can communicate with PC3 via bridge running on PC2. The way to connect interfaces is sending packets received from IF1 to IF2 (and vice versa)</p>\n\n<p>My bridge works under the wired connections as expected, but it doesn't work under the wireless connections.

To send it to PC3, PC1 has to know the MAC address of router1 so PC1 sends ARP request to <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code> And my bridge running on PC2 receives it from eth0 and send it to wlan0, but router1 never sends arp reply to PC1.</p>\n\n<p>note: SOCK_RAW packets are passed to and from the device driver without any changes in the packet data.

Am kind of confused right now, If am jumping in and hoping to let's say, implement a new feature in an existing router.\nWhat do I really need to know ? what programming tutorials will best help me get a proper understanding of this programming niche(From what I've seen it's C,Linux,Erlang) the usually embedded programs. </p>\n\n<p>So can someone please help clarify how all those things are stitched together in the technical terms,programming perspective, how to approach being a programmer in this field(modifying router stuff), recommended tutorials</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, any help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>ps. am not piggybacking here, I read some things here and there but they were all not directly relevant to each other, haven't been able to find something that puts it all into practice.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","linux","numpy","scipy"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":0,"question_id":13061379,"title":"error of install numpy on linux red hat","body":"<p>I am trying to install numpy  from <a href=\"http://www.scipy.org/Download\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scipy.org/Download</a> . </p>\n\n<p>by <code>git clone git://github.com/numpy/numpy.git numpy</code></p>\n\n<p>But, when I ran <code>python setup.py install</code></p>\n\n<p>I got:</p>\n\n<p><code>SystemError: Cannot compile 'Python.h'.

I've included the library and tested if it's actually loaded through various tests, including a tiny class called installationchecker I downloaded somewhere (sorry I don't remember where). All tests pass fine, including some that I added within my code that are simply <code>if() else</code>clauses to see if the variable where I call the validators are returning true. I developed in windows 7 on wamp, but then on the remote server the code doesn't work. \nI have a Linux testing environment where I copied the backup of my whole site. In there, I had to do <code>chown</code> to the public_html folder to be able to see it in Apache. I also had to do <code>chown</code> on the images folder. I didn't make any further changes and although I noticed that once I downloaded the backup of my site from the remote server, the owner and the group of my public_html folder was 'root', and 'root', that didn't happened with the library, which appears as owned by myself. (I have the library on a separate, sister folder to the public folder). \nAnyway, I have come to the conclusion that the problem is with the code working under Linux, but I have no idea how to investigate if I have the correct permissions on the remote server, or why are the Zend Validators not working under Linux. They work fine on my Windows 7 machine. </p>\n\n<p>The tests I did to see if the Zend Validators load are like this: \nFor the Library itself, I do an include of the following code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php $libreria = '/var/home/u230474/public_classes/Zend/ZendFramework/library';\nset_include_path(get_include_path().PATH_SEPARATOR.$libreria);\nrequire_once('Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php');\n$libload = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();\nif (!$libload) echo \"No se pudo cargar la librería Zend Framework\"; else echo \"Librería cargada\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then for each validator I do: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$validaUno = new Zend_Validate_Regex('etc, etc'); \nif (!$validaUno) echo \"No se cargó la clase de validación\"; else echo \"Clase de validación cargada\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And similary for each validator. Now, it is with the next line that there seems to be a problem, since when I do: </p>\n\n<p><code>if(!$validaUno-&gt;isValid($text))</code> etc. etc. (Here the script seems doesn't work, as none of my validations pass).

Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    void* Events[2];\n    Events[0] = CreateEvent();\n    Events[1] = CreateEvent();\n\n    pthread_start(Thread, Events[0]);\n    pthread_start(Thread, Events[1]);\n\n    WaitForMultipleObjects(2, Events, 30000) // 30 seconds timeout\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint* thread(void* Event)\n{\n    // Do something\n    SetEvent(Event);\n    // Do something\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, to implement it, i use conditional variables. But my question is - is this a right way? Or i doing something wrong? My implementation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Actually, this function return pointer to struct with mutex and cond\n// here i just simplified example\nvoid* CreateEvent(mutex, condition)\n{\n    pthread_mutex_init(mutex, NULL);\n    pthread_cond_init(condition, NULL);\n}\n\nbool SetEvent (mutex, condition)\n{\n    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);\n    pthread_cond_signal(condition);\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);\n}\n\nint WaitForSingleObject(mutex, condition, timeout)\n{\n    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);\n    pthread_cond_timedwait(condition, mutex, timeout);\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);\n}\n\n// Call WaitForSingleObject for each event. \n// Yes, i know, that its a wrong way, but it should work in my example.\nint WaitForMultipleObjects(count, mutex[], condition[], timeout);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And all seems good, but i think, that problem will appear when i call WaitFor.. function in Main thread before SetEvent in secondary thread will be called. In Windows, it worked well, but in Linux - only idea is described above.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you tell me the better way to solve it? Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPD:</strong> Timeout is very important, because one of the secondary threads may not pass SetEvent().</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","linux"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5604,"score":7,"question_id":20794,"title":"Find broken symlinks with Python","body":"<p>If I call os.stat() on a broken symlink, python throws an OSError exception.

How do I configure the Run button to push the app through the emulator?  Does it need to be started first or can it start the emulator and push the app automatically?

The set of IP addresses I am interested in is dynamically (and frequently) changing and is not known a priori. Packets that are deemed to be discarded should skip all further processing. I can grant CAP_NET_RAW capability to the process but do not want to write my own driver or modify the kernel.</p>\n\n<h2>Background information</h2>\n\n<p>A practical approach I am using for compactly representing a large set of IP addresses is a Bloom filter. This approach is already used by a dynamic packet filtering approach implemented as a device driver:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://luca.ntop.org/Blooms.pdf\">http://luca.ntop.org/Blooms.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>However, I have user-level code and have no means to tweak the kernel or write a device driver of my own.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I do already have a solution that sniffs packets based on IP addresses in an efficient manner based on a PF_PACKET socket and an RX_RING, as is done in netsniff-ng:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://netsniff-ng.org/\">http://netsniff-ng.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>My approach is the extension of the capture mechanism in netsniff (or tcpdump or Wireshark) extended with the Bloom filter principle to get more compact Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs. This works excellently but with the side effect that even if the filter discards the packet (and thus it does not appear in RX_RING), it still continues its journey in the kernel. Eventually, given there are no open sockets for much of the filtered traffic (which is mostly synthesized, as if by netsniff's trafgen) received, ICMP <code>destination-unreachable</code> messages are generated.</p>\n\n<p>The question, formulated in a different way is whether there is a C/C++ approach to selectively discard traffic based on custom code (e.g. with a Bloom filter) in an early stage of network stack processing?</p>\n\n<p>I have looked at approaches based on iptables but managing firewall rules via iptables-restore seems far too cumbersome for the scenario. Also, the addresses are not contiguous sets of IP addresses and would thus lead to a long list of separate addresses to test against.</p>\n\n<p>Efficiency is a critical aspect due to the high volume of traffic involved.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","linux","system-calls","syscall","libc"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":332,"score":1,"question_id":8457278,"title":"Is malloc/free a syscall or a library routine provided by libc?","body":"<p>If malloc/free is implemented as a library routine in libc, then is it implemented on top of the <em>sbrk</em> syscall or the <em>mmap</em> syscall, or something else?</p>\n\n<p>And to be general, does the function declared in <em>sys/syscall.h</em> contains ALL the system calls in the target machine?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","sql","sql-server","linux"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":130,"score":0,"question_id":8332420,"title":"mssql_connect stopped working mysteriously","body":"<p>I have a linux box that overnight decided to start acting up.

You can read the parts specified here from /proc/pid/mem as super-user (or a parent process like gdb does it with ptrace)\n- memory in /proc/kcore is not the same as the memory from the proces's perspective in /proc/pid/mem - so to search for the process's memory in /proc/kcore, one would have to figure out how the process's memory is mapped into kernel memory (lots of messy things and time consuming)\nSo to get the process memory, first read which regions of /proc/pid/maps it is allowed to read/write from/to and then dump-copy the regions from /proc/pid/mem.
