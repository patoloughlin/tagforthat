Could you please try the following workaround: after calling setFullScreenWindow() on a frame, call setVisible(false) followed by setVisible(true). This, in theory, should restore the correct first responder. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The snippet of code that seems to work is simply:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dev.setFullScreenWindow(f);\nf.setVisible(false);\nf.setVisible(true);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have updated the sample code with the ability to toggle this fix on and off; it is required every time a window enters fullscreen.</p>\n\n<p>In the larger context of my more complex application, I am still running into keyboard focus issues on subcomponents within the fullscreen window, where a mouse click causes my window to lose focus. (I'm guessing it's going to the undesired first responder window referenced above.)  I'll report back when I have more information about this case - I cannot reproduce it in the smaller sample yet.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 10/31:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major update to the sample code:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Includes toggle between FullScreen exclusive and Lion-style FullScreen modes</li>\n<li>Listens to the <code>KeyboardFocusManager</code> to display the hierarchy for the currently focused component</li>\n<li>Uses both input maps and <code>KeyListener</code>s to try to capture input</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also did some more digging with coworkers to try to isolate issues:</p>\n\n<p>On one front, we tried overriding some methods in RT.jar to see if there were problems with the way the screen device is being selected.  Also tried were the entry points to the Toolkit.beep() functionality to see if the alert sounds were coming from the Java side - appears not.</p>\n\n<p>On another front, it was clear that not even the native side is receiving keyboard events.  A coworker attributes this to a switch from an <code>AWTView</code> to a <code>NSWindow</code> in 7u6.</p>\n\n<p>A selection of existing Oracle bugs has been found, which you can look up <a href=\"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8000276\" rel=\"nofollow\">8000276 : [macosx] graphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(frame) crashes JVM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8000430\" rel=\"nofollow\">8000430 : [macosx] java.awt.FileDialog issues on macosx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7175707\" rel=\"nofollow\">7175707 : [macosx] PIT: 8 b43 Not running on AppKit thread issue again</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 10/26:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the comment by @maslovalex below regarding an Applet working on 7u5, I went back and painstakingly examined compatibility with the JDK versions for OSX:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>10.7.1 with 7u4: Fullscreen Works!</li>\n<li>10.7.1 with 7u5: Fullscreen Works!</li>\n<li>10.7.5 with 7u5: Fullscreen Works!</li>\n<li>10.7.5 with 7u6: Fullscreen Breaks :(</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Combined with the other tests noted elsewhere, it's clear there was an issue introduced with 7u6 that remains in 7u7 and 7u9, and it affects both Lion 10.7 and Mountain Lion 10.8.</p>\n\n<p>7u6 was a major milestone release, bringing full support of the JRE and JDK to Mac OS X and also including Java FX as part of the distribution.  Further info is available in the <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u-relnotes-515228.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Release Notes</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1854982\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roadmap</a>.  It's not tremendously surprising that such an issue could crop up as support shifts to Java FX.</p>\n\n<p>The question becomes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Will Oracle fix this in a near-term release of the JDK? (If you have links to existing bugs, please include them here.)</li>\n<li>Is a workaround possible in the interim?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other updates from today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I incorporated the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6873568/fullscreen-feature-for-java-apps-on-osx-lion\">Apple extensions approach to fullscreen mode</a> as an alternate path of exploration (updated sample code pending cleanup).  The good news: input works!  The bad news: there really don't seem to be any kiosking/isolation options.\n<BR>I tried killing the Dock - <a href=\"http://wtanaka.com/node/8008\" rel=\"nofollow\">directly</a> or with an <a href=\"http://www.mechodownload.com/forum/applications/283595-dock-killer-1-2-a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">App</a> - as I understand the Dock is responsible for Command-Tab app switching, Mission Control, and Launch Pad, only to find out that it's responsible for the handling of fullscreen apps as well!  As such, the Java calls become non-functional and never return.<BR>\nIf there's a way to <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/453241/is-it-possible-to-disable-the-command-tab-application-switcher-in-mac-os-x-lion\">disable Command-Tab</a> (and Mission Control and Launchpad and Spaces) without affecting the Dock's fullscreen handling, that would be extremely useful. Alternatively, one can try to remap certain keys such as Command, but that will affect the ability to use that modifier elsewhere in the program and the system itself (not exactly ideal, when you need to Command-C to copy some text).</p></li>\n<li><p>I've had no luck with KeyListeners (I'm not receiving any callbacks), but I have a few more options to try.</p></li>\n<li><p>Based on a coworker's suggestion, I tried <code>((sun.lwawt.macosx.LWCToolkit)Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()).isApplicationActive()</code> via reflection.  The idea was that it:<BR>\n<em>is a native method with the comment \"Returns true if the application (one of its windows) owns keyboard focus.\". Calls to this method were added in CPlatformWindow.java in the past few months related to focus logic. If it returns false in your test code, it's probably part of the problem.</em><BR>\nUnfortunately, everywhere I checked it, the method returned true.  So even according to the low level system, my windows should have keyboard focus.</p></li>\n<li><p>My previous optimism regarding the JAlbum fix has been dashed.  The developer <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/forum/thread.jspa?messageID=264497\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted a response on their forum</a> that explains how they simply removed proper fullscreen support on OS X while running Java 7.  They have a bug into Oracle (and I'm hoping to get the bug number).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 10/25:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now also tried Java 7u9 on Lion 10.7.4 and have seen the exact same issue, so it's JDK- not OS-specific.</p>\n\n<p>The core question has become whether you can embed in a fullscreen window core Swing Components that have default handling for keyboard input (<code>JTextField/JTextArea</code> or even editable combo boxes) and expect them to behave normally (without having to resort to rebuilding their basic key bindings manually).  Also in question is whether other stalwarts of windowed layouts, such as using tab for focus traversal, should work.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal goal would be to have the ability take a windowed Swing app with all of its buttons, tabs, fields, etc. and run it in fullscreen exclusive/kiosk mode with most functionality intact.  (Previously, I have seen that Dialog pop ups or ComboBox drop downs do not function in fullscreen on Java 6 on OS X, but other Components behave fine.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll be looking into the eawt FullScreen capabilities, which will be interesting if they support kiosk lock down options, such as eliminating Command-Tab application switching.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Swing app that for years has supported <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FullScreen (exclusive)</a> mode on Mac OS X up through Java 6.  I've been doing compatibility testing with the latest Mountain Lion release (10.8.2 Supplemental) and Oracle's JDK 7 and noticed a glaring issue while in that mode: mouse movement and clicks work fine, but keyboard input is not delivered to the components.  </p>\n\n<p>(I've narrowed this down in a test case below to not being able to type into a simple JTextField while in fullscreen mode.)</p>\n\n<p>One symptom is that each key press results in a system beep, as if the OS is disallowing keyboard events from being delivered to the application.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, my application has an exit hook installed, and the Command-Q combo will trigger that hook - it's clear that the OS is listening to standard key combos.</p>\n\n<p>I have tested this separately on three different Macs with various installs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Apple Java 6u35 and 6u37: both windowed and fullscreen modes receive input.</li>\n<li>On Oracle Java 7u7 and 7u9: windowed mode works as expected while fullscreen has the symptoms above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This may have been previously reported:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13015442/java-graphics-full-screen-mode-not-registering-keyboard-input\">Java Graphics Full Screen Mode not Registering Keyboard Input</a>.\nHowever, that question is not specific about the Java version or platform.</p>\n\n<p>Additional searching has turned up a separate fullscreen option introduced in Lion:\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6873568/fullscreen-feature-for-java-apps-on-osx-lion\">Fullscreen feature for Java Apps on OSX Lion</a>. \nI have yet to try using this approach, as keyboard input seems integral to the target use cases of FullScreen Exclusive mode, such as games.</p>\n\n<p>There is some mention in the JavaDoc for this mode that input methods might be disabled.  I tried to call the suggested <code>Component.enableInputMethods(false)</code>, but it seemed to <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/GraphicsDevice.html#setFullScreenWindow%28java.awt.Window%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">have no effect</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm somewhat optimistic that there's a solution to this issue based on an entry in the release notes of a Java app I came across (JAlbum). A <a href=\"http://jalbum.net/en/software/release-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated fix for 10.10.6</a>: \"Keyboard support wasn't working when running the full screen slide show on Mac and Java 7\"</p>\n\n<p>My test case is below.  It is lightly modified from the second example in this issue (which, unmodified, also exhibits my problem): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7456227/how-to-handle-events-from-keyboard-and-mouse-in-full-screen-exclusive-mode-in-ja/7457102#7457102\">How to handle events from keyboard and mouse in full screen exclusive mode in java?</a>\nIn particular, it adds a button to toggle fullscreen.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport java.beans.*;\n\n/** @see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064607/ */\npublic class FullScreenTest extends JPanel {\n    private GraphicsDevice dev = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getDefaultScreenDevice();\n    private JFrame f = new JFrame(\"FullScreenTest\");\n\n    private static final String EXIT = \"Exit\";\n    private Action exit = new AbstractAction(EXIT) {\n        @Override\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n            Object o = dev.getFullScreenWindow();\n            if(o != null) {\n                dev.setFullScreenWindow(null);\n            }\n            f.dispatchEvent(new WindowEvent(f, WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING));\n        }\n    };\n    private JButton exitBTN = new JButton(exit);\n\n    private JTextField jtf = new JTextField(\"Uneditable in FullScreen with Java7u6+ on Mac OS X 10.7.3+\");\n\n    private JLabel keystrokeLabel = new JLabel(\"(Last Modifier+Key Pressed in JTextField)\");\n\n    private JLabel jtfFocusLabel = new JLabel(\"(JTextField Focus State)\");\n\n    private JLabel focusLabel = new JLabel(\"(Focused Component Hierarchy)\");\n\n    private JCheckBox useOSXFullScreenCB = new JCheckBox(\"Use Lion-Style FullScreen Mode\");\n\n    private JCheckBox useWorkaroundCB = new JCheckBox(\"Use Visibility Workaround to Restore 1st Responder Window\");\n\n    private static final String TOGGLE = \"Toggle FullScreen (Command-T or Enter)\"; \n    private Action toggle = new AbstractAction(TOGGLE) {\n        @Override\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n            Object o = dev.getFullScreenWindow();\n            if(o == null) {\n                f.pack();\n\n                /** \n                 * !!

Initially, you will get to see a JFrame with the JMenuBar in the top. But at some point, the JDialog will pop up where a user can fill in some text fields. The problem that I'm having is that as soon as the focus goes to the JDialog, the JMenuBar disappears. What I want is that the JMenuBar stays in the top of the screen all the time, except if the whole program is NOT in focus. Here are 2 screenshots, in the first screen shot, the JFrame is selected and in the other one the JDialog is selected.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dkc57.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ShoDK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So what i actually want is instead of only seeing the JMenuBar when the focus is on the JFrame, i want to see the JMenuBar all the time.

Specifically, the example from this page:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/gui-programming.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/gui-programming.html</a>  </p>\n\n<p>The code is from the first edition of the text, so I question whether or not there's a better way in Scala 2.9, but it was clear an concise and summed up what I was misunderstanding.  </p>\n\n<p>From the example, which is a simple fahrenheit to celsius converter, I came to understand that the listener and the reactions blocks belongs after the contents block for the MainFrame.</p>\n\n<p>so I ended up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>object HumanGUI extends SimpleSwingGUIApplication {\n  def top = new MainFrame {\n    title = \"My Blackjack GUI\"\n\n    //The fields I want to work with are instantiated as object\n    object ipAddressTextField extends TextField { columns = 15 }\n    object portNumberTextField extends TextField {columns = 5 }\n\n    //other panels, objects, etc would go here\n    val OtherPanel = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Horizontal) {\n       label = \"Other Panel\"\n    }\n\n    //and here we have the contents += block for the mainframe, other panels, etc from \n    //above would be added to the main frame here\n    contents = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Vertical) {\n      contents += ipAddressTextField\n      contents += portNumberTextField\n    }\n\n    //here's the listen to, listening on the object created above, and it's enclosed in \n    //in backticks, a good explanation of that is found in the link below\n    listenTo(`ipAddressTextField`)\n    reactions += {\n      case EditDone('ipAddressTextField`) =&gt;\n        //do something!\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6576594/need-clarification-on-scala-literal-identifiers-backticks\">Need clarification on Scala literal identifiers (backticks)</a>  </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that the answer to my question is that the listenTo and reactions blocks belong in the MainFrame block, but should appear after it's contents += { //contents } block.</p>\n\n<p>Additional trial and error in eclipse shows that while this solution works for me, there is clearly much more that I don't understand.  For example, while I was unable to get listeners for KeyPress events to work if I tried to listen and react to them in within the<br>\n    val OtherPanel = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Horizontal) { }<br>\nportion of the above code, I was able to get a button registered and working like this:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>val OtherPanel = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Horizontal) {\n  val betLabel = new Label(\"Bet:\")\n  val betTextField = new TextField\n  val goButton = new Button(\"Go!\")\n\n  listenTo(goButton)\n  reactions += {\n    case ButtonClicked(b) =&gt;\n      betTextField.text = \"Go!\"\n  }\n\n  contents += betLabel\n  contents += betTextField\n  contents += goButton\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why this worked but my attempts to do something along the lines of </p>\n\n<pre><code>val OtherPanel = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Horizontal) {\n  val betLabel = new Label(\"Bet:\")\n  val betTextField = new TextField\n  val goButton = new Button(\"Go!\")\n\nlistenTo(betTextField)\nreactions += {\n  case KeyTyped(betTextField, Enter, _, _) =&gt; {\n    println(\"Caught enter\")\n  }\n\n  contents += betLabel\n  contents += betTextField\n  contents += goButton\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>didn't work is still baffling me.  I'm assuming that it should work and I'm just doing something wrong.  Perhaps that melding that approach with a case EditDone instead of a case KeyTyped(<em>,</em>,_,_) would have worked but I'm a little too burnt out right now to follow up on that.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't accepted an answer yet because I'm hoping that someone who sees this can clarify the points I still don't understand.  Should that not happen and the question remain unanswered for a few days I will likely accept @som-snytt's answer as his code was very helpful.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","image","swing","drag","jlabel"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":89,"score":0,"question_id":13130257,"title":"Drag and move a picture inside a JLabel with mouseclick","body":"<p>I have an image inside a JLabel. </p>\n\n<pre><code>JLabel label = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(\"C:\\\\image.jpg\"));\nlabel.setSize(300,300);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want the following functionality.</p>\n\n<p>-I click on a location inside the JLabel (on the image).</p>\n\n<p>-With the mousebutton pressed, I can change the location of the image within the JLabel.

First, I want to have the tooltip follow the mouse and change its text dynamically. This works somewhat by overriding getToolTipText and getToolTipLocation for the component, but the tooltip flickers as the mouse position is updated and doesn't display over the sub-components (it's a JPanel with some JTextPanes inside it).

And these crazy guys have implemented their own mouseClicked function which is about 400 lines.

After much thought, research and experimentation I've developed several design ideas but still none that seems efficient. One design has a Session god object register a listener on every UI element when created, and every object that cares about any action registers a listener on the Session object. This seems simple and robust, as all messaging goes through a central location so it's less likely that anything is lost. It's brute force though, and seems cumbersome and inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>Another design attempts to create subgroups of objects that speak to each other. This avoids the huge top-level Session and seems more efficient, but also seems error prone.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to implement a framework for reuse where I group buttons with related purposes into toolbars and have a hierarchical approach to listening for actions performed by toolbars with relevant operations to the listener. I've gotten to this so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class EditorToolBar extends JToolBar {\npublic static enum Command {\n    ZOOMIN,\n    ZOOMOUT,\n    FINER,\n    COARSER,\n    RESET\n}\n\nprivate ButtonCommandListener       listener = new ButtonCommandListener();\npublic EditorToolBar() {\n    super(\"Editor Commands\");\n    JButton button;\n    for (final Command cmd : Command.values()) {\n        button = new JButton(cmd.toString());\n        button.setEnabled(true);\n        button.setToolTipText(cmd.toString() + \" Command\");\n        button.setActionCommand(cmd.toString());\n        button.addActionListener(listener);\n        add(button);\n    }\n}\npublic void addActionListener(ActionListener pNewListener) {\n    listener.cActionNotifier.addListener(pNewListener);\n}\nprivate class ButtonCommandListener implements ActionListener {\n    private NotifierImp&lt;ActionListener&gt;         cActionNotifier = new NotifierImp&lt;ActionListener&gt;();\n    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent pEvent) {\n        for (ActionListener listener : cActionNotifier) {\n            listener.actionPerformed(pEvent);\n        }\n    }\n}\n} // class EditorTooBar\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the listeners implement something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent pEvent) {\n    switch (EditorToolBar.Command.valueOf(pEvent.getActionCommand())) {\n        case ZOOMIN:\n            // do something\n            break;\n        case ZOOMOUT:\n            // do something\n            break;\n        case FINER:\n            // do something\n            break;\n        case COARSER:\n            // do something\n            break;\n        case RESET:\n            // do something\n            break;\n        default:\n            System.out.println(\"Unknown EditorToolBar Command: \"+pEvent.getActionCommand());\n            return;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can enhance the instructor for the enum to also include tooltip text, images, etc. I'd like to reuse this design with just a different enum describing other toolbars. Listeners will distinguish different button actions using ActionEvent.getActionCommand() and use Command.toValue(String). I'd like this to extend to a hierarchy of classes that are listening: a superclass may implement a listener for one type of toolbar, and subclass add to that by listening for a different toolbar type. If the event is not from the toolbar the subclass is interested in, it can forward the event to the superclass. To make this work, I need a way to distinguish between one toolbar and another, but preferably without having to check for every button event possible from that toolbar. Ideally I'd like to have a toolbar factory, and just specifying an enum would be enough to fully describe a toolbar. Not being able to subclass an enum adds to the challenge here.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a promising design pattern to pursue? I've not seen it anywhere else yet. Is there a better way that I should be using rather than inventing something that is inferior? A link to other options would be welcome.</p>\n\n<p><b>Edit:</b> Based on the answer from yash ahuja I should clarify that when I mention hierarchy I mean similar to the way that key bindings are handled (i.e. do you have a binding? No, then does your container have a binding? ... until <i>someone</i> consumes the key event) not the actual class hierarchy.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","mvc","arraylist","jlist"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":13141732,"title":"When ArrayList is updated in Model JList should be updated in View","body":"<p>I've been playing around with this for a while now with no success.

It's hard to actually see the issue at hand when it's simply text in there.</p>\n\n<p>When you have the image displayed correctly, and you try to resize the entire GUI, you will notice that the image doesn't shrink. It keeps to its preferred size and has issues when it becomes smaller than it. In my code, it stops displaying the picture completely when it can't display at least the preferred size.

25));\nRGB.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(125, 25));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And for the listener:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent c) {\nJColorChooser RGB = (JColorChooser)c.getSource();\nColor poly = RGB.getColor();\nimagePanel.setColor(poly);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in the other class, <code>imagePanel</code>, I use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void

Al.?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you\nTim</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","jframe"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":50,"score":-1,"question_id":13051484,"title":"Java, listener advice, swing comp's advice needed :(","body":"<p>my problem is, where is says \"triangle.addActionListener(new ShapeAction());\" in my code there is a error that says ShapeAction symbol is not found, what am i doing wrong here? and could someone look at my If statement, its ment to do: once a menu item is clicked it creates a instance of that shape from another class        </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyFrame extends javax.swing.JFrame {\n    public MyFrame() {\n        // Create the menu\n        JMenuBar topMenu = new JMenuBar();\n        this.setJMenuBar(topMenu);\n\n        //create the menu button \"shapes\"\n        JMenu shapes = new JMenu(\"Shapes\");\n        topMenu.add(shapes);\n        //Create the 3 shapes for the menu\n        JMenuItem square = new JMenuItem(\"Square\");\n        square.addActionListener(new ShapeAction());\n\n        JMenuItem circle = new JMenuItem(\"Circle\");      \n        circle.addActionListener(new ShapeAction());\n\n        JMenuItem triangle = new JMenuItem(\"Triangle\");\n        triangle.addActionListener(new ShapeAction());\n\n        //add shapes to menu\n        shapes.add(circle);\n        shapes.add(triangle);\n        shapes.add(square);\n\n        //add the menu\n        setJMenuBar(topMenu);\n\n\n        MyControlPanel pane = new MyControlPanel();\n        getContentPane().add(pane);\n\n        this.add(pane);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @param args the command line arguments\n     */\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        // &lt;snip&gt;\n\n        /* Create and display the form */\n        java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n                public void run() {\n                new MyFrame().setVisible(true);\n                }\n                });\n\n        class ShapeAction implements ActionListener{\n            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){\n                JMenuItem clickedMenu = (JMenuItem)e.getSource();\n\n                if (clickedMenu.getText().equals(\"Square\")){\n                    //implement abstract methods                \n                    MyShape aSquare = new ASquare();\n\n                }\n                else if (clickedMenu.getText().equals(\"Circle\")){ \n                    //implement abstract methods\n                    MyShape ACircle = new ACircle();\n\n                }\n                else if (clickedMenu.getText().equals(\"Triangle\")){ \n                    //implement abstract methods\n                    MyShape ATriangle = new ATriangle();\n\n                }\n            }          \n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>package assignment;\n\n//import java.awt.FlowLayout;\nimport java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.FlowLayout;\nimport javax.swing.GroupLayout;\nimport javax.swing.GroupLayout.Alignment;\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JSlider;\nimport javax.swing.JTextField;\nimport javax.swing.event.ChangeEvent;\nimport javax.swing.event.ChangeListener;\n\n\npublic class MyControlPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel {\n\nJSlider slider;\nJLabel sliderLabel;\nJLabel sliderdimension;\nJLabel blank;\nJLabel dl;\nJLabel area1;\n\n/**\n * Creates new form MyControlPanel\n */\npublic MyControlPanel() {\n\n\n    slider = new JSlider();\n    slider.setValue(50);\n    slider.addChangeListener(new MyChangeAction());\n    slider.setMajorTickSpacing(10);\n    slider.setPaintLabels(true);\n    slider.setPaintTicks(true);\n    slider.setBounds(300, 50, 100, 50);\n\n    sliderLabel = new JLabel(\"50\");\n    blank = new JLabel(\"     \");\n    sliderdimension = new JLabel(\"Shape Dimension:\");\n\n    JTextField boundary_length = new JTextField(\"Boundary Length\");\n    JTextField area = new JTextField(\"Area\");\n\n    dl = new JLabel(\"Boundary Length =\");\n    area1 = new JLabel(\"Area =\");\n\n    setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n\n\n    JPanel sliderPanel = new JPanel();\n    sliderPanel.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 10, 0));\n\n\n    sliderPanel.add(sliderdimension);\n    sliderPanel.add(sliderLabel);\n    sliderPanel.add(slider);\n    sliderPanel.add(dl);\n    sliderPanel.add(boundary_length);\n    sliderPanel.add(area1);\n    sliderPanel.add(area);\n    this.add(sliderPanel, BorderLayout.PAGE_END);\n\n\n\n}\n\n/**\n * This method is called from within the constructor to initialize the form.\n * WARNING: Do NOT modify this code.

This should works only on windows machine. </p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to achieve it with Swing or SWT or any other UI controls ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","layout","awt","layout-manager"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":0,"question_id":13041539,"title":"Can't get Java GUI Layout to Show Correctly","body":"<p>I'm working on this application and I just can't get the GUI to display properly.

I also tried just passing it back as an object array but same thing happens when the combobox is created.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code, what you want to look at are the following methods:</p>\n\n<p>guiCInventory in MenuOperations where the ComboBox is created\nObject[] getINames() in Operations</p>\n\n<p>You may also want to look at addSItem to see how I am creating the ArrayList of TableValues that I am pulling the information from to try and populate the ComboBox with.</p>\n\n<p>prg421_w2_IA:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import javax.swing.JFrame;\n\npublic class prg421_w2_IA\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n{\n    GUI mMenu = new GUI();\n\n    //mMenu.setBounds(100, 100, 537, 223);\n    //mMenu.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n    //mMenu.setVisible(true);\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>GUI</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel;\n\npublic class GUI extends JFrame\n{   \npublic GUI()\n{       \n    setBounds(100, 100, 537, 223);\n    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n    getContentPane().setLayout(null);\n\n    mMenu = this;       \n    setVisible(true);\n\n    lblTitle = new JLabel(\"Retail Operations Application V1.0\");\n    lblTitle.setBounds(10, 0, 169, 14);\n    add(lblTitle);\n\n    btnAIS = new JButton(\"Add Item to Store\",null);\n    btnAIS.setBounds(392, 31, 119, 23);\n    add(btnAIS);\n\n    btnAIC = new JButton(\"Add Item to Customer Cart\",null);\n    btnAIC.setBounds(348, 65, 163, 23);\n    mMenu.getContentPane().add(btnAIC);\n\n    btnSCC = new JButton(\"Show Customer Cart\",null);\n    btnSCC.setBounds(380, 99, 131, 23);\n    mMenu.getContentPane().add(btnSCC);\n\n    btnEProgram = new JButton(\"Exit Program\",null);\n    btnEProgram.setBounds(418, 133, 93, 23);\n    mMenu.getContentPane().add(btnEProgram);\n\n    sp = new JScrollPane();\n        sp.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(ScrollPaneConstants.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER);\n    sp.setBounds(21, 36, 317, 127);\n    mMenu.getContentPane().add(sp);\n\n    txtrInstructions = new JTextArea();\n    sp.setViewportView(txtrInstructions);\n    txtrInstructions.setEditable(false);\n    txtrInstructions.setText(\"Welcome to the Retail Operations Application.

Can someone look at my code and tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n\n<pre><code>  import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Container;\nimport

I am also using Substance as a Library.</p>\n\n<p>SplashScreen's constructor adds a JLabel and JProgressBar to itself, packs and sets visible.\nThe JProgressBar is <code>setIndeterminate(true)</code>;</p>\n\n<p>When I run my program, my SplashScreen is displayed but the ProgressBar is locked, it doesn't move, not until the rest of the program has started does it start moving as expected.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing here? All searching I've done doesn't seem to mention this problem and most \"custom splash screen\" implementations go about it a very similar way to myself.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","jtable","render","nimbus"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":123,"score":2,"question_id":13008241,"title":"Nimbus and alternate row colors","body":"<p>I don't understand how alternate row coloring works in Nimbus.

The funny thing is – the file reading part must be working flawlessly, as I can see the file content being written to the standard output thanks to the <code>System.out.println ()</code> call within the <code>while</code> loop.

So when the mouse is on a panel within the <code>JScrollPane</code> it seems that the event is consumed by this panel i never seen by the scroll pane.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a <em>correct</em> way to make the events caught by the children of the scroll pane visible to this scroll pane? </p>\n\n<p>SSCCE:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q0mY5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Here a simple test case trying to show when i try to do in my Swing application.</p>\n\n<p>The frame:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class NewJFrame extends javax.swing.JFrame {\n\n    public NewJFrame() {\n        initComponents();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {\n            jPanel1.add(new TestPanel());\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate void initComponents() {\n        jScrollPane1 = new javax.swing.JScrollPane();\n        jPanel1 = new javax.swing.JPanel();\n\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        jPanel1.setLayout(new javax.swing.BoxLayout(jPanel1,    javax.swing.BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS));\n        jScrollPane1.setViewportView(jPanel1);\n\n        getContentPane().add(jScrollPane1, java.awt.BorderLayout.CENTER);\n\n        pack();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n           @Override\n            public void run() {\n                new NewJFrame().setVisible(true);\n           }\n        });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the <code>TestPanel</code> definition:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class TestPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel {\n\n    public TestPanel() {\n        initComponents();\n    }\n\n    private void initComponents() {\n\n        jLabel1 = new javax.swing.JLabel();\n        jLabel2 = new javax.swing.JLabel();\n        jScrollPane1 = new javax.swing.JScrollPane();\n        jTextArea1 = new javax.swing.JTextArea();\n\n        jLabel1.setText(\"jLabel1\");\n\n        setBackground(new java.awt.Color(255, 51, 51));\n        setLayout(new java.awt.BorderLayout());\n\n        jLabel2.setText(\"TEST LABEL\");\n        jLabel2.setHorizontalTextPosition(javax.swing.SwingConstants.CENTER);\n        add(jLabel2, java.awt.BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\n\n        jTextArea1.setEditable(false);\n        jTextArea1.setColumns(20);\n        jTextArea1.setRows(5);\n        jTextArea1.setFocusable(false);\n        jScrollPane1.setViewportView(jTextArea1);\n\n        add(jScrollPane1, java.awt.BorderLayout.CENTER);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>JTextArea</code> seems to consume the event since when the mouse cursor is inside it, the scrolling using wheel does not work.

Every <code>updated</code> calls a <code>paintComponent()</code> method on a different <code>JPanel</code>. So all of them should run together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong>\nI cannot use the first approach as this causes messages loss of maybe important messages (received on 2nd port). What I need is, when a normal Msg is received just process it and do the painting, doesn't matter how many new normal messages (on 1st port) come in. But even if only one Msg on 2nd port is received, the application needs to process that one, regardless what is going on in the normal receiver thread.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I am facing two problems here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I need to make each thread waiting until the painting is finished, as that is UDP I can process a normal packet, and forget about all following normal packets, during the painting actions. When done, process the next normal packet.</p></li>\n<li><p>If a packet on 2nd port is received, break all normal packet processing actions and do the things needed to process the special packet.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Problem (1) is solved using a BitSet in the MainIncomingClass. Every Listener uses some kind of callback function to indicate that its done with painting and sets a specific Bit in the BitSet. If not all are true, I do not process any new Packet, just let them go.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","gui","executable-jar"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":91,"score":1,"question_id":12896193,"title":"Compile and Run Java code from Swing GUI","body":"<p>I am building a GUI in Java (Swing) and I have to execute Java code from that.

However when try to fill any particular cell with color and export it on PDF output, all the grid lines are invisible. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SimpleTableDemo.java</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.swing.table;\n\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Component;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.GridLayout;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\nimport javax.swing.JTable;\nimport javax.swing.border.LineBorder;\nimport javax.swing.table.TableCellRenderer;\nimport javax.swing.table.TableColumn;\nimport javax.swing.table.TableColumnModel;\n\nimport com.itextpdf.text.Document;\nimport com.itextpdf.text.PageSize;\nimport com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfContentByte;\nimport com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfTemplate;\nimport com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfWriter;\nimport com.swing.data.BorderCellRenderer;\n\npublic class SimpleTableDemo extends JPanel implements ActionListener  {\n    private boolean DEBUG = false;\n    private int spacing = 6;\n    private Map columnSizes = new HashMap();\n    String[] columnNames = { \"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Sport\", \"# of Years\",\n            \"Vegetarian\" };\n\n    Object[][] data = {\n            {\n                    \"Kathy\",\n                    \"Smith\",\n                    \"SnowboardingXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n                    new Integer(5), new Boolean(false) },\n            { \"John\", \"Doe\", \"Rowing\", new Integer(3), new Boolean(true) },\n            { \"Sue\", \"Black\", \"Knitting\", new Integer(2), new Boolean(false) },\n            { \"Jane\", \"White\", \"Speed reading\", new Integer(20),\n                    new Boolean(true) },\n            { \"Joe\", \"Brown\", \"Pool\", new Integer(10), new Boolean(false) } };\n\n    final JTable table = new JTable(data, columnNames);\n\n    public SimpleTableDemo() {\n        super(new GridLayout(0, 1));\n\n        table.setPreferredScrollableViewportSize(new Dimension(500, 70));\n        // table.setFillsViewportHeight(true);\n\n        // Create the scroll pane and add the table to it.\n        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(table);\n\n\n        BorderCellRenderer cellRenderer = new BorderCellRenderer();  \n        cellRenderer.setBorder(new LineBorder(Color.BLACK));\n\n        table.setDefaultRenderer(Object.class, cellRenderer);\n        table.repaint();\n\n\n        // Add the scroll pane to this panel.\n        add(scrollPane);\n\n        JButton button = new JButton(\"Create Pdf\");\n        button.addActionListener(this);\n        add(button);\n\n\n    }\n\n    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)\n    {\n        print();\n    }\n\n     private void print() {\n            Document document = new Document(PageSize.A4.rotate());\n            try {\n              PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream(\"D:/jTable.pdf\"));\n\n              document.open();\n              PdfContentByte cb = writer.getDirectContent();\n\n              cb.saveState();\n\n              PdfTemplate pdfTemplate = cb.createTemplate(table.getWidth(), table.getHeight());\n              Graphics2D g2 = pdfTemplate.createGraphics(table.getWidth(), table.getHeight());\n              /*g2.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n              g2.drawRect(x-2, y-2, table.getWidth()+2, table.getHeight()+2);*/\n              table.print(g2);\n\n              cb.addTemplate(pdfTemplate, 20, 20);\n              g2.dispose();\n              cb.restoreState();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n              System.err.println(e.getMessage());\n            }\n            document.close();\n          }\n\n    /**\n     Create the GUI and show it.

My requirement is not to display table headers. I didn't want to print headers as expected. That's why my 1st row top border and 1st column left is missing. To correct this I manually added a default grid border to 1st column and row. This makes the top border looks dark gray. Apart from this I also have to fill cells with color. It looks good when I print it to a buffered image but later on the pdf it removes my grid lines from the below screenshots:-</p>\n\n<p>JTable to bufferedImage output\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/98OSr.jpg\" alt=\"BufferedImage JTable print output:-\"></p>\n\n<p>JTable to pdf output\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OvAjW.jpg\" alt=\"jTable pdf output\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","gui","swing"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1246,"score":9,"question_id":148728,"title":"Scrollable JDesktopPane?","body":"<p>I'd like to add scrolling capability to a <code>javax.swing.JDesktopPane</code>.
