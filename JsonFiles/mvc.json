I have a view <code>show.html.erb</code> that all of these models inherit. </p>\n\n<p>The controllers all use InheritedResources, so I have access to some helper variables such as <code>resource</code>, which I use to display the attributes for the model being shown through <code>resource.attributes</code> in my parent view.</p>\n\n<p>What I would like to be able to do is whitelist which attributes are being shown in each model. I have thought of two ways to do this... the first is to define some method in a class my model's inherit from, say it is called <code>attr_visible</code> and define each attribute in the model. The reason I don't like this approach is that it puts too much of the view logic in the models. I would rather provide my views with the model, and let the view determine what is displayed.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach is what this question is about. I want to have a file <code>/app/views/users/show.html.erb</code>, and set which attributes for a User I would like to be shown, say something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@attributes = [:name, :email, :etc]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then pass them to the parent view which I described in the beginning of this question. That view would then be able to loop through <code>@attributes</code> and display the attributes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to use a \"<code>super</code>\"-type method from views? Everything I have read about view inheritance suggests the view is loaded based on where it is located in the directory structure, and then after that you're out of luck.</p>\n\n<p>edit: I have sort of done what I want. I defined a partial _show.html.erb in the /app/views/users directory that looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;% @attributes = ['name', ...] %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then in the parent view I call <code>&lt;%= render \"show\" %&gt;</code> before looping through <code>@attributes</code>.

Or should the graphic be generated in the view, cuz at the end its display logic?</p>\n\n<p>What about controllers?

Until now I was using Doctrine for Object Relation Mapping and this was nice. At first it looked as the best way to setup your MVC. The way I was using it was something like this, I had folder Application/Model and this is where I would put all of the Model files, like Doctrine Entities, Services that would do some global tasks, validators etc... So Model was a folder where all of the meat of the MVC application would go. And then I would register Model folder as library with SPL Class loader and I was able to get any entity like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$users = new \\Application\\Model\\Entity\\User();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I decided to not use ORM since I dont really like it anymore, I wont talk about why but lets just say I want to use raw SQL instead of ORM. Now the question is what would be a proper way to organize my folder structure to achieve this?</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking about creating new folder Tables in Model folder so I can have something like this: Application\\Model\\Tables\\User.php , and from that PHP file I can access all the actions on User table, like update, get, insert etc...</p>\n\n<p>Now the question is how would I organize my Model folder to use RDMS but without using ORM?\nSince Model is a layer, and Model should have Domain Objects and Data Mappers. Domain objects are objects representing current application Domain objects and Mappers would persist those Domain objects. How could I organize this to use raw SQL, but without ORM, and without building my own ORM?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any good framework that dosent use ORM or Active Record pettern so I could explore his code to see how are they doing this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","mvc","routing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":2,"question_id":2987513,"title":"How to show route default value?","body":"<p>I have a route:</p>\n\n<p><code>\n\"{culture}/{controller}/{action}/{id}\",\nnew { culture = \"en\", controller = \"Home\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }\n</code></p>\n\n<p>The Url becomes\n<code>\n<a href=\"http://mysite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mysite.com</a>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>I want to show the culture name so that the url will look like this:\n<code>\n<a href=\"http://mysite.com/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mysite.com/en</a>\n</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["objective-c","ios","mvc","database-design","core-data"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":0,"question_id":13197263,"title":"Core Data: Traverse managed objects relationships with an abstract entity in-between","body":"<p>I have the following Core Data model, in which <code>ProFormaPeriod</code> is a subclass of the <strong>abstract entity</strong> <code>FiscalPeriod</code>.

Some people believe the model should be very small, and only contain ActiveRecord (or some other ORM) and small things like <code>validates</code> and <code>belongs_to</code>, so model's are only a couple lines long.</p>\n\n<p>I personally think the model can play a larger role in apps. For example, I need to notify a user frequently throughout my app. The notifications can trigger from multiple controllers. They all send a notification to a user based on his or her notification settings, which is an object accessible through the user model.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to make something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  #validations, relationships, etc\n\n  def notify(event)\n    notif = Notification.new\n    notif.type = event.type\n    notif.to = self.id\n    # etc\n\n    if notif.save\n      # send the notification based on the settings\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would make it possible from any controller to use <code>@user.notify</code> to deliver messages to a user. This makes things really clean, but I realize there is some logic in my model. Not to mention the model makes another model.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach I wouldn't mind is creating the notification and sending it through that object. So controllers could do <code>Notification.new(:to =&gt; @user.id, ...)</code> and then deliver the message via a <code>Notification.send</code>. This would also put some logic in the Notification object so it knows how to send itself. In fact, I might like this approach better than creating the notification object through the User model.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mind these small bits of logic in the Model to make things convenient when sending messages from multiple controllers. Is this the best way to go about it? I suppose a more purist method is to include a NotificationHelper module in each controller that sends notifications?</p>\n\n<p>edit: I've been reading a bit about \"domain logic\" in models. It seems like this is encouraged, and I suppose the <code>notify</code> or <code>send</code> methods are considered domain logic.

These have to be implemented in a custom way (which can get tricky if one wants to stick with mostly declarative syntax on the view).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>MVP</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9j5Wl.png\" alt=\"MVP\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pro: the presenter still contains all of the business logic together with the view logic and can be (unit)tested by itself. No data binding is needed in this approach.</li>\n<li>Con: both the View and the Presenter code will be more verbose than in the case of MVVM as they now have to notify each other on status changes. The View needs to forward events onto the Presenter and the Presenter has to update the View when its state changes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>MVC</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2J3NX.png\" alt=\"MVC\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pro: the View is very lightweight and no data binding is needed for this approach either.</li>\n<li>Con: the Controller has to register and handle input events (e.g. keyboard and mouse events) as well as contain the business logic. Compated to the ViewModel in MVVM and the Presenter in MVP this class would be the most bloated and somewhat more difficult to (unit) test.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on these I would choose MVP to build this app. Could you agree with this or contradict?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","ajax","mvc","design-patterns"],"answer_count":9,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2696,"score":7,"question_id":719040,"title":"Kohana - where do you put AJAX scripts?","body":"<p>I am using <a href=\"http://kohanaphp.com/\">Kohana</a> but this question applies to Rails, CI, or any other MVC web development framework.

Data retrieval, business logic, wiring and validation were mainly responsibilities of the server side. </p>\n\n<p>I have few questions regarding <em>AngularJS</em> framework that were produced by following quotes I read:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_02\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>AngularJS tutorial</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Angular apps, we encourage the use of the Model-View-Controller\n  (MVC) design pattern to decouple the code and to separate concerns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia Model–view–controller</a></em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Model–View–Controller (MVC) is an architecture that separates the\n  representation of information from the user's interaction with\n  it. The model consists of application data and <strong>business rules</strong>,\n  and the controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the\n  model or view</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>AngularJS</em> uses client side <code>MVC</code> pattern. So my question is, whether is it safe that business logic resides on client side? Can we trust the client? How is validation done (just client)?</p>\n\n<p>If we have, for example, traditional server side MVC application, business rules would be on server side and the validation would be on the client and server side (1 request less for validation).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would be the best way to write a robust AngularJS application? MVC on client side and some kind  of MC (model, controller) on server side?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Does that means, that MODEL and CONTROLLER are in one way duplicated (client/server)?</p>\n\n<p>I know my question is somehow weird, but I think the reason is, that I am somehow acustomed to traditional server side MVC pattern. I am sure there is someone, that have already done same transition.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","mvc","cookies","session-cookies"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1061,"score":0,"question_id":5200731,"title":"IE 8 will no longer accept cookies from localhost","body":"<p>I had to disable cookies for some testing in a web application.  now for some reason in IE I cannot get cookies working on localhost any more.

I hope you get the picture.</p>\n\n<p>I know about authorization in ASP.NET MVC and I know that I can build my own custom IAuthorizationFilter. However, <strong>my authorization filter has to access the database</strong> (DbContext in my case) in order to check whether the entity being edited/deleted, i.e. BlogPost number 5 is owned by the currently logged in user. In other words, the currently logged in user can only edit and delete his \"stuff\".

What is the \"best practices\" way to <strong>access the database from within a custom IAuthorizationFilter</strong>? Should I somehow inject my IRepository (the interface serving my DbContext) into the authorization filter attribute? Should I try to find my IRepository from the Controller from within the OnAuthorization method of my filter? Is it ok to access the DB from within a filter in the first place?\n2. If using an IAuthorizationFilter for this task is not the \"best practices\" way to do this, then what is?</p>\n\n<p>So to summarize:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make sure that the currently logged user can edit/delete only his \"stuff\", if every \"stuff\" knows the user that owns it?</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mvc","iis7","url-rewriting","web-config"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"question_id":13081673,"title":"404 page when defining Controller and Action in custom PHP MVC in IIS","body":"<p>I am building a custom PHP MVC framework based on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw28-krO7ZM\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw28-krO7ZM</a> (Create Your Own MVC - Jream), however I am using IIS as my local webserver.

So, I'll break my simulation into two parts:</p>\n\n<p>1) The simulation engine</p>\n\n<p>2) The simulation model</p>\n\n<p>Basically I want a little help (tips/advice) about how to split it up i.e. what goes where.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm thinking that the engine will keep track of time. It will listen for events and when events arrive it will update the state of the simulation ( I'm building a discrete event simulation). The simulation model will have the GUI and it will get the logic and data from the actual engine. I'm thinking that the model will provide the actual events as input to the engine. I've been thinking about a car analogy where the engine is the body of the car and the model the driver. So I want it to behave like the driver(model) telling the car(engine) what to do i.e. when to turn when to break and what speed to go at etc</p>\n\n<p>Do you think I'm tackling this in the right way? I can sense that I sound a little confusing and not very clear. So I'll just clarify that what I'm looking for is just some input to how I should split this up and what the responsibility of engine and model should actually be.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I was wondering, if I were to implement the MVC design pattern, how would that fit in with the way I'm trying to break it up?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>By model I mean that I want the simulation to have a set of specific rules which the engine then follows. As I'm building a road traffic simulator, the rules could be like, the distribution of cars, driver profiles, what cars may and may not do ( e.g. stop for red light) etc. So the model is like the \"brain\" of the simulation if you get what I mean, and then the engine being the actual simulation of the set of \"rules\" specified by the model.

As an example, consider that they want to change the website template (Exactly, the css of template) in the nights and days, and now for that, they create an MVC Controller/Action like this <code>/CssController/Style</code> and link it in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;link href='/CssController/Style' /&gt;\n        ...\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, they manage this business in the controller, for example changing the <code>body</code> background, for nights set <code>background-color: black;</code> and for days <code>background-color: white;</code>.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if ((foundEvent = repoEvent.GetEventById(id)) == null) {\n    return HttpNotFound(\"Could not find event with id {0}.\".FormatWith(id));\n}\n\nvar assessment = isSample ? foundEvent.SampleAssessment : foundEvent.ActualAssessment;\nif (assessment == null) {\n    return HttpNotFound(\"Could not find {0}assessment for event with id {1}\".FormatWith(isSample ? \"sample \" : \"\", id));\n}\n\nif (assessment.UnmappedCaseStudiesCount == 0) {\n    TempData[TempDataKeys.ErrorMessage.GetEnumName()] = \"This assessment (\\\"{0}\\\") has no case studies!\".FormatWith(assessment.Name);\n    return RedirectToAction(\"Index\", \"Events\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In all the cases above, it seems to me that the logic does belong in the controller because the controller is setting up error messages rather than returning a view (this is re-enforced by the fact that things like <code>HttpNotFound</code> and <code>RedirectToAction</code> are members of the <code>Controller</code> class, and so are unavailable to classes that don't extend <code>Controller</code>).

Now is allowed to call a method in the Model from the \"UpdateLabel\" method in the View, so the View can use the value that's stored in the Model?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for reading and responding to my question!</p>\n"},{"tags":["mvc","events","backbone.js"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12959541,"title":"What is the best way for showing a loading bar/spinner when a backbone collection is being fetched?","body":"<p>Good day!</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have been into backbone/require, and getting to learn some really cool stuff.

I <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/170295/how-should-i-architect-my-model-and-data-access-layer-objects-in-my-website/170297\">asked a question on Programmers</a> similar to this and got a response about <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1974735/what-exactly-is-persistence-ignorance\">Persistence Ignorance</a> (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/905498/what-are-the-benefits-of-persistence-ignorance\">more here</a>) and the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Repository</a> pattern, which both seem to be concepts from the Microsoft world.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell \"Persistence Ignorance\" is simply the concept of having Model objects that know nothing about your Data Storage mechanism, and the Repository pattern seems very similar to the Data Mapper pattern, except that it <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/804751/what-is-the-difference-between-the-data-mapper-table-data-gateway-gateway-da#answer-814479\">may be more of a facade</a>, hiding more of what's actually going on.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n\n<p><em>In the Data Mapper pattern should I have one Mapper per Model object? Rather than having one for the entire configuration tree?</em></p>\n\n<p>And therefore, should I have a configuration tree building object that uses all those Mapper objects?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class ConfigBuilder() {\n    public ConfigBuilder (productMapper, propertyMapper, optionMapper, conditionMapper) {\n        // save them into local properties\n    }\n\n    public Products() {\n       var products = productMapper.FetchAll();\n\n       foreach (var product in products) {\n           AddProperties(product);\n       }\n\n        return products;\n    }\n\n    private AddProperties(products) { /* ... */ }\n    private AddOptions(property) { /* ... */ }\n    private AddConditions(option) { /* ... */ }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does this seem like a good solution?</p>\n\n<p><em>Where should the logic to build the objects be located?</em></p>\n\n<p>At some point there needs to be a considerable amount of logic to build my configuration objects from the random array of XML data that I get back from the Soap service, and a smaller amount of logic to do the same from the database.</p>\n\n<p>Should I be putting the logic to build the objects in separate instances of the Mapper objects?</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IProductMapper { FetchAll; FetchByCode; Create; Delete; Update  }\n\nclass ProductMapperXml implements IProductMapper {\n    public ProductMapperXml(xmlDataSource) {}\n    public FetchAll() { /* A whole bunch of logic to create the Product objects from XML data source */ }\n}\n\nclass ProductMapperDatabase implements IProductMapper {\n    public ProductMapperDatabase(databaseConnection) {}\n    public FetchAll() { /* Select and build products from the database */ }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this okay? Should this logic be abstracted further? If so why? Also, I'm a bit uneasy about the <code>ProductMapperXml</code> object having considerable logic itself and also being responsible for creating <code>Product</code> objects internally. Should I be passing it a <code>ProductFactory</code> of some sort? Or just use a factory method?</p>\n\n<p>Please please let me know if there are more elegant ways to solve this than my suggestions?

The other way around, I can tell the GSON google code to convert JSON to a particular Java object. There does not seem to be a one liner way to do this in PHP. I am not talking about the stdClass object, but a model.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","mvc"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":2,"question_id":12995459,"title":"New to Rails: How are you using application_controller.rb in your rails app?","body":"<p>I am just getting into rails and begining to understand it slowly.

Entity objects have circular references, and when you return an IEnumerable from an Ajax callback it generates an exception from the JavascriptSerializer if there are circular references.  This happens because the MVC Grid uses a JsonResult which in turn uses JavaScriptSerializer which does not support serializing circular references.  </p>\n\n<p>My solution to this problem has been to use LINQ to create view objects that do not have the Related Entites.  This works for all cases, but reqires the creation of new objects and the copying of data to / from entity objects to these view objects.  Not alot of work, but it is work.</p>\n\n<p>I have finally figured out how to generically make the grid not serialize the circular referneces (ignore them) and I wanted to share my solution for the general public, as I think it is generic, and plugs into the environment nicely.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The solution has a couple of parts</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Swap the default grid serializer with a custom serializer</li>\n<li>Install the Json.Net plug-in available from Newtonsoft (this is a great library)</li>\n<li>Implement the grid serializer using Json.Net</li>\n<li>Modify the Model.tt files to insert [JsonIgnore] attributes in front of the navigation properties</li>\n<li>Override the DefaultContractResolver of Json.Net and look for the _entityWrapper attribute name to ensure this is also ignored (injected wrapper by the poco classes or entity framework)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of these steps are easy in and of themselves, but without all of them you cannot take advantage of this technique.  </p>\n\n<p>Once implemented correctly i can now easily send any entity framework object directly to the client without creating new View objects.  I dont recommend this for every object, but sometimes it is the best option.

Also if you are using code first then you can manually place the [JsonIgnore] attributes in front of any attribute that creates a circular reference.</p>\n\n<p>Search for the region.Begin(\"Navigation Properties\") in the .tt file.

A treeview is defined within the view, and it takes the populated treestore as its store. However, when the view comes up. The data is not in the treeview. I beleive this may have something to do with all the static config loading before initComponent runs, although I am not sure. If I could get some insight on that process, it would be very helpful. I am thinking I say this.store1 belongs to the view in the view config, but then define this.store1 within the views initComponent. Is this the wrong way to do it???</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Using ExtJs 4.1.1</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mvc","joomla","joomla2.5"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":2,"question_id":12974421,"title":"Change default view of controller using view-list member: How to set view models?","body":"<p>I'm building a Joomla 2.5 component, and I want to change the view being rendered after a 'save' item action.

While in edit it should be a Drop Down for options (there's only three). This stays blank dispite what I do.<br/>\n3) Deletion: Press a button to blow away a row. I put the button there but it's a copy of the JS for editing. What do I need to use to have it be deletion?<br/>\n4) Dates: This doesn't work at all. One of the weird parts is that from the SQL server's type of Date, it gets changed to DateTime in the Entity and stays that way throughout.

I want to get this right from day one, and I would like to kick off a discussion here to help me implement Uncle Bob's <a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Architecture</a> in my architectural design.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick run-down of our tech stack, top to bottom (the technology isn't importance, the structure is):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oracle Database</li>\n<li>Oracle Service Bus exposing services using WSDLs</li>\n<li>JAX-WS generated Java-classes from the WSDLs (let's call this the \"generated service layer\")</li>\n<li>A Domain module consisting of POJOs mapped to the generated data objects</li>\n<li>A Consumer-module exposing the \"generated service layer\" to the front-end application</li>\n<li>A Spring MVC based front-end module using FreeMarker to render the views</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A key point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Attempting to adhere to Bob's Clean Architecture, I've gone back and forth a bit with myself regarding where to place the <em>application logic</em>, namely the \"Use Case\"-layer in his architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the approach I've come up with:</p>\n\n<h2>Layer 1 - Entities</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is where our Domain module containing the <em>domain-objects</em> lives, these are self-containing objects with minimal dependencies on each other. Only logic pertaining to the objects themselves may live on these domain objects, and no use-case specific logic.</p>\n\n<p>Access to our database is exposed via WSDLs using a service bus that transforms the data, as opposed to an ORM like JPA or Hibernate. Because of this, we do not have \"entities\" in the traditional sense (with Ids), but a <em>data-centric approach</em> making this layer a data access layer, presented to the rest of the application by the Consumer-module.</p>\n\n<h2>Layer 2 - Use Cases</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The software in this layer contains application specific business rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is where logic specific to our application's use cases lives. Changes to this layer should not affect the data access layer (layer 1). Changes to the GUI or framework implementation (Spring MVC) should not affect this layer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is where it gets a little tricky:</strong>\nSince our data access layer (in layer 1) must be kept clean of application logic, we need a layer that facilitates use of that layer in a fashion that suits the use cases. One solution I've found to this problem is the use a variant of the \"<em>MVVM-pattern</em>\" that I choose to call <em>MVC-VM</em>. See below for an explanation. The \"VM\"-part of this lives in this Use Case-layer, represented by <code>*ViewModel</code>-classes that encapsulate this Use Case-specific logic.</p>\n\n<h2>Layer 3 - Interface Adapters</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The software in this layer is a set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is where the MVC-architecture of our GUI lives (the \"MVC\" in our \"MVC-VM\"). Essentially this is when the <code>Controller</code>-classes get data from the <code>*ViewModel</code>-classes and puts it in Spring MVC's <code>ModelMap</code> ojects that are used directly by the FreeMarker-templates in the View.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, the servicebus would in our case also fall in under this layer.</p>\n\n<h2>Layer 4 - Frameworks and Drivers</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Generally you don’t write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates to the next circle inwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This layer is really just a configuration-layer in our application, namely the Spring configuration. This would for example be where we specify that FreeMarker is used to render the view.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Model View ViewModel Pattern</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MVVM facilitates a clear separation of the development of the graphical user interface (either as markup language or GUI code) from the development of the business logic or back end logic known as the model (also known as the data model to distinguish it from the view model). The view model of MVVM is a value converter meaning that the view model is responsible for exposing the data objects from the model in such a way that those objects are easily managed and consumed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More on the MVVM-pattern at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The MVC-VM roles would be fulfilled in our application like so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Model</strong> - represented simply by the <code>ModelMap</code> datastructure in Spring MVC that is used by the view templates.</li>\n<li><strong>View</strong>  - FreeMarker templates</li>\n<li><p><strong>Controller</strong> Spring's <code>Controller</code>-classes that directs <em>HTTP URL requests</em> to specific <em>handlers</em> (and as such functions as a FrontController). The handlers in these classes are responsible for fetching data from the use case-layer and pushing it out to the view templates when showing data(HTTP <code>GET</code>), as well as sending data down for storing (HTTP <code>POST</code>). This way it essentially functions as a <em>binder</em> between the ViewModel and View, using the Model.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>ViewModel</strong> - These classes are responsible for 1) structuring data from the data access layer in a fashion that is usable by the View and 2) treat data-input from the View. \"Treat\" means to validate and to break down the data so that it can be sent down the stack for storing. This layer would take form as <code>&lt;UseCase&gt;VM</code>-classes in a <code>viewmodel</code> package in our Spring MVC front-end module.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A key component here is the implicit binding that happens in Spring MVC between <code>ModelMap</code> and the FreeMarker-templates. The templates only use the model (<code>ModelMap</code>s), where the controller has put the data in a format it can use. That way we can make templates like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user}!&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:\n  &lt;a href=\"${latestProduct.url}\"&gt;${latestProduct.name}&lt;/a&gt;!\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I apologize for the verbose explanation, but I could not explain this (relatively simple) architecture in fewer words. </p>\n\n<p>I would greatly appreciate some input on my approach here - am I on the right track? Does the MVC-VM thing make sense? Am I violating any Clean Architecture Principles?</p>\n\n<p>There are of course many solutions to this, but I am trying to find a solution that is 1) not over-engineered and 2) adheres to the principles of Bob's Clean Architecture.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n\n<p>I think the key issue that puts me off here is what form the \"Use case\" layer takes in this application. Remember we have an MVC front-end that gets data from a data access layer. If the MVC part fits in Bob's \"Interfaces adapters\", and the domain models of the data layer fit in Bob's \"Entities\" layer, then what do I call the use case classes that implement application logic? I am tempted to just call them <code>&lt;UseCase&gt;Model</code>s and put them in the MVC project, but according to Bob</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so that means my model objects should be \"dumb\" (like a simple <code>Map</code>. <code>ModelMap</code> in Spring) and it is then the responsibility of the controller to put data from the Use Case class into this Map-structure. </p>\n\n<p>So again, what form does my Use Case-classes take? How about <code>&lt;UseCase&gt;Interactor</code>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>But in conclusion</strong> I realize that the MVC-MV-thing is over-engineering (or simply incorrect) - as \"mikalai\" indicates below this essentially just a two-layer applcation in its current form; a data access layer and a front-end MVC layer. Simple as that.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc","mvc","asp.net-mvc-3"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":8,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1862,"score":8,"question_id":4947854,"title":"How to get the column titles from the Display(Name=) DataAnnotation for a strongly typed list scaffold view at runtime?","body":"<p>how do i get the [Display(Name=\"Some Title\")] DataAnnotations \"Some Title\" rendered in the List scaffold view's output?</p>\n\n<p>I create a strongly typed list scaffold view for this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CompanyHoliday\n{\n    [Key]\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [Display(Name = \"Datum\")]\n    [DataType(System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.DataType.Date)]\n    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n\n    [Required]\n    [StringLength(50)]\n    [Display(Name = \"Feiertag Name\")]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The view looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@model IEnumerable&lt;Zeiterfassung.Domain.CompanyHoliday&gt;\n\n@{\n    ViewBag.Title = \"Year\";\n}\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Year&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    @Html.ActionLink(\"Create New\", \"Create\")\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;\n        Date\n    &lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;\n        Name\n    &lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n@foreach (var item in Model) {\n&lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n        @Html.ActionLink(\"Edit\", \"Edit\", new { id=item.Id }) |\n        @Html.ActionLink(\"Details\", \"Details\", new { id=item.Id }) |\n        @Html.ActionLink(\"Delete\", \"Delete\", new { id=item.Id })\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n        @String.Format(\"{0:g}\", item.Date)\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n        @item.Name\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n}\n\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However i don't want \"Date\" and \"Name\" in the table header - i want \"Datum\" and \"Feiertag Name\" rendered there dynamically. </p>\n\n<p>The actual column header titles should come from the Display Dataannotation.</p>\n\n<p>How to do this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, toebens</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc","asp.net-mvc-3","mvc","architecture","service-layer"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":15,"up_vote_count":20,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":2997,"score":19,"question_id":8735466,"title":"Fat model / thin controller vs. Service layer","body":"<p>I have been developing enterprise applications for many years using .Net \nMy apps usually have a domain model containing entities mapping to SQL DB tables.\nI use a Repository pattern, Dependency injection and a service layer.</p>\n\n<p>Recently we started working on MVC 3 projects and we had a debate where to put which logic.\nI came accross thin Controller / FAT Model architecture and was wondering how the service layer would fit in</p>\n\n<h2>Option 1 - Model talks to services</h2>\n\n<p>Controller is thin, calls methods on the models.

All proceeds well generating/rendering the view, and then a user updates a number of values on the client side and it's time to update the server. </p>\n\n<p>As an example, let's say it's a simple container view model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Data {\n  public List&lt;Prop&gt; Props { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Prop {\n  public string Id { get; set; }\n  public int Value { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So let's just say the user is adding new props to the container.  How do I get the modified object back to the server?  </p>\n\n<p>So far: If it's important that the server be in sync realtime, I can make a call with each addition/update on the server and then either keep things in sync on the client or simply have the server return the updated view.  For simple scenarios like that, all is well.</p>\n\n<p>But I find myself often in the case where I want the client to be able to manipulate the object (through the view/js/etc) and I don't really need to update on the server until they are done and submit.  What I really want is to be able to pass the object down with the rendered view, interact with it via Javascript, and then pass the object back to the controller when all is done.  How do I that?  (Apologies it took a while to get to the point!)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatives I've seen:</p>\n\n<p>-- Quick &amp; Dirty (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9741445/encode-viewmodel-properties-to-javascript-in-razor):  Which sure will put the object in javascript on the client, though it seems hack-ish to just be serializing the whole object into the client side html without any validation, etc.  (Though I do realize eventually that's how the object is making it's way down, but it seems like you're bypassing the whole MVC4 object handling/parsing.)</p>\n\n<p>-- Upshot.Js seemed promising with MS support at one time, but it seems that has died: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12238855/current-status-of-upshot-js\">Current status of Upshot.js</a></p>\n\n<p>-- Breeze.js (http://www.breezejs.com/) seems to be an attempt to take over there, though my concern there is that it's fairly new and not much broad adoption yet.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately the thing that makes me feel like I'm missing what must be a somewhat obvious alternative is that all the pieces are clearly built into MVC4 already.  When you use a form view for example, your fields are databound to the controls, and when the form is submitted, a parallel JSON object is created, sent to the controller, and then parsed into your POCO ViewModel object for you.  That's basically the roundtrip I'm looking for (though retaining the full JSON object clientside).

The <code>BookDataMapper</code> could have a generic <code>get()</code> method that accepts condition(s) such as the book's unique identifier, author name, etc. This implementation is fairly trivial (logically), but what if we want to have multiple conditions that require a more complex query?</p>\n\n<p>Lets say we want to get all book written by a certain author under a specific publisher. We could expand the <code>BookDataMapper-&gt;get()</code> method to parse out multiple conditions, or we could write a new method such as <code>BookDataMapper-&gt;getByAuthorAndPublisher()</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Is it preferable to have the service layer call these [more specific] methods directly, or have the conditions parsed before calling the more generic <code>BookDataMapper-&gt;get()</code> method with multiple conditions passed? In the latter scenario, the service layer would do more of the logical \"heavy lifting,\" leaving the data mapper fairly simple. The former option would reduce the service layer almost entirely to just a middle-man, leaving conditional logic to the data mapper in methods like <code>BookDataMapper-&gt;getByAuthorAndPublisher()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious concern with letting the service layer parse the conditions is that some of the domain logic leaks out of the data mapper.

I've research other similar questions here in SO, and read up on HMVC, and in principle it seems like it might answer my questions, but it seems more interface-driven than framework-driven (if that makes sense?) I've also looked at other frameworks like Kohana, but I'm not quite grasping how their module system and routing to multiple controllers in the same module work.</p>\n\n<p>Any insights or suggestions on how to effectively implement a module system without introducing a Front Controller or re-parsing a request would be much appreciated.

The selection lists do not get refreshed after each selection due to AJAX.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, would I have a controller called Selection to populate the lists and another called Output to create the table of records?

Is this right?","body":"<p>The way it was explained was through the use of events and the publish/subscribe model. Basically, the model would just be the data and it would have no knowledge of the view/GUI/UI. The model is typically just an abstract object that operates on its data and can perform operations and whatnot.</p>\n\n<p>The view is a different class that responds to changes in the model and usually displays this data to the user. Previously, I did not know how this could occur without coupling between the view and model but having it explained with events clears that confusion up a lot. Does this mean that the model contains public events that itself raises when something interesting happens? For example, if we were programming a game of Chess, when a piece was moved, the model would raise the event of <code>PieceMoved</code> with the necessary information (which piece, moved from where to where, etc.) and the view could subscribe to such an event and then show an animation of the piece moving from its old square to its new square.</p>\n\n<p>The part that still confuses me is the exact nature of the controller. I'm having trouble understanding how it supplies the model and view with new information. I imagine the controller contains references to the model and view. Keeping with the Chess example, would the controller just respond to user input (for example to move a piece) and then just suggest to the model what piece wants to move to where? Then the model takes this information, sees if it's a legitimate move, and if so, update the model accordingly, raise the <code>PieceMoved</code> event, to which the view reacts and updates the graphical realm accordingly?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, how does the controller find out which piece is trying to be moved? It seems like that type of thing is heavily tied to the view (let's say moving involved first clicking the piece you wish to move and then the destination square). I imagine the controller would respond to a mouse click and sends those coordinates to the model but how would the model know how to translate those coordinates to find which piece was selected? Isn't that heavily tied to the view? It seems like the view would have to perform some logic processing instead of simply responding to the model and controller but then it wouldn't be a proper view anymore (instead a view/model mix).</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mvc"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12762049,"title":"Expression MVC2","body":"<p>I use expression in Java MVC <br />\n<code>&lt;p&gt;${i}&lt;/p&gt;</code> <br />\nI define a method <br /></p>\n\n<pre><code>public static String test(int i) {\n    //\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can't call method <code>test</code> in Expression\n<code>${test(i)}</code> \nHow to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","mvc","backbone.js","angularjs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":87,"score":1,"question_id":12762574,"title":"backbone-style models in angularjs?","body":"<p>I apologize if this question has already been answered elsewhere, but I couldn't find a full, obvious (to me, at least) solution.</p>\n\n<p>I have experience with the idea of a Model in backbone.

Let's say there are project -> milestones -> tasks.  </p>\n\n<p>What we need:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>get them all - all the projects with all the milestones with all the tasks in a nested json encoded array.</li>\n<li>get only the projects </li>\n<li>get only the milestones</li>\n<li>get only the tasks  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the last three, we can have separate controllers that provide us with the corresponding data. The problem shows up when we try to \"get them all\" in a nested json-encoded array.  </p>\n\n<p>What is probably the best way to handle that?  </p>\n\n<p>I thought of a few possibilities:<br>\n - Move the project, milestone and task generators in helper classes - this means we call them from the individual controllers and also call them when we need to get them all<br>\n - From the view of the projects, call the controller/view of the milestones (of each project) [which in turn calls the controller/view of the tasks (of each milestone)]. This might look like a simulation of 3 requests in 1.   </p>\n\n<p>The motivation comes from the fact that while I could fetch all the projects and then the milestones of each and then the tasks of each milestone, it would take a lot of requests. If we could get all the calls in one, it would take considerably less time to get the data, let alone that in one request the data is more organized.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","mvc","frontend","barebones"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1849,"score":6,"question_id":9494468,"title":"Backbone.js frontend with RESTful Rails backend?","body":"<p>I started in the web development world with PHP, and then Rails in the recent few years.

My thinking was that because these lower level controllers were still interacting with the view, that they should remain controllers rather than models or drivers.</p>\n\n<p>What I found, however, is that each instance of a controller also spawns a new instance of CI.  So I would have 3 or 4 instances of CI running for each request.  Ton of overhead, and also caused session issues.</p>\n\n<p>I have since moved these lower level controllers into the library as drivers.  They now capture the CI instance in the construct method, and make modifications to it.  This makes it VERY nice to work with, and doesn't require the HMVC extension.  The drivers are not externally callable either, so it allows me to funnel all requests through specific entry points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is whether this is structurally correct.</strong>  I have always held the notion that drivers should only modify the data they are provided through their method calls, but many of these drivers will pull information directly from GET and POST, and while they will not directly append to the View, they are often accessing view files, and passing the processed view to the CI instance for output.</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] <em>A little more context:</em>\nOne of the drivers I have created is essentially a user login driver called 'Access'.  It makes calls to the 'User' model for create/login/logout methods.  The driver uses the POST data to check the User model, then loads the correct view with errors and whatever is needed.  The idea, being, with 2 lines, I can include this driver in any controller throughout the project, so there is a significant decrease in code redundancy.  Again, I know that the drivers should be confined to their scope, however the driver does not modify anything outside it's scope, but simply returns the view it has created.</p>\n\n<p>Is there another method to for doing this that is more inline with straight MVC?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","mvc","jqgrid","row"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":81,"score":0,"question_id":12299041,"title":"mvc jqgrid without asp - javascript-worked- creating row using tab key","body":"<p>now i can create new row using tab key and can do sorting in columns\nmy script for creating new row\nIn the last editable column of your colModel, write these dataEvents.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dataEvents: [\n{\n    type: 'keydown',\n    fn: function (e) {\n        var key = e.charCode || e.keyCode;\n        if (key == 9)//tab\n        {\n            // var grid = $('#rowed5');\n            grid.jqGrid('saveRow', selIRow, false, 'afterSaveCell');\n            // grid.jqGrid('editCell', selIRow, false, 'clientArray');\n            var a = grid.getDataIDs().length;\n            var b = a + 1;\n            // var ip = 1;\n            if (a == grid.getDataIDs().length) {\n                grid.addRowData(b, { \"id\": b, \"desc\": \"your description\", \"stock\": \"0.0\", \"unitp\": \"0.0\", \"linet\": \"0\" });\n                setTimeout(\"jQuery('#rowed5').editCell(\" + a + \" + 1,2, true);\", 100);\n                grid.jqGrid('editCell', selIRow, false, 'clientArray');\n                grid.jqGrid('editRow', b, false, 'clientArray');\n                grid.jqGrid('saveRow', b, false, 'afterSaveCell');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>also make sure you got </p>\n\n<pre><code>editurl: 'clientArray',\ncellEdit: true,\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in your program.</p>\n\n<p>editCell is used to set focus on the first editable cell of jqgrid.</p>\n\n<p>when i got, just thought of sharing here...</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net","mvc","asp.net-mvc-3","iis7"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2746,"score":5,"question_id":6123731,"title":"Random Session Timeout in ASP.NET MVC3","body":"<p>i have an application which gets random session timeouts.

This is done so that the distributed pieces of my application can all reference the same type of service interfaces and contracts which is very nice. </p>\n\n<p>I have setup a StructureMap container to inject my dependencies in the following manner, by specifying a ServiceContext, which will house all of the Service Interface properties so that they can be referenced int he application later.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IServiceContext\n{\n\n}\n\npublic class ServiceContext: IServiceContext\n{\n    public IAuthenticationService AuthenticationService { get; set; }\n    public ServiceContext(IAuthenticationService authenticationService)\n    {\n         AuthenticationService = authenticationService;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I have my StructureMapControllerFactory which looks like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class StructureMapControllerFactory:DefaultControllerFactory\n{\n    protected override IController GetControllerInstance(RequestContext requestContext, Type controllerType)\n    {\n        if (controllerType == null) return null;\n        return ObjectFactory.GetInstance(controllerType) as IController;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this is configured in my global.asax like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()\n    {\n        ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(new StructureMapControllerFactory());\n        AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();\n        RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters);\n        RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);\n\n        Configure();\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wanted to decouple my services as much as possible from my appliction, so I have implemented the following ServiceFactory class that handles providing proxies to StructureMap when the IoC container is configured:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public  static class ServiceFactory\n{\n    private static readonly ClientSection _clientSection = ConfigurationManager.GetSection(\"system.serviceModel/client\") as ClientSection;\n\n    public static T Create&lt;T&gt;()\n    {\n        T context = default(T);\n        foreach(ChannelEndpointElement endpoint in _clientSection.Endpoints)\n        {\n            if(endpoint.Contract == typeof(T).FullName)\n            {\n                IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; assignables = typeof (Binding).Assembly.GetTypes().Where(p =&gt; typeof(Binding).IsAssignableFrom(p));\n                Type bindingType = assignables.Single(p =&gt; p.Name.ToLower().Equals(endpoint.Binding.ToLower()));\n                context = ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt;.CreateChannel((Binding)Activator.CreateInstance(bindingType, false), new EndpointAddress(endpoint.Address));\n            }\n        }\n        return context;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows me to pull directly from the config file when creating proxies so I do not need to select \"Add Service Reference\" (as that is technically adding a dependency).</p>\n\n<p>In my global.asax, I can now configure my StructureMap Container like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected void Configure()\n    {\n        ObjectFactory.Configure(x =&gt;\n        {\n            x.Scan(scanner =&gt; scanner.AddAllTypesOf&lt;IController&gt;());\n            x.For&lt;IAuthenticationService&gt;().Use(ServiceFactory.Create&lt;IAuthenticationService&gt;());\n            x.For&lt;IServiceContext&gt;().Use&lt;ServiceContext&gt;();\n\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Although I was initially able to use this in the following manner:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IAuthenticationService service = ServiceContext.AuthenticationService.Authenticat(...);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am now unable to start my application without exceptions being thrown such as the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>StructureMap configuration failures:\nError:  104\nSource:  Registry:  StructureMap.Configuration.DSL.Registry, StructureMap,  Version=2.6.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=e60ad81abae3c223\nType Instance '685e2e2a-f271-4163-a6fa-ba074e4082d1' (Object:   DMT.WCF.Contracts.Authentication.IAuthenticationService) cannot be plugged into type   DMT.WCF.Contracts.Authentication.IAuthenticationService, DMT.WCF.Contracts,  Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not sure why this is occuring.

Or maybe by calling a dispatchEvent and on the controller having a <code>postAction</code> function?</p>\n\n<pre><code>//on the phtml file\n&lt;div&gt;\n     &lt;?php\n          $request['url'] = getRequest()-&gt;getServer(‘HTTP_REFERER’);\n          Mage::dispatchEvent(\"allpagescontroller\", $request);\n     ?&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The controller will instantiate my model and call the setters to update/insert neeeded values</p>\n\n<pre><code>//on the controller\nfunction postAction ($params)\n{\n    $referer = $this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getPost();\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>On the model I will have all the appropiate code to do the CRUD operations</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is this correct? I'm trying to follow the Magento MVC approach by following these steps. For now I've all the code on the phtml file. I'm getting the referer, splitting it and instantiating the model to save everything. But I know this is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>On config.xml for now I have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;config&gt;\n    &lt;modules&gt;\n        &lt;Dts_Allpages&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/Dts_Allpages&gt;\n    &lt;/modules&gt;\n    &lt;global&gt;\n      &lt;models&gt;\n          &lt;allpages&gt;\n              &lt;class&gt;Dts_Allpages_Model&lt;/class&gt;\n              &lt;resourceModel&gt;allpages_mysql4&lt;/resourceModel&gt;\n          &lt;/allpages&gt;\n          &lt;allpages_mysql4&gt;\n                  &lt;class&gt;Dts_Allpages_Model_mysql4&lt;/class&gt;\n                &lt;entities&gt;\n                  &lt;keywords&gt;\n                      &lt;table&gt;keywords&lt;/table&gt;\n                  &lt;/keywords&gt;\n                  &lt;referencedpages&gt;\n                      &lt;table&gt;referencedpages&lt;/table&gt;\n                  &lt;/referencedpages&gt;\n              &lt;/entities&gt;\n          &lt;/allpages_mysql4&gt;\n        &lt;/models&gt;\n        &lt;blocks&gt;\n            &lt;allpages&gt;\n                &lt;class&gt;Dts_Allpages_Block&lt;/class&gt;\n            &lt;/allpages&gt;\n        &lt;/blocks&gt;\n        &lt;helpers&gt;\n            &lt;allpages&gt;\n                &lt;class&gt;Dts_Allpages_Helper&lt;/class&gt;\n            &lt;/allpages&gt;\n        &lt;/helpers&gt;\n        &lt;resources&gt;\n            &lt;allpages_write&gt;\n                &lt;connection&gt;\n                    &lt;use&gt;core_write&lt;/use&gt;\n                &lt;/connection&gt;\n            &lt;/allpages_write&gt;\n            &lt;allpages_read&gt;\n                &lt;connection&gt;\n                    &lt;use&gt;core_read&lt;/use&gt;\n                &lt;/connection&gt;\n            &lt;/allpages_read&gt;\n        &lt;/resources&gt;\n    &lt;/global&gt;&gt;\n    &lt;frontend&gt;\n      &lt;routers&gt;\n          &lt;allpages&gt;\n              &lt;use&gt;standard&lt;/use&gt;\n              &lt;args&gt;\n                  &lt;module&gt;Dts_Allpages&lt;/module&gt;\n                  &lt;frontName&gt;allpages&lt;/frontName&gt;\n              &lt;/args&gt;\n          &lt;/allpages&gt;\n      &lt;/routers&gt;\n        &lt;layout&gt;\n            &lt;updates&gt;\n                &lt;allpages&gt;\n                    &lt;file&gt;allpages.xml&lt;/file&gt;\n                &lt;/allpages&gt;\n            &lt;/updates&gt;\n        &lt;/layout&gt;\n    &lt;/frontend&gt;  \n&lt;/config&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["forms","spring","mvc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":12597627,"title":"how do I prevent spring mvc overwriting sessionattributes from request","body":"<p>I have an MVC spring application where the user logs on, this stores a User @SessionAttribute , which I refer to subsequently e.g. when updating a Customer object in a POST request I want the session User info to add to this object.\nMy problem is when I access the @ModelAttribute(\"user\") User object in the customer POST, spring has bound request parameters into it i.e. the User.name has the value of the Customer.name from the submitted form.</p>\n\n<p>NB I've kind of hacked this in that all controllers are subclasses of my AppController, which is where the @SessionAttributes are declared.

One of the elements of the object is a set of limited choices - a perfect candidate for a drop down list.</p>\n\n<p>But if I use a SelectList in my model, and a drop down list in my View, and then try to post the Model back to my Create method, I get the error \"Missing Method Exception:No Parameterless constructor for this object\".  Exploring the MVC source code, it appears that in order to bind to a model, the Binder has to be able to create it first, and it can't create a SelectList because there is no default constructor for it.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the simplified code:\nFor the model:</p>\n\n<pre><code> public class DemoCreateViewModel\n{\n    public SelectList Choice { get; set; }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>      //\n    // GET: /Demo/Create\n\n    public ActionResult Create()\n    {\n        DemoCreateViewModel data = new DemoCreateViewModel();\n        data.Choice = new SelectList(new string[] { \"Choice1\", \"Choice2\", \"Choice3\" });\n        ViewData.Model = data;\n        return View();\n    }\n\n    //\n    // POST: /Demo/Create\n\n    [HttpPost]\n    public ActionResult Create(DemoCreateViewModel form)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            // TODO: Add insert logic here\n\n            return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n        }\n        catch\n        {\n            return View();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And for the View:</p>\n\n<pre><code>      &lt;fieldset&gt;\n        &lt;legend&gt;Fields&lt;/legend&gt;\n        &lt;%= Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Choice) %&gt;\n        &lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.Choice, Model.Choice) %&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I know I can MAKE this work by dropping back 10 yards and punting: bypass model binding and drop back to the FormCollection and validate and bind all the fields myself, but there's got to be a simpler way. I mean, this is about as simple a requirement as it gets.  Is there a way to make this work within the MVC ModelBinding architecture?  If so, what is it?  And if not, how come?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Well, I have egg on my face, but maybe this will help someone else. I did some more experimenting and found a simple solution that seems to work.</p>\n\n<p>Provide a simple value (string or integer, depending on what your select list value type is), and name that as the model element that you bind to. Then provide a second element as the select list of choices, and name it something else. So my model became:</p>\n\n<pre><code> public class DemoCreateViewModel\n{\n    public string Choice { get; set; }\n    public SelectList Choices { get; set; }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then the DropDownListFor statement in the View becomes: </p>\n\n<pre><code>            &lt;%= Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.Choice, Model.Choices) %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I do this, the submit button correctly binds the choice made in the form to the string Choice, and submits the model back to the second Create method.</p>\n"},{"tags":["entity-framework","mvc"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12596115,"title":"Entity Framework code-first not generating database in SQL Server","body":"<p>I am new to EF code first approach, what I am trying to do is just inserting a record but somehow the database fails to generate in my SQL Server when my SubmitResult method is executed.

Since I have no data layer in sense of (for example) database (data is generated during execution based on user input) I am concerned about way of using MVC in this implementation. So far I have came up with two approaches:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>GUI is the View. GeneticAlgorithm is the Controller. GeneticAlgorithmResults is the Model (as class that only stores data). Basic flow:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The View sends user input to the Controller;  </li>\n<li>The Controller is processing user input and generates data;  </li>\n<li>The Controller sends generated data to the Model;  </li>\n<li>The Model notifies the View about new data;  </li>\n<li>The View pulls new Data and updates the display.  </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>GUI is the View. AppEngine is the Controller. GeneticAlgorithm nad GeneticAlgorithmResults are the Model. Now we have:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The View sends user input to the Controller;  </li>\n<li>The Controller is processing user input and sends control signals to the Model.  </li>\n<li>The Model updates its internal state (generates new data);  </li>\n<li>The Model notifies the Controller about new data;  </li>\n<li>The Controller pulls data to model;  </li>\n<li>The Controller processes data;  </li>\n<li>The controller pushes processed data to the View;  </li>\n<li>The View updates the display.  </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>First approach seems to be more straightforward and more like MVC. The problem is that some logic would have to be in the Model - decide when to notify the model as not all data updates will be displayed, or maybe display will be updated with the sets of data not every little change. Those decisions will be based on user input. Whats more some additional processing of the data may be needed before actual display. This would be in the View.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand second approach seems to be more complicated and looks like to much messages are being passed to achieve the task. But it gives full control of Logic to the Controller and separates responsibilities of the View, the Controller and the Model (which is the main purpose of MVC).  </p>\n\n<p>Which approach would you recommend? Or maybe I should mix them and use first approach architecture with communication flow from second approach?

It is called ColumnFilter and it is available here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-column-filter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-column-filter/</a></p>\n\n<p>Using this plugin is really easy. Right after declaring the DataTable, it is configured like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>oTable.columnFilter({\n  aoColumns: [\n    { type: \"number-range\" },\n    { type: \"text\" },\n    { type: \"text\" }\n  ]\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When actually filtering the datasource serverside, I need to know what types has been set in the columnfilter plugin. The reason behind this is, that I encapsulated a generic approach for filtering that basically allows me to do this on an entity in the serverside controller action:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Function DataProviderAction(ByVal dataTableParams As JQueryDataTableParamModel) As JsonResult\n  Return GetJson(dataTableParams, Request.Params,\n    Function(r) New String() {\n      Convert.ToString(r.Id),\n      r.Description,\n      r.Comment})\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works due to the fact that the controller is derived from a generic basecontroller Of T. The GetJson method expects a Lambda expression for the creation of a string array. The rest (filtering, sorting and paging) is done in a couple of extension methods on IQueryable(Of T).</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere down the road there exists a strategy that holds a couple of specific filter implementations that are independent of the actual type.

The TreeView class has a method called onDoubleClick which will call the open method of the doubleClicked nodes Control.</p>\n\n<p>How would you implement it.I currently have a solution but I don't know if it's good:\nTreeView.onDoubleClick will check the id of the asocieted TreeViewControl and the doubleClicked node and according to it's id and node, it will call BaseNodeControl.open() or BaseNodeControlX.openEditor(). BaseNodeControl.open() will be overwritten in BaseNodeControlX and will open the TreeViewX.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

After reading more articles on MVC, I discovered that the Model doesn't really pass the data back to the Controller; rather, it <strong>fires</strong> an event, which allows the Controller to call the proper View. <br />\nMy question centers on this <strong>event firing</strong> part: <br /> <br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;Q.1: Must an event really be fired? Once the Model completes its processing, and returns control to the Controller, can't the Controller simply call the View? <br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;Q.2: In an actual implementation, a Model object is injected into a Controller class. So, Model object basically has no idea what Controller called it. How does it know what Controller to fire an event to? And how do we know what Controller is expecting that notification? <br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;Q.3: The Controller calls the View, injecting it with the current Model object, so the View can use it to obtain the needed data. Is this correct or wrong? If wrong, why is it wrong, and what is the proper way to do it? <br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;I have read my questions on MVC on here and other sites, viewed MVC diagrams, but I haven't been able to really connect the dots the way it's supposed to be connected. <br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","mvc","properties","frameworks","entity"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":12464423,"title":"Issue in mapping fragments MVC 3 EF Code first","body":"<p>i've recently added a new property to one of my models:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public HttpPostedFile AvailabilityImage { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, upon doing so I'm now getting this very strange error:</p>\n\n<p><code>error 3004: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 32:No mapping specified for properties FloorModel.AvailabilityImage in Set Floor</code></p>\n\n<p>I am at a loss on how to solve this, I've never had this issue adding properties before?</p>\n\n<p>Is it to do with the Data type being used with this property do you think?

I am using MVC4 and EF5. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an overview of what I am trying to do...</p>\n\n<p>I have two entities, Site and SiteType. Each Site can have multiple SiteTypes so they have a Many-to-Many relationship. I setup the database with a typical Many-to-Many relationship by creating 3 tables, Site, SiteType and SiteSiteType. SiteSiteType just contained 2 columns, the  SiteId and the SiteType Id.</p>\n\n<p>I updated the Entity Model and it worked perfectly creating my entities like this for Site...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public partial class Site\n{\n    public Site()\n    {\n        this.SiteTypes = new HashSet&lt;SiteType&gt;();\n    }\n\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public string Address { get; set; }\n\n    public virtual ICollection&lt;SiteType&gt; SiteTypes { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this for SiteType</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>public partial class SiteType\n{\n    public SiteType()\n    {\n        this.Sites = new HashSet&lt;Site&gt;();\n    }    \n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }    \n    public virtual ICollection&lt;Site&gt; Sites { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now I am using a strongly typed view, however instead of using Site as the type, i am using a custom ViewModel I created called SiteViewModel which looks like this...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>public class SiteViewModel\n{\n    public Site Site { get; set; }\n    public bool WasPosted { get; set; }\n    public IEnumerable&lt;SiteType&gt; AvailableSiteTypes { get; set; }\n    public IEnumerable&lt;SiteType&gt; SelectedSiteTypes { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason for this is I want to use the CheckBoxList extension for MVC as described <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/292050/CheckBoxList-For-a-missing-MVC-extension\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"here\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>Now everything works when I am creating a new Site and adding SiteTypes to it, however when I tried to edit and existing record i started having problems. </p>\n\n<p>Here is my edit GET method in the controller....</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public ActionResult Edit(int id = 0)\n    {\n        Site site = _repository.GetSiteByID(id);\n        if (site == null)\n        {\n            return HttpNotFound();\n        }\n\n        var model = new SiteViewModel();\n        model.AvailableSiteTypes = _repository.GetSiteTypes();\n        model.SelectedSiteTypes = site.SiteTypes;\n        model.Site = site;\n\n        return View(model);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the post method originally looked like this....</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [HttpPost]\n    public ActionResult Edit(SiteViewModel siteViewModel, int[] siteTypes)\n    {\n\n        if (ModelState.IsValid)\n        {\n            _repository.UpdateSite(siteViewModel.Site, siteTypes);\n            _repository.Save();\n            return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n        }\n\n        siteViewModel.AvailableSiteTypes = _repository.GetSiteTypes();\n        List&lt;SiteType&gt; selectedSiteTypes = _repository.GetSiteTypes(siteTypes).ToList();\n        if (selectedSiteTypes.Count &gt; 0)\n        {\n            siteViewModel.SelectedSiteTypes = selectedSiteTypes;\n        }\n        return View(siteViewModel);\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the problem I was having was that siteViewModel.Site was being populated properly from the form with the updated data, however the Id column was being set to \"0\" even though it was an existing record and not a new one.

I have a record type \"person\", which contains information about membership.  Members come in two types: adults &amp; kids.  With the kids, SOME of them we know their ages and they are divided into age groups.  The age groups have names (e.g. \"8 &amp; Under\".)  So as an example, John Smith &amp; Jane Smith have two kids Jimmy Smith and Janey Smith.  Janey wants to do a soccer program, so we need to know her age and put her in an age group.  Jimmy is doing arts &amp; crafts so we don't need to know his age because his program isn't divided by age.

I could:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>put an int agegroup field in the person table, and define the values as CONST values when I define the model for people (and probably have a special value for \"undefined\" - for the adults.

I want to edit the <code>Bar</code>s inside the <code>show</code> view of <code>Foo</code>'s controller. Also, I don't want to reload the entire page each time I edit a <code>Bar</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, I'm using AJAX. The <code>Bar</code> controller has two views - <code>show</code> and <code>edit</code>. <code>bar#show</code> has an edit button, and both the <code>Bar</code> views, instead of reloading the entire page, use AJAX to perform the HTTP request and then replace the content of the HTML tag that contains that represents that specific <code>Bar</code> object in the <code>Foo</code>'s <code>show</code> view.</p>\n\n<p>When rendering <code>foo#show</code>, I don't want to perform an HTTP request for each <code>Bar</code> object. Also, <code>Bar</code>'s controller method need to fetch the <code>Bar</code> record from the database - something I don't want to do in <code>foo#show</code>, because I can load all of them with a single query, which is much faster than loading each one separately.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I did is to make <code>Bar</code>'s views partials instead of normal views. That way, I can render them both from the controller and from another view.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is that those views need more preparation beside loading the <code>Bar</code> record from the database, and unlike loading the record - those preparations need to be done whether the partial is rendered from the controller or from another view.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm doing now is having a ruby block of about 10 lines in the beginning of the partial's <code>erb</code>, and do the preparation there. While that works, I realize it's a bad design - that kind of preparation should be done in controllers, not in views. And to make things worse - sometimes, that preparation code of the <code>show</code> partial can decide that the <code>edit</code> partial needs to be rendered instead, so I need to call another partial render from the <code>show</code> partial - again, something that should have been done in another place.</p>\n\n<p>However, I just don't know where to put that code. I thought about putting it a view helper, but view helpers are supposed to be called from views, and I also need to call this one from a controller.</p>\n\n<p>So, what's the RoR way to solve this problem?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mvc","jsp","java-ee"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":0,"question_id":12423990,"title":"Can't add data to the database","body":"<p>I'm working on a simple java web application using mvc 1.\nThe application add data inserted in the table form.\nwe have \n1.Bean\n2.Operator which is a class that insert data from jsp to database\n3.servlet\n4.jsp</p>\n\n<p>This is the bean</p>\n\n<pre><code>package pk1;\n\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class MissionForm {\n\n    String objet, dateDepart,dateRetour;\n    long matricule, numVehicule,numMission ;\n    public MissionForm(String objet, String dateDepart, String dateRetour,\n            int matricule, int numVehicule,int numMission) {\n        super();\n        this.objet = objet;\n        this.dateDepart = dateDepart;\n        this.dateRetour = dateRetour;\n        this.matricule = matricule;\n        this.numVehicule = numVehicule;\n        this.numMission=numMission;\n    }\n    public String getObjet() {\n        return objet;\n    }\n    public void setObjet(String objet) {\n        this.objet = objet;\n    }\n    public String getDateDepart() {\n        return dateDepart;\n    }\n    public void setDateDepart(String dateDepart) {\n        this.dateDepart = dateDepart;\n    }\n    public String getDateRetour() {\n        return dateRetour;\n    }\n    public void setDateRetour(String dateRetour) {\n        this.dateRetour = dateRetour;\n    }\n    public long getMatricule() {\n        return matricule;\n    }\n    public void setMatricule(long matricule) {\n        this.matricule = matricule;\n    }\n    public long getNumVehicule() {\n        return numVehicule;\n    }\n    public void setNumVehicule(long numVehicule) {\n        this.numVehicule = numVehicule;\n    }\n    public long getNumMission() {\n        return numMission;\n    }\n    public void setNumMission(long numMission) {\n        this.numMission = numMission;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Operator that adds typed data from jsp to database </p>\n\n<pre><code>package pk1;\n\n\nimport java.sql.*;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.Vector;\n\n\npublic class Operateur {\n\n    public Operateur(){}\n\n    //------------------ajouter les Missions------------------------\n\n    public void addMission(String objet,String dateDepart,String dateRetour,long matricule,long numVehicule){\n        Connection conn=Utilitaire.getConnection();\n        String req=\"insert into mission (Objet,DateDepart,DateRetour,Matricule,NumVehicule) values(?,?,?,?,?)\";\n        try {\n            PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement(req);

Like having the first window save that data in the model, and then when the second one needs them request them from the model.</p>\n\n<p>Third Question: I was considering of using the Observer/Observable pattern. How would that be used in this example to open the last window? I mean since (I think) the Controller is the class that opens the second window, would that mean that the Listener would have to be Observed and the second window would have to be an Observer so that the Listener would say </p>\n\n<pre><code> notifyObservers(\"openSecondWindow\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then the second window would see that and open itself?</p>\n\n<p>Finally: I heard that a PropertyChangeListener could work as well, and that it is sometimes preffered over the Observer/Observable Pattern.

I worked on Java MVC projects and they were clean and simple. This is however a complete mess IMO. Examples online such as NerdDinner and projects discussed on ASP.Net are too basic, hence why they \"simply\" work. Excuse if this sounds negative, but this is my experience so far.</p>\n\n<p>I have a repository and a service that speaks to the repository. Controllers call service. </p>\n\n<p>My data layer is NOT persistence independent, as the classes were generated by SQL metal. Because of this I have a lot of unnecessary functionality. Ideally I'd like to have POCO, but I didn't find a good way to achieve this yet. </p>\n\n<p>*<em>Update: Of course Microsoft hasn't messed anything up - I did. I didn't fully understand the tools that were at my disposal. The major flaw in what I have done, was that I have chosen a wrong technology for persisting my entities. LINQ to SQL works well in stateful applications as the data context can be easily tracked. However, this is not a case in stateless context. What would be the right choice? Entity Framework code first or code only work pretty well, but what's more importantly, is that it shouldn't matter. MVC, or front end applications must should not aware of how data is persisted.  *</em></p>\n\n<p>When creating entites I can use object binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult Create(Customer c)\n{\n    // Persistance logic and return view\n}    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works great, MVC does some binding behind the scene and everything is \"jolly good\". </p>\n\n<p><strong>It wasn't \"Jolly Good\". Customer was a domain model, and what was worse, it was dependent on persistence medium, because it was generated by SQL metal. What I would do now, is design my domain model, which would be independent of data storage or presentation layers. I would then create view model from my domain model and use that instead.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As soon as I'd like to do some more complex, e.g. - save Order which is linked to the customer everything seems to break:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [HttpPost]\n    public ActionResult Create(Order o)\n    {\n        // Persistance logic and return view\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To persist an order I need Customer or at least CustomerId. CustomerId was present in the view, but by the time it has got to Create method, it has lost CustomerId. I don't fancy sitting around debugging MVC code as I won't be able to change it in a hosting envrionment either way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, a bit of moaning here, sorry. What I would do now, is create a view model called NewOrder, or SaveOrder, or EditOrder depending on what I'm trying to achieve. This view model would contain all the properties that I'm interested in. Out-of-the-box auto binding, as the name implies, will bind submitted values and nothing will be lost. If I want custom behaviour, then I can implement my own \"binding\" and it will do the job.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alternative is to use FormCollection:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult Create(FormCollection collection)\n{\n   // Here I use the \"magic\" UpdateModel method which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, at least for LINQ Entities.               \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is used in books and tutorials, but I don't see a point in a method which has an alternative: TryUpdateModel - if this crashes or model is invalid, it attempts to update it either way. How can you be certain that this is going to work?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Autobinding with view models will work the most of the time. If it doesn't, then you can override it. How do you know it will always work? You unit test it and you sleep well.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another approach that I have tried is using ViewModel - wrapper objects with validation rules. This sounds like a good idea, except that I don't want to add annotations to Entity classes. This approach is great for displaying the data, but what do you do when it comes to writing data? </p>\n\n<pre><code>[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult Create(CustomViewWrapper submittedObject)\n{\n    // Here I'd have to manually iterate through fields in submittedObject, map it to my Entities, and then, eventually, submit it to the service/repository.\n}    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>** View model is a good way forward. There would have to be some mapping code from view model to the domain model, which can then be passed to the relevant service. This is not a correct way, but it's one way of doing it. Auto mapping tools are you best friends and you should find the one that suits your requirements, otherwise you'll be writing tons of boilerplate code.**</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something out or is this the way Microsoft MVC3 should work? I don't see how this is simplifying things, especiialy in comparisson to Java MVC.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sorry if this sounds negative, but this has been my experience so far. I appreciate the fact that the framework is constantly being improved, methods like UpdateModel get introduced, but where is the documentation? Maybe it's time to stop and think for a little bit? I prefer my code to be consistent throughout, but with what I have seen so far, I have no confidence whatsoever that this is a right way forward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I love the framework.

The objects are created by a fetch request to the context or by inserting a new one into the context. In the apps I've seen, the objects are empty aside from properties that correspond to their attributes in the database, essentially making them objects that mimic a row in the entity's table.</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense that those automatically generated classes and CoreData itself make up the applications model. In the apps I've made traditionally, there is instead a <code>Model</code> class that is in charge of handling all of the data. This is often a Singleton class, and each controller that needs the model can simply use <code>self.model = [Model sharedInstance];</code>. For bigger apps, there may be multiple models instead of one gigantic one. You get the picture. I guess my first question is: am I right? CoreData and it's associated NSManagedObject's make up the entire model for an application?</p>\n\n<p>I would guess that is wrong, because an application may need other functionality that deals with data that does not have an assigned CoreData object. For example: what if a CoreData application needs to populate a table view with data that is retrieved through an HTTP request from foo.com/test (let's say it is JSON data). This data does not need to be stored in CoreData, but at the same time, I don't think retrieving and parsing the data is a job for a controller. Should there be an object, <code>FooDataManager</code> (or something like that) that handles the HTTP requests to manage data from foo.com (it could extend AFHTTPClient). And then controllers that deal with foo.com have a property for <code>fooDataManager</code>, which acts as a model for that controller? And then controllers will call <code>[self.fooDataManager retrieveAndParseData];</code>?</p>\n\n<p>I want to verify this information before I start developing CoreData apps so that I do it correctly from the start. In web development, I'm used to having one model for each controller, but it seems like on iOS, there can be many models that all do their own thing, many controllers who use those models, and all of those models are in addition to CoreData and the NSManagedObjects.</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc-3","linq","mvc","razor","linq-to-entities"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":0,"question_id":12324771,"title":"LINQ To Entities cannot generate string MVC Razor","body":"<p>When Using LINQ to get information I use the following method</p>\n\n<pre><code>var salt_water_disposals = _SaltWaterDisposals.SaltWaterDisposals.Select(sw =&gt; new SaltWaterModel\n            {\n\n                saltwater_ID = sw.SaltWaterDisposalID,\n                lease = sw.Lease.LeaseName,\n                field = sw.Lease.Field.Name.ToLower(),\n                permitter_fluid = sw.PermittedFluids.Count == 0 ? \"None\" : sw.PermittedFluids.Aggregate(\"\", (current, c) =&gt; current+c.Fluid.Name),\n                max_gas_pressure = sw.MaxGasInjectionPressure,\n\n            });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However when I run the code I get the following error because of the PermittedFluids:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'System.String\n  Aggregate[PermittedFluid,String](System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<code>1[FieldPro.Domain.Entities.PermittedFluid],\n  System.String,\n  System.Func</code>3[System.String,FieldPro.Domain.Entities.PermittedFluid,System.String])'\n  method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have tried using it also as a ToString() but I get the same error.</p>\n\n<p>Any Ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Any Help would be appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","linq","asp.net-mvc-3","mvc","entity-framework"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2202,"score":4,"question_id":8496429,"title":"LINQ to Entities only supports casting Entity Data Model primitive types?","body":"<p>I'm trying to populate a dropdown in my view.

Possible URLs could be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.site.com/sofas/overview\nwww.site.com/video-games/overview\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the first URL, the \"sofas\" controller is loaded, and the overview() method of it is executed. This all works well until we have to nest these products within parent catagories. I'll take the two previous URLs to demonstrate what I mean:</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.site.com/furniture/sofas/overview\nwww.site.com/electronics/video-games/overview\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the \"video-games\" controller is nested within the \"electronics\" controller. However, with the current 'load controller -> execute action' structure this won't work. </p>\n\n<p>A possible solution would be to create a method within the parent controller (\"electronics\") which gets executed in case an unexisting action is requested (\"video-games\"). This method checks whether the requested action exists as a controller. If so, the controller gets loaded and the action (\"overview\") of it gets executed.</p>\n\n<p>I fruitlessly searched for solutions to this limitation of the standard front controller pattern, including <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11962437/multi-level-controllers-for-mvc-architecture\">here</a> on SO. I think my implementation of MVC is now correct, but the front controller still brings limitations.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","linq","mvc","razor"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":71,"score":2,"question_id":12301046,"title":"MVC Razor brackets inside code block","body":"<p>I'm having issues do linq queries inside of a code block.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@{\n  var foo = @Model.Things.Select((value, index) =&gt; new { value, index });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is the new{}, it sees the second bracket as closing the entire code block.

Where is the best place/practice to introduce caching layer? One way to do it is in the controller, so code caching layer as another mapper, and if this cache mapper doesn't return data, we can then go the long way to retrive stuff from external. But this solution means I will need to put all those logics all over the controller actions, maybe there is a better way to place caching layer?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Initial Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are in the process of designing/creating a RESTFul API project on top of PHP MVC framework.

I see other questions regarding routing issues, as well as JSon, and jQuery seems to be a popular way to enhance web development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>\nI have a jQuery-UI datepicker that calls a Controller/Action/ID and returns json data to the datepicker.

The code passes the URL that is generated and passed to the jQuery is:\n/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999</p>\n\n<p>We are using Umbraco, with a directory called /Secure within the Umbraco area to hold our MVC code. The URL that the code tries then generates on the Dev environment is:\n/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999\nIf I watch the call and the errors in Firebug, I see that an error for the following:\nPOST <a href=\"http://dev.ourcompanyname.com/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.ourcompanyname.com/Secure/Validation/getDisabledDates/999</a>       302 Found (if I investigate further, I find it was really a 404, that got sent to the error page, and that's what was found.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm using @Url.Action in the view to get the correct (hopefully) URL to the action, but when the javascript request is made in the Dev environment, the return is a 404. The code gets into the javascript code and displays the URL in an alert, which looks right to my eyes. The code does not seem to get as far as the MVC controller (I tried putting a messagebox there).</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be because the controller isn't actually a distinct, real page within a directory, because the MVC code is compiled into a DLL. I've heard this and it makes sense, but other people in the world seem to be calling controllers, so I'm not sure what my problem is here.</p>\n\n<p>Originally there was only one set of dates, so some code calls only say GetDates, but then it was broken up by Widget, so calls then reflect ByWidget, so an ID is passed.
