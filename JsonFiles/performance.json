However, as the source code is quite substantial, going ahead with this replacement would be a significant undertaking; and so my question is just this:</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone actually measured the performance difference between the old Collection and a .NET Dictionary? Is such a comparison, for whatever reason, inappropriate? It certainly seems that everything we are currently doing with the Collection we could do with a Dictionary; basically I just want to know if it makes sense for us to go through the code and make this transition, or if doing so would essentially be a waste.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Originally in the question I referred to the current Collection we are using as a VB6 Collection. After reading the first two answers I realize it is more accurately a Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection, which appears to be a class introduced for compatibility between VB6 and VB.NET. I think the question still holds.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the first link provided in Kenneth Cochran's answer, I am led to believe that a Dictionary would indeed be better suited to our purposes than a Collection as it performs better at retrieving items by key and running \"For Each\" loops by several milliseconds for 10,000 runs. At our company, this is a realistic scenario; there are lots of places in the code with statements like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim ETF as ETFdetails = ETFcoll(sym)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And as I said, these lines execute on hundreds of products, many times per second. With this in mind I am inclined to think we really should go ahead and make the change, then measure any performance difference. I expect that we will see at least a mild but noticeable improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything obviously wrong with what I've just said? If so, point it out!</p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","math","prolog","logic","clpfd"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":262,"score":3,"question_id":10925285,"title":"Faster implementation of verbal arithmetic in Prolog","body":"<p>I already made a working generalized <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic\" rel=\"nofollow\">verbal arithmetic</a> solver in Prolog but it's too slow.

My first series of tests resulted in an average of 300 req/s using this test plan.</p>\n\n<p>The page in question is accessing the following table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>create table [dbo].[Entries]\n(\n    [Id]                   int                 not null        identity(1,1)\n    /* other columns here, about 10 in total */ \n);\n\nalter table [dbo].[Entries] add constraint [PK_Entries] primary key ([Id]);\nalter table [dbo].[Entries] add constraint [DF_Entries_Created] default(getutcdate()) for [Created];\n\ncreate index [IX_Entries_EmailAddress] on [dbo].[Entries] ([EmailAddress]);\ncreate index [IX_Entries_NACSZ] on [dbo].[Entries] \n(\n     [FirstName]\n    ,[LastName]\n    ,[Address1]\n    ,[City]\n    ,[State]\n    ,[Postal]\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The page executes only two queries:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select 1 where exists \n(\n    select 1 from Entries\n     where EmailAddress = @EmailAddress\n        or (\n                    FirstName       = @FirstNAme\n                and LastName        = @LastName\n                and Address1        = @Address1\n                and City            = @City\n                and State           = @State\n                and Postal          = @Postal\n           ) \n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<pre><code>insert into Entries\n(\n    ...\n)\nvalues\n(\n    ...\n);\n\nselect cast(scope_identity() as int);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Performance testing on my machine (quad core, 8GB ram, local SQL 2012 express install) yields up to 800 req/s, so I was rather shocked to see a peak of about 300 req/s on Azure's servers. I chalked this up to resource contention on the database server, and added the necessary code to support sharding. The sharding mechanism uses a consistent hash on one of the key fields to determine which connection string to use (out of 3 possible, currently). The goal here was to split the database load across 3 Azure SQL databases and up the concurrency factor on the app.</p>\n\n<p>I have verified that the sharding mechanism works (approximately equal number of entries end up in each database) and have stripped all non-essential code from the page so that all that is happening is the two queries noted above. I'm using the default isolation level (read commited) on the transaction. The final code looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using (var db = ConnectToShard(keyToHash))\nusing (var tx = db.BeginTransaction(IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted))\n{\n    // execute query 1\n    // if result from query 1 is null, \n    //     execute query 2\n\n    tx.Commit();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, even with all this extra work, I can't seem to push the requests/sec above ~500 or so. My ideal target is 1000. I guess I'm missing something with regard to Azure SQL performance, but I'm not sure what. Any thoughts or suggestions for improving requests/sec?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","performance","simd","neon"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":20,"score":-1,"question_id":13281995,"title":"Improve C code with Neon iOS","body":"<p>The code belotoning used to scale an image, but the performance is not good.

There are no image files in the app at all (yet). I've been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and I'm looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.</p>\n\n<h1>Game Setup</h1>\n\n<p>At a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game (towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc) are also subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.</p>\n\n<p>I keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each object's state is updated in the main game loop (fired by an <code>NSTimer</code> at 60-240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting). The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.</p>\n\n<p>I handle view updates using a <code>CADisplayLink</code> timer at the native refresh rate (60 Hz), which calls <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override <code>drawRect:</code> to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapon's new state.</p>\n\n<h1>Performance Issues</h1>\n\n<p>Testing on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS (the target frame rate), usually into the 10-20 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Using Instruments I've determined that only roughly 5% of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state -- the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the <code>CGContextDrawPath</code> function (which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done) is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.</p>\n\n<p>From some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isn't up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive (especially when drawing things that aren't opaque and have some alpha value &lt; 1.0). I'm almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but it's pretty low level and I'm not really excited to have to use it -- it doesn't seem like it should be necessary for what I'm doing here.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphics?</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>Some Ideas...</h2>\n\n<p>Someone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single <code>CALayer</code> instead of having each object on its own <code>CALayer</code>, but I'm not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a theory that using <code>CGAffineTransforms</code> to do my animation (i.e. draw the object's shape(s) in <code>drawRect:</code> once, then do transforms to move/rotate/resize its layer in subsequent frames) would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I don't think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>To give you a feel for the level of drawing I'm doing, here's an example of the <code>drawRect:</code> implementation for one of my weapon objects (a \"beam\" fired from a tower).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: this beam can be \"retargeted\" and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n\n    // Draw beam\n    CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(c, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor);\n    CGContextSetLineWidth(c, self.width);\n    CGContextMoveToPoint(c, self.origin.x, self.origin.y);\n    CGPoint vector = [TDBoard vectorFromPoint:self.origin toPoint:self.destination];\n    double magnitude = sqrt(pow(self.board.frame.size.width, 2) + pow(self.board.frame.size.height, 2));\n    CGContextAddLineToPoint(c, self.origin.x+magnitude*vector.x, self.origin.y+magnitude*vector.y);\n    CGContextStrokePath(c);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Instruments Run</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a while:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The <code>TDGreenBeam</code> class has the exact <code>drawRect:</code> implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2b1y3512341d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full Size Screenshot</a></strong>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSw3j.png\" alt=\"Instruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","performance","extjs3"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":11,"score":-1,"question_id":13281517,"title":"How to tuning performance with extjs 3.x in large web application?","body":"<p>I want to seek advice about ExtJS 3.x performance tuning.

I learned something about running time but I can't be sure what I understood is right. So please help me. </p>\n\n<p>So integer factorization is currently not a polynomial time problem but primality test is. Assume the number to be checked is n. If we run a program just to decide whether every number from 1 to sqrt(n) can divide n, and if the answer is yes, then store the number. I think this program is polynomial time, isn't it? </p>\n\n<p>One possible way that I am wrong would be a factorization program should find all primes, instead of the first prime discovered. So maybe this is the reason why. </p>\n\n<p>However, in public key cryptography, finding a prime factor of a large number is essential to attack the cryptography. Since usually a large number (public key) is only the product of two primes, finding one prime means finding the other. This should be polynomial time.

The hardware device is responsible sending out precise periodic messages onto various networks that it, in turn, connects too.  Inside the hardware device I have a couple Microchip dsPICs.  There are two modes of operation.  </p>\n\n<p>One scenario is where send simple \"jobs\" down to the dsPICs that, in turn, can send out the precise messages with .001ms accuracy.  This architecture is not ideal for more complex messaging where we need to send a periodic packet that changes based on events going on within the PC application.  So we have a second mode of operation where our PC application will send the periodic messages and the dsPICs simply convert and transmit in response.  All this, by the way, is transparent to the end user of our software.  Our hardware device is a test tool used in the automotive field.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we use a USB to serial chip from FTDI and the FTDI Windows drivers to interface the hardware to our PC software.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that in mode two where we send messages from the PC, the best we are able to achieve is around 1ms on average hardware range.  We are subjected to Windows kernel pre-emption.  I've tried a number of \"tricks\" to improve things such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Making sure our reader &amp; writer threads live on seperate CPU affinities when possible.</li>\n<li>Increasing the thread priority of the writer while reducing that of the reader.</li>\n<li>Informing the user to turn off screen saver and other applications when using our software.</li>\n<li>Replacing createthread calls with CreateTimerQueueTimer calls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All our software is written in C/C++.  I'm very familiar and comfortable with advanced Windows programming; such as IO Completions, Overlapped I/O, lockless thread queues (really a design strategy), sockets, threads, semaphores, etc...</p>\n\n<p>However, I know nothing about Windows driver development.  I've read through a few papers on KMDF vs. UDMF vs. WDM.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping a seasoned Windows kernel mode driver developer will respond here... </p>\n\n<p>The next rev. of our hardware has the option to replace the FTDI chip and use either the dsPIC's USB interface or, possibly, port the open source Linux FTDI stuff to Windows and continue to use the FTDI chip within our custom driver.  I think by going to a kernel mode driver on the PC side, I can establish a kernel driver that can send out periodic messages at more precise intervals without preemption and/or possibly taking advantage of DMA.</p>\n\n<p>We have a competitor in our business who I think does exactly something similar with their tools.  As far as I know, user space applications can not schedule a thread any better than 1ms.  We currently use timeGetTime in a thread.  I've experiemented with timer queues (via CreateTimerQueueTimer) with no real improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Is a WDM the correct approach to achieve more precise timing?</p>\n\n<p>Our competitor some how is achieveing very precise timing from Windows driven signals to their hardware and they do load a kernel driver (.sys) and their device runs over USB2.0 as does ours.</p>\n\n<p>If WDM is the way to go, can I get some advise on what kernel functions I should be studying for setting up the timings?\nThanks for reading</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","performance"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1395,"score":4,"question_id":2443164,"title":"Does variable name length matter for performance C#?","body":"<p>I've been wondering if using long descriptive variable names in WinForms C# matters for performance?

I never care about the 'added_id', I'm only using to ensure that the inserted items are clustered together on disk (since the B-Tree used to index the table in MySQL uses the primary key as the cluster index). The 'id' column contains the binary representation of a UUID -- this is the column I actually care about and all other things reference this ID. Again, I don't want the UUID to be the primary key, since the UUID is random and thus making the B-Tree created to index the table have horrible IO characteristics (at least that is what has been said elsewhere). Also, although UUID1 includes the timestamp to ensure that IDs are generated in \"sequential\" order, the inclusion of the MAC address in the ID makes it something I'd rather avoid. Thus, I'd like to use UUID4s.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, now moving on to the SQLAlchemy part. In SQLAlchemy one can define a model using their ORM for the above table by doing something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code># The SQL Alchemy ORM base class\nBase = declerative_base()\n\n# The model for table 'foo'\nclass Foo(Base):\n    __table__ = 'foo'\n    add_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\n    id = Column(Binary, index=True, unique=True, nullable=False)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this is basically the same as the SQL above. </p>\n\n<p>And now to the question. Let's say that this database is going to be sharded (horizontally partitioned) into 2 (or more) separate databases. Now, (assuming no deletions) each of these databases will have records with added_id of 1, 2, 3, etc in table foo. Since SQLAlchemy uses a session to manage the objects that are being worked on such that each object is identified only by its primary key, it seems like it would be possible to have the situation where I could end trying to access two Foo objects from the two shards with the same added_id resulting in some conflict in the managed session. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone run in to this issue? What have you done to solve it? Or, more than likely, am I missing something from the SQLAlchemy documentation that ensures that this cannot happen. However, looking at the sharding example provided with the SQLAlchemy download (examples/sharding/attribute_shard.py) they seem to side-step this issue by designating one of the database shards as an ID generator... creating an implicit bottle neck as all INSERTS  have to go against that single database to get an ID. (They also mention using UUIDs, but apparently that causes the performance issue for the indexes.)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, is there a way to set the UUID as the primary key and have the data be clustered on disk using the added_id? If it's not possible in MySQL is it possible in another DB like Postgres?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any and all input!</p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","cdn"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8,"score":0,"question_id":13260464,"title":"Is it possible to implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) if I'm with a cluster web host?","body":"<p>I'm with a webhost, a web farm or cluster, I guess you could say.

The authors introduced the concept of <strong>Warm</strong> and <strong>Cold</strong> queries and how they differ, which I also noticed myself without knowing of their existence. Here it's probably worth to mention I only have six month of experience behind my back.</p>\n\n<p>Now I know what topics I can research into additionally if I want to understand the framework better in terms of performance. Unfortunately most of the information on the Internet is outdated or bloated with subjectivity, hence my inability to find any additional information on the <em>Warm</em> vs <em>Cold</em> queries topic.</p>\n\n<p>Basically what I've noticed so far is that whenever I have to recompile or the recycling hits in, my initial queries are getting very slow.

Acknowledgment messages are sent back out over the client sockets using async <code>Socket.BeginSend</code> calls from the threads that talk to the exchange side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Observed problems:</strong> As the client count has grown (now 60-70), we have started to see intermittent delays of up to 100s of milliseconds while sending and receiving data to/from the clients. (We log timestamps for each acknowledgment message, and we can see occasional long gaps in the timestamp sequence for bunches of acks from the same group that normally go out in a few ms total.) </p>\n\n<p>Overall system CPU usage is low (&lt; 10%), there is plenty of free RAM, and the core logic and the outbound (exchange-facing) side are performing fine, so the problem seems to be isolated to the client-facing socket code. There is ample network bandwidth between the server and clients (gigabit LAN), and we have ruled out network or hardware-layer problems.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions or pointers to useful resources would be greatly appreciated.

Each member has 1-16 virtual shards, i.e. atomic units. This data tier powers a search lookup web service (on an Azure web role web server), which requires all atomic units to respond before it knows enough to answer the user response. </p>\n\n<p>Given the search parameters, the web server is able to determine the atomic unit IDs that it needs to query, but not their associated federation members (I am using USE Federation for this translation). The goal is to have the web server query all atomic units (wherever they are) as quickly as possible. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, the best solution I have for this works as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Generate list of needed atomic units.</li>\n<li>Generate USE Federation and SQL statement for each atomic unit. Currently, the best performance I have found specifies FILTERING = OFF in the USE Federation statement, while manually specifying the predicate for the atomic unit in the SQL statement (rather than relying on FILTERING = ON to add these predicates for me).</li>\n<li>For each atomic unit, open a SqlConnection to the Federation Root, execute the USE Federation statement, and then the SQL query, both asynchronously. I use the TPL Dataflow library and async/await to wait for all of the atomic unit queries to conclude, after which I apply (optional, depending on what web request it was) business logic to the results and send back the response.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Each atomic unit in these queries will return between 100-600 records, never more than 2000. The design objective is to query at most 200 atomic units at once => so 400,000 records is the maximum amount that the web server will ever need to apply business logic to, although that logic is never more than \"get one object of each distinct numerical ID in the result,\" for which I have implemented IEqualityComparer.</p>\n\n<p>This approach does not seem to scale <em>that</em> well.

This means that it will be improved all the time and will push the ORM market forward.</li>\n<li>Hibernate is an open source which means you have the code to handle, and in case needed, fit it to your needs.</li>\n<li>There are lots of plugins to Hibernate, such as validations tool, audit tools, etc. These becomes standard as well and dismiss you from impl. things yourself.</li>\n<li>One most important thing with ORM tool, is to configure it according to your applicationâs needs. Usually the default setting doesnât fit to your needs.\nFor that sake, when the market has a huge experience with the toolâs configuration, and lots of experts (see point 1 and 3) â most of chances you will find similar cases and\nlots of knowledge about how to configure the tool and thus â your application.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>EclipseLink:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Fully supported by Oracle.

In reality, the code is so complex that it is nearly impossible to modify it. Moreover as it is LGPL, you need to feedback all the modified sources to the community systematically.</li>\n<li>All tests performed by Oracle concerning Weblogic are using EclipseLink.

You could easily\n// extend it to use an array of scripts or figure it out some other\n// way (see note late)\nfunction lazy_load() {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n            var s = document.createElement(\"script\");\n            s.src=script_url;\n            document.body.appendChild(s);\n        }, 50);\n}\n\nThis is called from onload, and sets a timeout for 50ms later at which point it will \nadd a new script node to the document's body.

It basically comes down to splitting an array of integers in two (almost) equal halves and returning the smallest possible difference between the two. I have included the problem description below. As noted in the comments this can be described as a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12781159/balanced-partition\">balanced partition problem</a>, which is a problem in the realm of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">dynamic programming</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now similar problems have been discussed a lot, but I was unable find an efficient solution for this particular one. The problem is of course that the number of possible combinations to traverse soon grows too large for a brute force search (at least when using recursion). I have a recursive solution that works fine for all but the largest problem sets. I tried to add some optimizations that stop the recursion early, but the performance is still too slow to solve some arrays of the maximum length (30) within the 5 second maximum allowed by CodeFu. Any suggestions for how to improve or rewrite the code would be very welcome. I would also love to know if it might help to make the iterative version.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> on <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/bdean/6.046/dp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this fine site</a> there is a theoretical discussion of the balanced partition problem, which gives a good idea of how to go about and solve this in a dynamic way.

I do not feel either of these points were addressed in the linked question.</p>\n\n<p>I have a somewhat large application designed for enterprise resource management, consisting of many models, views and controllers. I handle all responses from my server by establishing a listener to Ext.Ajax <code>requestComplete</code> and <code>requestException</code> events. I took this approach rather than writing duplicate event handlers on every model's proxy <code>afterRequest</code> event. This enables me to have all of my back-end (using the Zend Framework) controllers responding with three parameters: <code>success</code>, <code>message</code> and <code>data</code>.</p>\n\n<p>After a successful request (i.e., HTTP 200), the method run for <code>requestComplete</code> will inspect the JSON response for the aforementioned parameters. If <code>success</code> is <code>false</code>, it is expected that there will be an error message contained in <code>message</code>, which is then displayed to the user (e.g. 'There was a problem saving that product. Invalid product name'). If success is true, action is taken depending on the type of request, i.e., Create, Read, Update or Destroy. After a successful <code>create</code>, the new record is added to the appropriate data store, after delete the record is destroyed, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>I chose to take this approach rather than adding records to a store and calling the store's <code>sync</code> method in order to minimize XHR's and otherwise round trips. My current means of saving/updating data is to send the request to the backend and react to the result on the Ext front end. I do this by populating a model with data and calling model.save() for create/update requests, or model.destroy() to remove the data.</p>\n\n<p>I found that when adding/updating/removing records from a store, then calling store.sync(), I would have to react to server's response in a way that felt awkward. Take for example, deleting a record:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First, remove the record from the store via <code>store.remove()</code></li>\n<li>Invoke <code>store.sync()</code> as I have store's <code>autoSync</code> set to <code>false</code>.</li>\n<li>This fires the AJAX destroy request from the store's model proxy.</li>\n<li>Here's where it gets weird.... if there is an error on the server while dropping the row from the database, the response will return <code>success: false</code>, however the record will have already been removed from the ExtJS Data Store.</li>\n<li>At this point, I can either call <code>store.sync()</code>, <code>store.load()</code> (both requiring a round trip) or get the record from the request and add it back to the store followed by a <code>commitChanges()</code> to avoid calling an additional sync/load and thus avoiding an unnecessary round trip.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The same goes for adding records, if the server fails somewhere while adding data to the database, the record is still in the ExtJS store and must be removed manually to avoid a round trip with <code>store.sync()</code> or <code>store.load()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid this whole issue, as I previously explained, I instantiate one of my model objects (e.g. a Product model), populate it with data, and call <code>myModel.save()</code>. This, in turn, invokes the proxy's <code>create</code> or <code>update</code> depending on the ID of the model, and fires the appropriate AJAX request. In the event that the back-end fails, the front-end store is still unchanged. On successful requests (read: <code>success: true</code>, not HTTP 200), I manually add the record to the store and invoke <code>store.commitChanges(true)</code>, effectively syncing the store with the database without an additional round trip and avoiding unnecessary overhead. For all requests, the server will respond with the new/modified data as well as a success parameter, and conditionally a message to display on the client.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something here, or is this approach a good way to minimize XHR's and server/client overhead? I am happy to provide example code should that be requested, however I feel that this is a rather general concept with fundamental code. </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","arrays","performance","x86","64bit"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":50,"score":-4,"question_id":13162987,"title":"Most efficient array size in bytes in C# for class references for x86 and x64","body":"<p>I guess what I'm asking is, at what size in bytes does the first non-linear slowdown in accessing such an array come?

The problems is obvious from using the site (sometimes the application doesn't respond for 10-20 seconds), and it's also present in waterfall analysis via webpagetest.org.\nWe're based in Denmark but get this result from any host.</p>\n\n<p>To confirm the problem we've performed a benchmark test where we send 300 identical requests to a simple page and measured the response time.\nIf we send 300 requests to the front page the median response time is below 1 second, which is fairly good.

Since every functionality is mostly independent (they all use the same database, but there is no direct interaction between different functionalities), I'm using the user defined controls and treating them as individual \"applications\". The way the application works is this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The \"root\" application only contains the main menu and 2 panels. The main menu is used to select the group of functionalities.</li>\n<li>After the group is selected (on application startup the first group is automatically selected), the functionalities (represented by buttons) from that group are displayed in the first panel.</li>\n<li><p>The user selects the functionality (by clicking on the appropriate button) he/she wants and the user control that contains the \"form\" is displayed in the second panel.\nThe code that displays all of the user controls looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    panel2.Controls.Clear();\n    UserControl1 uc1 = new UserControl1();\n    uc1.Location = new Point(0, 0);\n    panel2.Controls.Add(uc1);\n    label6.Text = \"User control 1\";\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, when the user selects one of the functionalities, the application clears existing controls, and displays the selected one.\nThe application works fine (the part I implemented so far), so this is my question - how does this approach manage computer resources, mainly the memory. Specifically, if the user uses one functionality, and then switches to another one, will the .NET's services release the memory used by the previous functionality (I think garbage collector is in charge of that) and will the SQL connections, that I use to communicate with the database, be closed?\nAlso, are there some other issues that I should be aware of?\nAs I said, the functionalities work properly, but I'm still very far from full testing of the application as a whole (I only test every functionality individually when I create it, and only on the computer I create it on, so I can't consider it as a proper testing). Because of that, I am worried that the application's performances might deteriorate if the application is constantly used over a longer period of time.\nI'm using VS 2010 (C#) and SQL Server 2005 to create this application.\nIf you have any suggestions, please write them. With this question, I'm trying to prevent major reconstructions of the application once it comes to the phase of testing and implementing due to bad resource management.\nThanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","sql-server","performance","apache","debugging"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":2,"question_id":13135087,"title":"Apache Server and SQL Server 2008 Express Performance.

For example, the realizations of rand. var. A are {1,2,3} and the realizations of B are {5,6,7}. Hence, what I need is the distribution of A+B, i.e. {1+5,1+6,1+7,2+5,2+6,2+7,3+5,3+6,3+7}. And I need to do this kind of adding several times (let's denote this number of additions as COUNT, where COUNT might reach 720) for different random variables (C, D, ...). </p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> if I use this stupid algorithm of summing each realization of A with each realization of B, the complexity is exponential in COUNT. Hence, for the case where each r.v. is given by three values, the amount of calculations for COUNT=720 is 3^720 ~ 3.36xe^343 which will last till the end of our days to calculate:) Not to mention that in real life, the lenght of each r.v. is gonna be 5000+.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solutions:</strong>\n1/ The first solution is to use the fact that I am OK with rounding, i.e. having integer values of realizations. Like this, I can represent each r.v. as a vector and for at the index corresponding to a realization I have a value of 1 (when the r.v. has this realization once). So for a r.v. A and a vector of realizations indexed from 0 to 10, the vector representing A would be [0,1,1,1,0,0,0...] and the representation for B would be [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,10]. Now I create A+B by going through these vectors and do the same thing as above (sum each realization of A with each realization of B and codify it into the same vector structure, quadratic complexity in vector length). The upside of this approach is that the complexity is bound. The problem of this approach is that in real applications, the realizations of A will be in the interval [-50000,50000] with a granularity of 1. Hence, after adding two random variables, the span of A+B gets to -100K, 100K.. and after 720 additions, the span of SUM(A, B, ...) gets to [-36M, 36M] and even quadratic complexity (compared to exponential complexity) on arrays this large will take forever. </p>\n\n<p>2/ To have shorter arrays, one could possibly use a hashmap, which would most likely reduce the number of operations (array accesses) involved in A+B as the assumption is that some non-trivial portion of the theoreical span [-50K, 50K] will never be a realization. However, with continuing summing of more and more random variables, the number of realizations increases exponentially while the span increases only linearly, hence the density of numbers in the span increases over time. And this would kill the hashmap's benefits.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: how can I do this problem efficiently? The solution is needed for calculating a VaR in electricity trading where all distributions are given empirically and are like no ordinary distributions, hence formulas are of no use, we can only simulate.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Using math was considered as the first option as half of our dept. are mathematicians. However, the distributions that we're going to add are badly behaved and the COUNT=720 is an extreme. More likely, we are going to use COUNT=24 for a daily VaR. Taking into account the bad behaviour of distributions to add, for COUNT=24 the central limit theorem would not hold too closely (the distro of SUM(A1, A2, ..., A24) would not be close to normal). As we're calculating possible risks, we'd like to get a number as precise as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The intended use is this: you have hourly casflows from some operation. The distribution of cashflows for one hour is the r.v. A. For the next hour, it's r.v. B, etc. And your question is: what is the largest loss in 99 percent of cases? So you model the cashflows for each of those 24 hours and add these cashflows as random variables so as to get a distribution of the total casfhlow over the whole day. Then you take the 0.01 quantile.</p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","gwt","comparison","smartgwt"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":65,"score":0,"question_id":13133093,"title":"GWT vs SmartGWT","body":"<p>Can you please let me know which of the option( <code>GWT or SmartGWT</code>) is better, considering the below scenario.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Will be used for designing screens and client-side validations.</li>\n<li>Performance ( page loading , grid loading) should be good.</li>\n<li>Need to communicate with server through soap (web services.)</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","performance","optimization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":52,"score":1,"question_id":13134628,"title":"Best settings for mysql full text search","body":"<p>I'm making forum search engine that will crawl forums and help user to find related topics and answers.\nI will use php/mysql for front end.</p>\n\n<p>On each search query it will use mysql full text search across big amount of data (I don't have idea how many records will be there).</p>\n\n<p>Now I have concern about mysql optimization and settings and also about choosing right hardware.\nI don't know much about disk types, etc..</p>\n\n<p>I will start with hetzner server (http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex5).</p>\n\n<p>Can anybody give any tips about this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","performance","google-maps","application","android-mapview"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":0,"question_id":13133011,"title":"Enhance Performance of mapview with 200+ markers","body":"<p>I am having 3 types of overlays on the map. \n1) there is one kind of overlays which is having simple markers.

But <strong>don't confuse the background context for the question I am asking</strong>, which is specifically related to the JavaScript semantics that made object code uncacheable between padge requests. I am not going to give marks for advice on how to make my webapp faster. It's completely tangential to my question, which will probably only be answerable by someone who has worked on a JavaScript compiler or at least the compiler for a dynamic language.</p>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to improve the performance of a web application. Among its many resources, it contains one enormous JavaScript file with 40k lines and 1.3million characters pre-minification. Post-minification it's still large, and it still adds about 100ms to the window.onload event when synchronously loaded, even when the source is cached client-side. (I have conclusively ruled out the possibility that the resource is not being cached by watching the request logs and observing that it is not being requested.)</p>\n\n<p>After confirming that it's still slow after being cached, I started doing some research on JavaScript caching in the major browsers, and have learned that none of them cache object code.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My question is in the form of some hypothetical assertions based on this research. Please object to these assertions if they are wrong.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>JavaScript object code is not cached in any modern browser.</p>\n\n<p>\"Object code\" can mean anything from a byte code representing a simple linearized parse tree all the way to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/v8/design#mach_code\">native machine code</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>JavaScript object code in a web browser is difficult to cache.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, even if you're including a cached JS source file in an external  tag, there is a linear cost to the inclusion of that script on a page, even if the script contains only function definitions, because all of that source needs to be compiled into an object code.</p></li>\n<li><p>JavaScript object code is difficult to cache because JS source must evaluated in order to be compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Statements have the ability to affect the compilation of downstream statements in a dynamic way that is difficult to statically analyze.</p>\n\n<p>3a. (3) is true mostly because of eval().</p></li>\n<li><p>Evaluation can have side effects on the DOM.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Therefore</em>, JavaScript source needs to be compiled on every page request.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus question: do any modern browsers cache a parse tree for cached JS source files? If not, why not?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: If all of these assertions are correct, then I will give the answer to anyone who can <strong>expound on why they are correct,</strong> for example, by providing a sample of JS code that couldn't be cached as object code and then explaining why not.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the suggestions on how to proceed from here to make my app faster, and I mostly agree with them. But the knowledge gap that I'm trying to fill is related to JS object code caching.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","performance","sql-server-2008","ssis"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":497,"score":4,"question_id":9290291,"title":"SQL Script in VM taking long time for execution","body":"<p>I have the Execute SQL Script package that contains the script to insert about 150K records.</p>\n\n<p>Problem in here is when I execute the package in the Virtual machine its taking 25 min's approx and the same package in physical machine its taking 2 min's</p>\n\n<p>Question 1?

The two integers are lookup keys which are used to retrieve one/more objects and all the objects from the two lookups are paired together into new objects.</p>\n\n<p>This small block of code in a much larger more complex system becomes a major performance bottleneck as the dataset it's operating over scales.  Some of this could likely be mitigated by improving the data structures used to store the objects and the lookups involved but the main issue I feel is still the computation of the Cartesian product itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So some more background on my specific usage of the algorithm to see if there may be any tricks that I can use in response to Marc's comment.  The overall system is a SPARQL query engine which processes SPARQL queries over sets of Graph data, SPARQL is a pattern based language so each query consists of a series of patterns which are matched against the Graph(s).  In the case where two subsequent patterns have no common variables (they are disjoint) it is necessary to compute the Cartesian product of the solutions produced by the two patterns to get the set of possible solutions for the overall query.  There may be any number of patterns and I may have to compute Cartesian products multiple times which can lead to a fairly exponential expansion in possible solutions if the query is composed of a series of disjoint patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow from the existing answers I doubt whether there any tricks that could apply</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I thought I would post an update on what I implemented in order to minimise the need to do Cartesian products and thus optimise the query engine generally.  Note that it's not always possible to completely eliminate the need for products but it's nearly always possible to optimise so the size of the two sets being joined is much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>Since each BGP (Basic Graph Pattern) which is a set of Triple Patterns is executed as a block (in essence) the engine is free to reorder patterns within a BGP for optimal performance.  For example consider the following BGP:</p>\n\n<pre><code>?a :someProperty ?b .\n?c :anotherProperty ?d .\n?b a :Class .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Executed as is the query requires a cartesian product since the results of the first pattern are disjoint from the second pattern so the results of the first two patterns is a cartesian product of their individual results.  This result will contain far more results than we actually need since the third pattern restricts the possible results of the first pattern but we don't apply this restriction till afterwards.

As you can see though, some data is missing for some of the people, so I need to ensure those show up as <code>NA</code> and make sure things end up in the right columns. Further, <code>location</code> itself is a vector with two components: <code>state</code> and <code>zip_code</code>, meaning it needs to be flattened to <code>location.state</code> and <code>location.zip_code</code> before it can be merged with another person record; this is what I use <code>unlist()</code> for. I then keep the running master table in <code>people_data</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The above code works, but do you know of a more efficient way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

I have a couple of pre-emptive defenses:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I sometimes suspect that those people who always say, \"Computers are fast; readability <em>always</em> comes before optimization\" are often speaking from experience developing applications where performance, though it may be <em>important</em>, is not <strong>critical</strong>. I'm talking about needing things to happen as close to instantaneously as possible -- like, within nanoseconds (in certain industries, this <em>does</em> matter -- for instance, real-time high-frequency trading).</li>\n<li>Even with that in mind, the alternative approach I describe below is, in fact, quite readable. It is not a bizarre hack, just a simple method that works reliably and fast.</li>\n<li>We <strong>have</strong> runs tests. <code>DateTime.Now</code> <strong>is</strong> slow (relatively speaking). The method below <strong>is</strong> faster.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, onto the question itself.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, from tests, we've found that <code>DateTime.Now</code> takes roughly 25 ticks (around 2.5 microseconds) to run. This is averaged out over thousands to millions of calls, of course. It appears that the first call actually takes a significant amount of time and subsequent calls are much faster. But still, 25 ticks is the average.</p>\n\n<p>However, my colleague and I noticed that <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code> takes substantially less time to run -- on average, a mere 0.03 microseconds.</p>\n\n<p><em>Given that our application will never be running while there is a change in Daylight Savings Time</em>, my suggestion was to create the following class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class FastDateTime {\n    public static TimeSpan LocalUtcOffset { get; private set; }\n\n    public static DateTime Now {\n        get { return DateTime.UtcNow + LocalUtcOffset; }\n    }\n\n    static FastDateTime() {\n        LocalUtcOffset = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In other words, determine the UTC offset for the local timezone <strong>once</strong> -- at startup -- and from that point onward leverage the speed of <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code> to get the current time a lot faster via <code>FastDateTime.Now</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I could see this being a problem if the UTC offset changed during the time the application was running (if, for example, the application was running overnight); but as I stated already, in <em>our</em> case, that will not happen.</p>\n\n<p>My colleague has a different idea about how to do it, which is a bit too involved for me to explain here. Ultimately, <em>as far as I can tell</em>, both of our approaches return an accurate result, mine being slightly faster (~0.07 microseconds vs. ~0.21 microseconds).</p>\n\n<p>What I want to know is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Am I missing something here? Given the abovementioned fact that the application will only run within the time frame of a single date, is <code>FastDateTime.Now</code> safe?</li>\n<li>Can anyone else perhaps think of an even <em>faster</em> way of getting the current time?</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["performance","query","tsql","sql-server-2005"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":74,"score":3,"question_id":12854990,"title":"Why would ISNULL improve the performance of a query?","body":"<p>We're currently trying to speedup some queries and we've run into something which I (not a DBA just a .NET developer) cannot explain or comprehent.

First consider: </p>\n\n<p><code>r\n    outer(X, Y, paste)\n</code></p>\n\n<p>gives me each of the pairs</p>\n\n<pre><code>     [,1]  [,2]  [,3] \n[1,] \"1 2\" \"1 3\" \"1 4\"\n[2,] \"2 2\" \"2 3\" \"2 4\"\n[3,] \"3 2\" \"3 3\" \"3 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Looks good.  But </p>\n\n<pre><code>outer(X, Y, myfunction)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>throws the error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: dims [product 9] do not match the length of object [1]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Meanwhile other possible functions seem to behave as I expected with scalars, such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myfunction &lt;- function(x,y) exp((x-y)^2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which works fine</p>\n\n<pre><code>outer(X, Y, myfunction)\n\n\n         [,1]      [,2]        [,3]\n[1,] 2.718282 54.598150 8103.083928\n[2,] 1.000000  2.718282   54.598150\n[3,] 2.718282  1.000000    2.718282\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In a few quick numerical experiments, it seems this is slightly faster than <code>expand.grid</code>, and the function call more compact, but I don't seem to understand why some functions appear to work as I anticipate and others do not.  </p>\n\n<p>The classic <code>expand.grid</code> solution also requires the function to work with vector arguments, which means a very different thing for my example with <code>min</code>; a different version of the same problem.  Is there a way to enforce the fact that the arguments to my function must be scalars rather than vectors?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","performance","join"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13081434,"title":"Multiple Joins really slow down MySQL query","body":"<p>This is my first time doing such a large query and so many joins.

Is there any way to get this in one sweep without resorting to sub-queries? </p>\n\n<p>I have tested one <em>alternative method</em>, but it still relies on a sub-query and I think this is faster. For that method you create a \"starts and stops\" table with start_timestamp, end_timestamp, system. Then you join to the larger table and if the timestamp is between those, you classify it as being in that state, which is essentially an alternative to <code>cumlative_sum_of_nonrepeats_by_system</code>. But when you do this, you join on 1=1 for thousands of devices and thousands or millions of 'events'.

Consider a bread-first graph algorithm algorithm; the number of synchronizations would be quite large. Waste of time, no?</p>\n\n<p>Trying the same in the old-fashioned threading approach:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var queue = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;Job&gt; { firstJob };\nvar threads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();\nvar waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent(false);\nint numBusy = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; maxThreads; i++) \n  threads.Add(new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate {\n    while (!queue.IsEmpty || numBusy &gt; 0) {\n      if (queue.IsEmpty)\n        // numbusy &gt; 0 implies more data may arrive\n        waitHandle.WaitOne();\n\n      Job job;\n      if (queue.TryDequeue(out job)) {\n        Interlocked.Increment(ref numBusy);\n        WorkJob(job); // WorkJob does a waitHandle.Set() when more work was found\n        Interlocked.Decrement(ref numBusy);\n      }\n    }\n    // others are possibly waiting for us to enable more work which won't happen\n    waitHandle.Set(); \n})));\nthreads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.Start());\nthreads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.Join());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>Parallel.For</code> code is of course much cleaner, but what I cannot comprehend, it's even faster as well!

People said it was because the Simulator or the computer are not optimized to run iOS OpenGL. Then I tested it on a real device, and to my surprise, the performance difference was really small.

I have a 6 GB dataset (text), evenly distributed on the cluster, The dataset has two keys that I then GroupBy into two reducers (I'm using cascading). So each reducer has 3GB of data. I give each reducer 12 GB of memory, but I'm still seeing a 20 minute merge phase.</p>\n\n<p>Two questions: Shouldn't this merge be done entirely in memory (if I have 12 GB of Heap). Even without an in memory merge, 20 minutes seems like way way too long to merge 3GB, especially with 12 disks(JBOD) and 12 cores on a node. I'm wondering if I'm writing the partial merge data to the wrong place (HDFS, vs local?).</p>\n\n<p>the MAPRFS_BYTES_READ, and MAPRFS_BYTES_WRITTEN are interesting. The initial dataset is 6GB (which it shows in the Map column). Somehow sorting increases it to 17GB, which seems odd. Then in the reduce Phase it's reading 23GB from MapRfs, and writing 17GB. Should the reduce phase merge data be written to MapRFS or to the local FS? WHy would the size grow so much over the initial dataset (no compression is used, it's straight text)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>    Counter     Map     Reduce  Total\nJob Counters    Aggregate

You could also just halt it with a \"pause\" button, and you'll see exactly what it's doing. </p>\n\n<p>Even if it's only 10% slower than it should be, if you halt it more times, before long you'll see it repeatedly doing the unnecessary thing. Usually the problem is a function call somewhere in the middle of the stack that isn't really needed. This doesn't measure the problem, but it sure does find it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The objections mostly assume that you only take 1 sample. If you're serious, take 10. Any line of code causing some percentage of wastage, like 40%, will appear on the stack on that fraction of samples, on average. Bottlenecks (in single-thread code) can't hide from it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To show what I mean, many objections are of the form \"there aren't enough samples, so what you see could be entirely spurious\" - vague ideas about chance. But if something of <em>any recognizable description</em>, not just being in a routine or the routine being active, is in effect for 30% of the time, then the probability of seeing it on any given sample is 30%. </p>\n\n<p>Then suppose only 10 samples are taken. The number of times the problem will be seen in 10 samples follows a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">binomial distribution</a>, and the probability of seeing it 0 times is .028. The probability of seeing it 1 time is .121. For 2 times, the probability is .233, and for 3 times it is .267, after which it falls off. Since the probability of seeing it less than two times is .028 + .121 = .139, that means the probability of seeing it two or more times is 1 - .139 = .861. The general rule is if you see something you could fix on two or more samples, it is worth fixing. </p>\n\n<p>In this case, the chance of seeing it in 10 samples is 86%. If you're in the 14% who don't see it, just take more samples until you do. (If the number of samples is increased to 20, the chance of seeing it two or more times increases to more than 99%.) So it hasn't been precisely measured, but it has been precisely found, and it's important to understand that it could easily be something that a profiler could not actually find, such as something involving the state of the data, not the program counter.</p>\n"},{"tags":["networking","network-programming","performance","ping"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2956,"score":1,"question_id":4575537,"title":"Calculate upload/download speed by ping","body":"<p>How to calculate the speed of an internet connection by some average ping rates.What are the calculations involved in it.IS it possible to calculate upload/download limit by ping rate</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nIf ping is not a solution what else is?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","performance","math","matrix","usability"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":88,"score":0,"question_id":13035464,"title":"Fast and useful way of storing matrix values in C#","body":"<p>I need to create a 4x4 matrix class for a 3D engine in C#.\nI have seen some other engines storing the matrix values in single float member variables / fields like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>float m11, m12, m13, m14\nfloat m21, m22, m23, m24\nfloat m31, m32, m33, m34\nfloat m41, m42, m43, m44\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I thought storing them in a two dimensional array would be more useful for transformations / calculations with the matrices:</p>\n\n<pre><code>float[4][4];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also thought of a one dimensional array - but it looks less self explanatory and wouldn't give me an advantage over the first option:</p>\n\n<pre><code>float[16];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In C++, I always used the \"union\" keyword to have all of the above storing possibilites at once.

As we do load test of this endpoint we constantly see heap spikes and ultimately the system crashes. I'm thinking - as we make requests each request is serviced by a thread separately. My hypothesis is: Because the string is saved in a global static variable, each thread takes a copy of the 4MB and after around 3000 requests the heap is all consumed and the system crashes because 3000 threads taking each 4MB is around 12GB and hence the system goes out of memory.

Are there means of making python work at better speed (eg Numpy and Scipy) and will that be equivalent to the effectiveness of c?</p>\n\n<p>Also is there some other open-source framework (maybe based in c or c++?) that you believe will be better for my needs? (I have done a quick overview by searching in the web, but still I am confused). Of course I can just use c or c++, but that seems too complicated. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any insight!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","multithreading","performance","concurrency","parallel-processing"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":0,"question_id":13031886,"title":"Python concurrency performance","body":"<p>I'm facing concurrency in Python for the first time with the goal in mind to optimize my script.

There are no server side scripts or database calls going on. Just HTML, CSS, JS, and images.  I have already done some things like push js to the end of the body tag to get parallel downloads.  I am aware that the main.html and templates.html are adding to the overall wait time by being done synchronously after js.js downloads, that's not the problem.  I am just surprised at how much \"wait\" time there is for each request.  Does server distance affect this?  what about being on a shared server, does that affect the wait time?

Next, the user decides to switch to the real-time stage.

I often need the recipe's items in a specific order, so I added some methods to <code>Recipe</code> - <code>itemsByName</code>, <code>itemsByDate</code>, etc. These use a <code>sortDescriptor</code> to sort everything in the <code>items</code> set and return an <code>NSArray</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Accessing <code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors</code> during runtime was proving to be a noticeable bottleneck in my UI, so I added a caching mechanism. <code>Recipe</code> now has an iVar for each sorted array: <code>_cachedItemsByName</code>, <code>_cachedItemsByDate</code>, etc. If the cache exists (and is not flagged as dirty), the <code>itemsByName</code> method returns the iVar instead of re-sorting the set each time.</p>\n\n<p>This worked fine once my application had been running a while, but still lead to noticeable UI issues each time a recipe's ordered items was requested for the first time (since the cache had to be created using <code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors</code>).

I've read that I can't interact with the NSManagedObjectContext or any of it's objects in a different thread (my processing just involves iterating through each <code>Recipe</code> object and telling it to update it's iVar. This involves sorting through it's <code>items</code> relationship).</li>\n<li>Just make <code>items</code> an ordered relationship so that the order doesn't have to be calculated at run time. But I have multiple orders in which I need to return the items, so I would need multiple relationships to the same objects, just in different orders. This seems icky - I would be responsible for keeping each <code>NSOrderedSet</code> up to date. For example, when an item is added, I would have to insert it multiple times into different relationships. Also, I have read that the NSOrderedSet introduces it's own performance overhead.</li>\n<li>Some other way to persist the cache - I don't really know where to start on this one. Perhaps write each Recipe's cache to file somehow, and then try to match them up at load time? I'm not sure this would be any quicker than re-sorting each recipe on launch, but I would be willing to try it out if someone could suggest how and where to store this.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would love some feedback on each of the options above, and even better, some alternatives.

They are as follow:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tempString = ','.join(str(n) for n in coords)\ntempString = re.sub(',{2,6}', '_', tempString)\ntempString = re.sub(\"[^0-9\\-\\.\\_]\", \",\", tempString)\ntempString = re.sub(',+', ',', tempString)\nclean1 = re.findall(('[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+,[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+,'\n                 '[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+'), tempString)\ntempString = '_'.join(str(n) for n in clean1)\ntempString = re.sub(',', ' ', tempString)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically it's a long string containing commas and about 1-5 million sets of 4 floats/ints (mixture of both possible),:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-5.65500020981,6.88999986649,-0.454999923706,1,,,-5.65500020981,6.95499992371,-0.454999923706,1,,,\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The 4th number in each set I don't need/want, i'm essentially just trying to split the string into a list with 3 floats in each separated by a space.</p>\n\n<p>The above code works flawlessly but as you can imagine is quite time consuming on large strings.</p>\n\n<p>I have done a lot of research on here for a solution but they all seem geared towards words, i.e. swapping out one word for another.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nOk so this is the solution i'm currently using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def getValues(s):\n    output = []\n    while s:\n        # get the three values you want, discard the 3 commas, and the \n        # remainder of the string\n        v1, v2, v3, _, _, _, s = s.split(',', 6)\n        output.append(\"%s %s %s\" % (v1.strip(), v2.strip(), v3.strip()))         \n    return output\ncoords = getValues(tempString)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice to speed this up even farther? After running some tests It still takes much longer than i'm hoping for.</p>\n\n<p>I've been glancing at numPy, but I honestly have absolutely no idea how to the above with it, I understand that after the above has been done and the values are cleaned up i could use them more efficiently with numPy, but not sure how NumPy could apply to the above.</p>\n\n<p>The above to clean through 50k sets takes around 20 minutes, I cant imagine how long it would be on my full string of 1 million sets.

This is a verbose post and I am not allowed to post any of the T-SQL code unfortunately - my employer has expressly forbid that. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I have learned over the years is that there are loads more people out there that know a heck of a lot more than me - so after searching and not finding what you need, just ask someone :)</p>\n\n<p>All tables have primary keys and if there are tables that link to child tables, there are foreign keys in place. The database and report server is SQL 2008 R2. The server runs 128GB RAM and is an 4CPU Quad core hyper threaded beastie.</p>\n\n<p>First, I have a set of tables that contain Locations, Sections and Areas. A Location is linked through a mapping table to a Section - there are multiple locations to a section, sections are linked to Areas through a mapping table and there are multiple sections to an Area. These table are all located in Database \"A\". I have created a view in a separate Database \"B\" that represents the Area - Section - Location linkages in a nice result set that executes quickly. I call this the LocationSectionArea View. </p>\n\n<p>In database \"B\", thousands of users are entering their daily statistics regarding all sorts of categories of their work. There are at present 91 categories. Each category will contain subcategories which vary from about 3 to as many as 25. The number of categories and subcategories can change at any time with more being added or removed through an administration interface. I have created a View that represents these links and returns a result set called the CategorySubCategoryFields view.</p>\n\n<p>The information being collected for each of these categories/Sub category links varies - some require about 8 different fields, while some require 3, and some only 1. These fields are linked to their appropriate sub categories. This is again contained in database \"B\".</p>\n\n<p>I have constructed a view that nicely pulls this data together in this database which ends up with a large matrix of results that presents the data in a way that can be reported on quite easily, and the views execution so far seems to be quite acceptable in speed. I call this the UserStatsView. This is contained in database \"B\".</p>\n\n<p>Now - the users entering the data are assigned to one of the locations mentioned earlier. The results are required to show all Locations within a Section, and all sections within an area, as well as for each location show each of the categories and sub categories for that category. This then needs to be linked to the results from the UserStatsView so you end up with a rather large matrix of these results intermingled with a lot of 0's where there are no results - but they are created for reporting purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The reports have to be allow a user to , for example, select a Section, and then produce a report of all Locations contained within that section, along with a tally of the results entered by users for that location - for each Category-SubCategory combination there is. It must present all locations for the section and all Categories-SubCategories regardless of if there are actual results entered by users or not. So there may be a lot of 0's on some of the reports.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this I created a results view that cross joins the LocationSectionArea  with the CategorySubCategoryFields view. This created the basic matrix that I want. I then left join this matrix to the results of the UserStatsView, joining on the LocationId, CategoryId and SubCategoryId to insert the results for the users for the locations. This is all created in database \"B\".</p>\n\n<p>Now this all works and is \"ok\" provided you supply enough filters in the final where clause to reduce the number of records. As you can imaging - if they try to run a report with a larger results set - it starts to get very slow. (ie, date range covering 6 months for all locations takes longer than 30 seconds)</p>\n\n<p>Part of my problem is I believe that the Location information is linked in from database \"A\" and the view constructed is contained in database \"B\" along with all the views tables and records for all other information required for this report. </p>\n\n<p>Another part is I believe the very large and complex cross join created that is then linked to the view of users results. The cross join is a Cartesian result with no indexes or related data until it is joined with the UserStatsView result set.</p>\n\n<p>And the third problem I believe is the fact that data is being \"created\" to fill in all the blanks in order to produce the results structure that can then be fed into SSRS. I have seen that table spooling and hash joins take up a lot of the execution time, as well as lookups from the database with the locations, sections and Areas. These were all shown through the query execution estimated plan.</p>\n\n<p>What I am asking is if anyone knows if there is a better way of generating this result set given the criteria outlined above. Have I completely missed a really simple and faster way of doing this, which is highly probable :). If someone can suggest what I should research I will happily go off and do it - just not sure what to research at this stage?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n\n<p>Rod.</p>\n\n<p>Update: the following is the table structure that defines the two databases,. Obviously there is more in the real tables, but this is the crux of how they hang together. Please excuse such a large post - I have removed everything except the key fields and some data fields so you can see how the tables are structured. The table names and field names have been changed to generic names with a lot of extra fields removed so I can post the code.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Database A</p>\n\n<pre><code>**Location

How should I debug such cases.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>Perry</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","performance","interpolation"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":12992157,"title":"Fast bilinear interpolation on old iOS devices","body":"<p>I've got the following code to do a biliner interpolation from a matrix of 2D vectors, each cell has x and y values of the vector, and the function receives k and l indices telling the bottom-left nearest position in the matrix</p>\n\n<pre><code>// p[1]                     returns the interpolated values\n// fieldLinePointsVerts     the raw data array of fieldNumHorizontalPoints x fieldNumVerticalPoints\n//                          only fieldNumHorizontalPoints matters to determine the index to access the raw data\n// k and l                  horizontal and vertical indices of the point just bellow p[0] in the raw data\n\nvoid interpolate( vertex2d* p, vertex2d* fieldLinePointsVerts, int fieldNumHorizontalPoints, int k, int l ) {\n\n    int index = (l * fieldNumHorizontalPoints + k) * 2;\n\n    vertex2d p11;\n    p11.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index].x;\n    p11.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index].y;\n\n    vertex2d q11;\n    q11.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].x;\n    q11.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].y;\n\n    index = (l * fieldNumHorizontalPoints + k + 1) * 2;\n\n    vertex2d q21;\n    q21.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].x;\n    q21.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].y;\n\n    index = ( (l + 1) * fieldNumHorizontalPoints + k) * 2;\n\n    vertex2d q12;\n    q12.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].x;\n    q12.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].y;\n\n    index = ( (l + 1) * fieldNumHorizontalPoints + k + 1 ) * 2;\n\n    vertex2d p22;\n    p22.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index].x;\n    p22.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index].y;\n\n    vertex2d q22;\n    q22.x = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].x;\n    q22.y = fieldLinePointsVerts[index+1].y;\n\n    float fx = 1.0 / (p22.x - p11.x);\n    float fx1 = (p22.x - p[0].x) * fx;\n    float fx2 = (p[0].x - p11.x) * fx;\n\n    vertex2d r1;\n    r1.x = fx1 * q11.x + fx2 * q21.x;\n    r1.y = fx1 * q11.y + fx2 * q21.y;\n\n    vertex2d r2;\n    r2.x = fx1 * q12.x + fx2 * q22.x;\n    r2.y = fx1 * q12.y + fx2 * q22.y;\n\n    float fy = 1.0 / (p22.y - p11.y);\n    float fy1 = (p22.y - p[0].y) * fy;\n    float fy2 = (p[0].y - p11.y) * fy; \n\n    p[1].x = fy1 * r1.x + fy2 * r2.x;\n    p[1].y = fy1 * r1.y + fy2 * r2.y;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Currently this code needs to be run every single frame in old iOS devices, say devices with arm6 processors</p>\n\n<p>I've taken the numeric sub-indices from the wikipedia's equations <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation</a></p>\n\n<p>I'd accreciate any comments on optimization for performance, even plain asm code </p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","arrays","performance","stl","vector"],"answer_count":15,"favorite_count":19,"up_vote_count":69,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":6222,"score":66,"question_id":3664272,"title":"std::vector is so much slower than plain arrays?","body":"<p>I've always thought it's the general wisdom that <code>std::vector</code> is \"implemented as an array,\" blah blah blah.

I hope it's not inappropriate to do that (just tell me if it is).</p>\n\n<p>Iâve developed a small scientific program that performs some mathematical computations. Iâve tried to optimize it so that itâs as fast as possible. Now Iâm almost done deploying it for Windows, Mac and Linux users. But I have not been able to test it on many different computers yet.</p>\n\n<p>Hereâs what troubles me: To deploy for Windows, Iâve used a laptop which has both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it (dual boot). I compared the speed of the app running on these two systems, and I was shocked to observe that <strong>itâs at least twice as slow on Windows!</strong> I wouldnât have been surprised if there were a small difference, but how can one account for such a difference?</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few precisions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The computation that I make the program do are just some brutal and stupid mathematical calculations, basically, it computes products and cosines in a loop that is called a billion times. On the other hand, the computation is multi-threaded: I launch something like 6 QThreads.</li>\n<li>The laptop has two cores @1.73Ghz. At first I thought that Windows was probably not using one of the cores, but then I looked at the processor activity, according to the small graphic, both cores are running 100%.</li>\n<li>Then I thought the C++ compiler for Windows didnât the use the optimization options (things like -O1 -O2) that the C++ compiler for Linux automatically did (in release build), but apparently it does.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Iâm bothered that the app is so mush slower (2 to 4 times) on Windows, and itâs really weird. On the other hand I havenât tried on other computers with Windows yet. Still, do you have any idea why the difference?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional info:</strong> some dataâ¦</p>\n\n<p>Even though Windows seems to be using the two cores, Iâm thinking this might have something to do with threads management, hereâs why:</p>\n\n<p>Sample Computation nÂ°1 (this one launches 2 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 7.33s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 3.72s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 1.36s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample Computation nÂ°2 (this one launches 3 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 6.84s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 3.24s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 1.06s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample Computation nÂ°3 (this one launches 6 QThreads):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows: 8.35s</li>\n<li>PC1-linux: 2.62s</li>\n<li>PC2-linux: 0.47s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PC1-windows = my 2 cores laptop (@1.73Ghz) with Windows 7</li>\n<li>PC1-linux = my 2 cores laptop (@1.73Ghz) with Ubuntu 12.04</li>\n<li>PC2-linux = my 8 cores laptop (@2.20Ghz) with Ubuntu 12.04</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Of course, it's not shocking that PC2 is faster. What's incredible to me is the difference between PC1-windows and PC1-linux).</p>\n\n<p>Note: I've also tried running the program on a recent PC (4 or 8 cores @~3Ghz, don't remember exactly) under Mac OS, speed was comparable to PC2-linux (or slightly faster).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I'll answer here a few questions I was asked in the comments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I just installed Qt SDK on Windows, so I guess I have the latest version of everything (including MinGW?). The compiler is MinGW. Qt version is 4.8.1.</p></li>\n<li><p>I use no optimization flags because I noticed that they are automatically used when I build in release mode (with Qt Creator). It seems to me that if I write something like QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -O1, this only has an effect in debug build.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lifetime of threads etc: this is pretty simple. When the user clicks the \"Compute\" button, 2 to 6 threads are launched simultaneously (depending on what he is computing), they are terminated when the computation ends. Nothing too fancy. Every thread just does brutal computations (except one, actually, which makes a (not so) small\"computation every 30ms, basically checking whether the error is small enough).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: latest developments and partial answers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are some new developments that provide answers about all this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I wanted to determine whether the difference in speed really had something to do with threads or not. So I modified the program so that the computation only uses 1 thread, that way we are pretty much comparing the performance on \"pure C++ code\". It turned out that now Windows was only slightly slower than Linux (something like 15%). So I guess that <strong>a small (but not unsignificant) part of the difference is intrinsic to the system, but the largest part is due to threads management</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>As someone (Luca Carlon, thanks for that) suggested in the comments, I tried building the application with the compiler for Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC), instead of MinGW. And suprise, the computation (with all the threads and everything) was now \"only\" 20% to 50% slower than Linux! I think I'm going to go ahead and be content with that. I noticed that weirdly though, the \"pure C++\" computation (with only one thread) was now even slower (than with MinGW), which must account for the overall difference. So as far as I can tell, <strong>MinGW is slightly better than MSVC except that it handles threads like a moron</strong>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, Iâm thinking either thereâs something I can do to make MinGW (ideally Iâd rather use it than MSVC) handle threads better, or it just canât. I would be amazed, how could it not be well known and documented ? Although I guess I should be careful about drawing conclusions too quickly, Iâve only compared things on one computer (for the moment).</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql","ruby-on-rails","performance"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":87,"score":0,"question_id":12944813,"title":"Rails 3 user matching-algorithm to SQL Query (COMPLICATED)","body":"<p>I'm currently working on an app that matches users based on answered questions.\nI realized my algorithm in normal RoR and ActiveRecord queries but it's waaay to slow to use it.

I am trying to speed this up using multithreading, but up to now this only slows things down.</p>\n\n<p>I parse a CSV file (up to 10GB), and some of these records (aprox. 5M out of a 20M+ record CSV) need to be inserted into a MySQL database. To determine which record needs to be inserted we use a Redis server with sets that contain the correct id's / references.</p>\n\n<p>Since we process around 30 of these files at any given time, and there are some dependencies, we store each file on a Resque queue and have multiple servers handling these (prioritized) queues.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Worker\n  def self.perform(file)\n    CsvParser.each(file) do |line|\n      next unless check_line_with_redis(line)\n      a = ObjectA.find_or_initialize_by_reference(line[:reference])\n      a.object_bs.destroy_all\n      a.update_attributes(line)\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works, scales nice horizontally (more CSV files = more servers), but larger CSV files pose a problem. We currently have files that take over 75 hours to parse this way. There are a number of optimizations I thought of already:</p>\n\n<p>One is cutting down on the MySQL queries; we instantiate AR objects while an insert with plain SQL, if we know the objects Id, is much faster. This way we can probably get rid of most of AR and maybe even Rails to remove overhead this way. We can't use a plain MySQL load data since we have to map the CSVs records to other entities that might have different Ids by now (we combine a dozen legacy databases into a new database).</p>\n\n<p>The other is trying to do more in the same time. There is some IO wait time, network wait time for both Redis and MySQL, and even while MRI uses green threads this might allow us to schedule our MySQL queries at the same time as the IO reads etc. But using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Worker\n  def self.perform(file)\n    CsvParser.each(file) do |line|\n      next unless check_line_with_redis(line)\n      create_or_join_thread(line) do |myLine|\n        a = ObjectA.find_or_initialize_by_reference(myLine[:reference])\n        a.object_bs.destroy_all\n        a.update_attributes(myLine)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def self.create_or_join_thread(line)\n      @thread.join if @thread.present?\n      @thread = Thread.new(line) do |myLine|\n        yield myLine\n      end\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This slowly slows down the process. When I <code>ps au</code> it starts off at 100% CPU, but as time progresses it goes down to just 2-3%. At that moment it does not insert new records at all, it just appears to hang.</p>\n\n<p>I have <code>strace</code>d the process, and at first I see MySQL queries pass by, after a while it appears it is not executing my ruby code at all. Could be a deadlock (it hung after parsing the <em>last</em> line of the CSV, but the process kept on running at 5% CPU and did not quit), or something I read here: <a href=\"http://timetobleed.com/ruby-threading-bugfix-small-fix-goes-a-long-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://timetobleed.com/ruby-threading-bugfix-small-fix-goes-a-long-way/</a></p>\n\n<p>I am using Rails 2.3.8, REE, 1.8.7-2010.02 on Ubuntu 10.10.

Through profiling, I've identified a particular function as the culprit in slowing down the execution. This function is called hundreds of thousands of times within a loop. </p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to convert the function to mex (using Matlab Coder) to speed it up. However, common programming sense tells me the interface between Matlab and the mex code would lead to some overhead, which means calling this mex function thousands of times might not be a good idea.

Or does Matlab do some magic when it's the same mex being called repeatedly to remove the overhead? </p>\n\n<p>If there <em>is</em> significant overhead, I'm thinking of restructuring the code so as to add the loop to the function itself and <em>then</em> creating a mex of that.

It reports:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[memdriver] init\n[memdriver] ioremap() took 76268 usec\n[memdriver] memset() took 12622779 usec\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's 12.6 seconds for the memset.

The PCI device will then continually fill this memory with data, and the user-space app will read it out. If <code>ioremap</code> is a bad way to do this (as Ben suggested below), I'm open to other suggestions that'll allow me to get any large chunk of memory that can be directly accessed by both hardware and software.

But what does it exactly mean? Is displaying error message in GUI sufficient reason for bubbling up checked exception? But it would force GUI programmer to remember to catch RuntimeExceptions and their descendants to display potential error info.</p>\n\n<p>Second view presented in this article is that one should evade inventing own exception classes unless I want to implement some customs field/methods in them. \nI generally disagree with this, my practice up today was just the opposite: I wrapped exceptions in my own exception structure to reflex goals realized by classes I write, even if they just extend Exception without adding any new methods. I think it helps to handle them more flexibly in the higher layers when thrown plus it's generally more clear and comprehensible for programmer who will use these classes.</p>\n\n<p>I implemented some code today 'new way' presented in the article throwing RuntimeException here and there, then I let <a href=\"http://www.sonarsource.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonar</a> analyze it. To confuse me even more Sonar marked my RuntimeExceptions as Major errors with a message like <em>\"Avoid throwing root type exceptions, wrap'em in your own types\".</em></p>\n\n<p>So it looks quite controversional, what do you think?</p>\n\n<p>I also heard from one of tech-leads today that just wrapping exceptions is bad, 'because it's a really costly operation for JVM'.

It was however a graphic example of how much faster compiled code can be vs. a scripting language.</p>\n\n<p>Short version...</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason to prefer a <code>while (1)</code> over a <code>for (;;)</code> if you need an infinite loop to break out of?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If it's not clear from the question.

I check app counters and it can go up to 100% cpu and memory can go over 3GB. Then I will inevitably get the modal that JQuery is taking too long to execute, asking me if I want to stop executing the script.

So they might go to the \"brand\" filter, and choose any of the other listed brands. Lets say they have 2 different options (in practice, this will probably have many more), resulting in the following searches:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Shoe + Black + Nike &gt; 103 results\nShoe + Black + K-swiss &gt; 0 results\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, if they see the brand \"K-swiss\" listed as an available choise in their filter, their search will return 0 results.</p>\n\n<p>This is obviously rather disappointing to the user...

The amount of intersections would be limited by the fact that a <code>tag_type</code> can have only one particular value, but I'm not sure how to efficiently manage this type of caching.

and insert less data, I allow each test class to pick a DataSet enum that only loads the data it needs. It's specified like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public enum DataSet {\n    NONE(create()),\n    CORE(create(\"core.xml\")),\n    USERS(combine(create(\"users.xml\"), CORE)),\n    TAGS(combine(create(\"tags.xml\"), USERS)),\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Could this be causing it to run slower rather than faster? The idea is that if I only want the core xml (languages, provinces, etc.), I only have to load those records. I thought this would make the test suite faster, but it's still too slow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I can save some time by creating a separate xml dataset specifically designed for each test class. This chops out some of the insert statements. But even when I have 20 insert statements in a single xml dataset (thus, the minimum I/O loss other than in-lining the dataset right into java code directly), each test still takes .1 to .15 seconds during the initialization of the database data!</strong> I am in disbelief that it takes .15 seconds to insert 20 records into memory.</p>\n\n<p>In my other project using Spring 3.0 and Hibernate 3.x, it takes 30 milliseconds to insert everything before each test, but it's actually inserting 100 or more rows per test. For the tests that only have 20 inserts, they are flying as if there was no delay at all. This is what I expected. I'm starting to think the problem is with Spring's annotations - or the way I have them setup in my <code>DatabaseTest</code> class. This is basically the only thing different now.</p>\n\n<p>Also, my repositories are using the sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() instead of the HibernateTemplate. This is the first time I started using the annotation-based unit test stuff from Spring, since the Spring test classes are deprecated. Could that be the reason they are going slow?</p>\n\n<p>If there's anything else you need to know to help figure it out, please let me know. I am sort of stumped.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I put in the answer. The problem was hsqldb 2.2.x.

Of course the query running on server A is faster than server B, but what is strange is the query on server B is extreme slow, it takes more than 3 hours where in server A it just takes 10 minutes. </p>\n    I use some tool to monitor system status and find that when the query is running in server A, system IO read speed is about 20~30M/s, but in server B it's 2~3M/s. I've tried to clean linux cache  and restart mysql server, all is the same result. And  I tried to restored DB from server B to server A, so the query in Server A is very very slow and io read speed is very slow. I want to know why this happen? </p>\n    the ap_statistic table data in server A is generated by normally running and table data in server B is generated by a stored procedure. the table scheme is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `ap_statistic` (\n  `ap_statisticId` BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,\n  `deviceId` INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',\n  `macaddress` VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,\n

of VIEW's with WHERE","body":"<p>I'm trying to find out more about MySQL VIEW's, and I'm still quite confused (especially, about the details)</p>\n\n<p>If I get it right, a view is nothng more than a stored SELECT query that gets used. But my problem starts, when I want to use certain values for the WHERE clause inside of the VIEW.</p>\n\n<p>Lets suppose, we have this VIEW:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT `user`.`id`, `userrole`.`key` AS `role`, `userstatus`.`key` AS `status`\nFROM `user`\nLEFT JOIN `userrole`\nON `userrole`.`id` = `user`.`userrole_id`\nLEFT JOIN `userstatus`\nON `userstatus`.`id` = `user`.`userstatus_id`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this would deliver a List of ALL users, with their current role / status</p>\n\n<pre><code>+----+-------+--------+\n| id |  role | status |\n+----+-------+--------+\n|  1 | admin | active |\n|  2 |  user | active |\n|  3 |  user | active |\n|  4 | admin | active |\n| .. |   ... |    ... |\n+----+-------+--------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I just want to know the role / status of the user with the <code>ID</code> 3 - so I would have to do an additional <code>SELECT</code> on the <code>VIEW</code>, with <code>WHERE id = 3</code>, right? But if I do that, what will happen exactly?</p>\n\n<p>Will the <code>VIEW</code> still <code>SELECT</code> all the users, and then the whole data will be dropped, and only the <code>id = 3</code> will be displayed? Or will it be optimized so that the <code>VIEW</code> only selects <code>user.id = 3</code> ?</p>\n\n<p>I'm confused about the performance aspect of this - since if I would have 1 million users, using a <code>VIEW</code> for this would be a rather bad idea. But on the other hand, I would save myself to use the whole <code>SELECT</code> with all the <code>JOIN</code>'s every time, if I have the <code>VIEW</code> for this.</p>\n\n<p>So how exactly does the <code>VIEW</code> act? As simple SUBQUERY, or is it more optimized if you add a <code>WHERE</code> when selecting a <code>VIEW</code>?</p>\n\n<p>I guess if it acts like a SUBQUERY, a <code>STORED PROCEDURE</code> with parameters will always be better than a <code>VIEW</code>, then (if you have <code>WHERE</code> parameters that vary)?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the informations</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","performance","upload","emulator","apk"],"answer_count":12,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":13,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2701,"score":13,"question_id":7597309,"title":"Slow uploads to running Android emulator","body":"<p>I have searched but not found any queries or answers for my specific circumstance.

Specifically, it takes ~25 seconds to write and read 10MB worth of data. I tried this on an embedded system and a Linux VM running on a reasonable PC with similar results. </p>\n\n<p>I am using a EZ-USB FX2 development kit from Cypress as the target board. It is running the bulkloop firmware which sets up two in and two out endpoints. Each endpoint is double buffered and supports 512 byte windows. The firmware polls out endpoints via a while(1) loop in main(), no sleep, and copies data from out to in endpoints when those data are available using autopointers. I have been told that this can move data fairly on Windows using their specific application but have not had a chance to verify this. </p>\n\n<p>My code (relevant portions below) calls a function called bulk_io in the device probe routine. This function creates a number (URB_SETS) of out urbs which attempt to write 512 bytes to the device. Changing this number between 1 and 32 doesn't change performance. They are all copying from the same buffer. The callback handler for each write operation to an out endpoint is used to create a read urb on the corresponding in endpoint. The read callback creates another write urb until I have hit the total number of write/read requests that I want to run at a time (20,000). I am working now to push most of the operations in the callback functions into bottom halves in case they are blocking other interrupts. I am also thinking of rewriting the bulk-loop firmware for the Cypress FX2 to use interrupts instead of polling. Is there anything here that looks out of the ordinary to make the performance so low?

Even if I do an explain() on the query it tells me that it's fast:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"cursor\" : \"BtreeCursor episodes.airdate_1\",\n    \"isMultiKey\" : true,\n    \"n\" : 382,\n    \"nscannedObjects\" : 1620,\n    \"nscanned\" : 1620,\n    \"nscannedObjectsAllPlans\" : 1620,\n    \"nscannedAllPlans\" : 1620,\n    \"scanAndOrder\" : false,\n    \"indexOnly\" : false,\n    \"nYields\" : 0,\n    \"nChunkSkips\" : 0,\n    **\"millis\" : 181**,\n    \"indexBounds\" : {\n        \"episodes.airdate\" : [\n            [\n                ISODate(\"2012-09-07T00:00:00Z\"),\n                ISODate(\"292278995-01--2147483647T07:12:56.808Z\")\n            ]\n        ]\n    },\n    \"server\" : \"example:27017\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But when I use the query inside php and lithium, man, it take ages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$series = Series::find('all', array(\n                'fields' =&gt; array('title', 'episodes.title', 'episodes.airdate'),\n                'conditions' =&gt; array('episodes.airdate' =&gt; array('$gt' =&gt; new MongoDate(strtotime(date('Y-m-01'))), '$lt' =&gt;  new MongoDate(strtotime(date('Y-m-t')))))\n            ));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And if I even try to loop through it, then it's even worse <strong>well past</strong> the 30 second execution time. All though, I think I have a memory leak since I had to add this <code>ini_set('memory_limit', '-1');</code> without getting a \"maxium usage\" or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>Could anyone provide me with a answer on why this is happening? Is there any way to improve the speed of the query? I have no idea why it is so slow and I would be super glad if anyone could point me in the right direction.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","performance","event-handling","windows-mobile"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":1,"question_id":12749758,"title":"Slow Response After Clicking Button in VB.NET","body":"<p>I have created a windows form on a Windows Mobile 6.5 application.

I want to render <strong>a single component</strong> based on runtime information about a business class (much like an if-then-else), but I can only determine what is the component to render at runtime.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>\nwhat happens is that each component referenced by <code>limites:limites*</code> is a huge complex page with lots of other components. At runtime, the parameter named <code>type' will decide what component to render. But my tests show that if I only render one component, but leave the other</code>ui:fragments` (even knowing that they will not be rendered), it will render <em>much</em> slower than if I remove the components.</p>\n\n<p>So if my page is exactly like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;composite:interface&gt;\n    &lt;composite:attribute name=\"type\" required=\"true\" /&gt;\n    &lt;composite:attribute name=\"limite\" required=\"true\" /&gt;\n&lt;/composite:interface&gt;         \n&lt;composite:implementation&gt; \n    &lt;ui:fragment rendered=\"#{cc.attrs.type eq 'cartcred'}\"&gt;\n        &lt;limites:limites-cartcred  limite=\"#{cc.attrs.limite}\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/ui:fragment&gt;\n&lt;/composite:implementation&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it will render <em>much</em> (around 10x) faster than the initial version, even though the parameters are the same. I suspect that JSF will create the entire component tree and only at runtime it will decide (depending on the supplied parameter) if it will render each other or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Almost there.

I've gotten through basic obstacles: I have a robust UDP messaging system, relatively clean program design, I've got a mirror driver (the free DFMirage mirror driver from DemoForge) up and running, and I've implemented NAT traversal for all NAT types except Symmetric NATs (present in corporate firewall situations).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding screen transfer/sharing, thanks to the mirror driver, I'm automatically notified of changed screen regions and I can simply marshal the mirror driver's ever-changing screen bitmap to my own bitmap. Then I compress the screen region as a PNG and send it off from the server to my client. Things are looking pretty good, but it's not fast enough. It's just as slow as VNC (btw, I don't use the VNC protocol, just a custom amateur protocol).</p>\n\n<p>From the slowest remote desktop software to the fastest, the list usually begins at all VNC-like implementations, then climbs up to Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop...and then...TeamViewer. Not quite sure about CrossLoop, LogMeIn - I haven't used them, but TeamViewer is <em>insanely</em> fast. It's quite literally live. I ran a <code>tree</code> command on Command Prompt and it updated with 20 ms delay. I can browse the web just a few milliseconds slower than on my laptop. Scrolling code vertically in Visual Studio has 50 ms lag time. Think about how robust TeamViewer's screen-transfer solution must be to accomplish all this.</p>\n\n<p>VNCs use poll-based hooks for detecting screen change and brute force screen capturing/comparing at their worst. At their best, they use a mirror driver like DFMirage. I'm at this level. And they use something called the RFB protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop apparently goes one step higher than VNC. I heard, from somewhere on StackOverflow, that Windows Remote Desktop doesn't send screen bitmaps, but actual drawing commands. That's quite brilliant, because it can just send simple text (draw this rectangle at this coordinate and color it with this gradient)! Remote Desktop really is pretty fast - and it's the standard way of working from home. And it uses something called the RDP protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Now TeamViewer is a complete mystery to me. Apparently, they released their source code for Version 2 (TeamViewer is Version 7 as of February 2012). People have read it and said that Version 2 is useless - that it's just a few improvements over VNC with automatic NAT traversal. </p>\n\n<p>But Version 7...it's ridiculously fast now. I mean, it's actually faster than Windows Remote Desktop. I've streamed DirectX 3D games with TeamViewer (at 1 fps, but Windows Remote Desktop doesn't even allow DirectX to run).</p>\n\n<p>By the way, TeamViewer does all this <em>without</em> a mirror driver. There is an option to install one, and it gets just a bit faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is, how is TeamViewer so fast?</strong> It must not be possible. If you've got 1920 by 1080 resolution at even 24 bit depth (16 bit depth would be noticeably ugly), thats still 6,220,800 bytes raw. Even using libjpeg-turbo (one of the fastest JPG compression libraries used by large corporations), compressing it down to 30KB (let's be extremely generous), would take time to route through TeamViewer's servers (TeamViewer bypasses corporate Symmetric NATs by simply proxying traffic through their servers). And that libjpeg-turbo compression would take time to compress. High-quality JPG compression takes 175 milliseconds for a full 1920 by 1080 screenshot for me. And that number goes up if the host's computer runs an Atom processor. I simply don't understand how TeamViewer has optimized their screen transfer so well. Again, small-size images might be highly compressed, but take at least tens of milliseconds to compress. Large-size images take no time to compress, but take a long time to get through. Somehow, TeamViewer completes this entire process to get roughly 20-25 frames per second. I've used a network monitor, and TeamViewer is still lagless at speeds of 500 Kbps and 1 Mbps (VNC software lag for a few seconds at that transfer rate). During my <code>tree</code> Command Prompt test, TeamViewer was receiving inbound data at a rate of 1 Mbps and still running 5-6 fps. VNC and remote desktop don't do that. So, how?</p>\n\n<p>The answers will be somewhat complicated and intricate, so <em>please don't post your $0.02 if you're only going to say it's because they use UDP instead of TCP</em> (would you believe they actually do use TCP just as successfully though).</p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping there's a TeamViewer developer somewhere here on StackOverflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential Answers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Will update this once people reply.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My thoughts are, first of all, that TeamViewer has very fine network control.

I also tried <a href=\"http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/8/\">Carmack's wacky Newton-Rhapson approximation technique</a>, which ran even better than the hardware, at 4.3ns/float, although with an error of 1 in 2<sup>10</sup> (which is too much for my purposes). </p>\n\n<p>The doozy was when I tried the SSE op for <em>reciprocal</em> square root, and then used a multiply to get the square root ( x * 1/&radic;x = &radic;x ).

After experimenting \non my own for a while (using ExecutorService and CyclicBarrier) and\nbeing somewhat surprised by the results, I would be grateful for some \nexpert advice and maybe some new ideas. Existing questions here do \nnot seem to focus primarily on performance, hence this new one. \nThanks in advance! </p>\n\n<p>The core of the app is a simple iterative data processing algorithm,\nparallelized to the spread the computational load across 8 cores on\na Mac Pro, running OS X 10.6 and Java 1.6.0_07. The data to be processed\nis split into 8 blocks and each block is fed to a Runnable to be executed \nby one of a fixed number of threads. Parallelizing the algorithm was\nfairly straightforward, and it functionally works as desired, but\nits performance is not yet what I think it could be. The app seems\nto spend a lot of time in system calls synchronizing, so after some\nprofiling I wonder whether I selected the most appropriate\nsynchronization mechanism(s).</p>\n\n<p>A key requirement of the algorithm is that it needs to proceed in \nstages, so the threads need to sync up at the end of each stage. \nThe main thread prepares the work (very low overhead), passes it to \nthe threads, lets them work on it, then proceeds when all threads \nare done, rearranges the work (again very low overhead) and repeats \nthe cycle. The machine is dedicated to this task, Garbage Collection\nis minimized by using per-thread pools of pre-allocated items, and\nthe number of threads can be fixed (no incoming requests or the like,\njust one thread per CPU core).</p>\n\n<h2>V1 - ExecutorService</h2>\n\n<p>My first implementation used an ExecutorService with 8 worker\nthreads. The program creates 8 tasks holding the work and then\nlets them work on it, roughly like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// create one thread per CPU\nexecutorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool( 8 );\n...\n// now process data in cycles\nwhile( ...) {\n    // package data into 8 work items\n    ...\n\n    // create one Callable task per work item\n    ...\n\n    // submit the Callables to the worker threads\n    executorService.invokeAll( taskList );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works well functionally (it does what it should), and for\nvery large work items indeed all 8 CPUs become highly loaded, as\nmuch as the processing algorithm would be expected to allow (some\nwork items will finish faster than others, then idle). However,\nas the work items become smaller (and this is not really under\nthe program's control), the user CPU load shrinks dramatically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>blocksize | system | user | cycles/sec\n256k        1.8%    85%     1.30\n64k         2.5%    77%     5.6\n16k         4%      64%     22.5\n4096        8%      56%     86\n1024       13%      38%     227\n256        17%      19%     420\n64         19%      17%     948\n16         19%      13%     1626\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Legend:\n - block size = size of the work item (= computational steps)\n - system = system load, as shown in OS X Activity Monitor (red bar)\n - user = user load, as shown in OS X Activity Monitor (green bar)\n - cycles/sec = iterations through the main while loop, more is better</p>\n\n<p>The primary area of concern here is the high percentage of time spent\nin the system, which appears to be driven by thread synchronization\ncalls. As expected, for smaller work items, ExecutorService.invokeAll()\nwill require relatively more effort to sync up the threads\nversus the amount of work being performed in each thread. But\nsince ExecutorService is more generic than it would need to be\nfor this use case (it can queue tasks for threads if there are\nmore tasks than cores), I though maybe there would be a leaner\nsynchronization construct.</p>\n\n<h2>V2 - CyclicBarrier</h2>\n\n<p>The next implementation used a CyclicBarrier to sync up\nthe threads before receiving work and after completing it,\nroughly as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>main() {\n    // create the barrier\n    barrier = new CyclicBarrier( 8 + 1 );\n\n    // create Runable for thread, tell it about the barrier\n    Runnable task = new WorkerThreadRunnable( barrier );\n\n    // start the threads\n    for( int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++ )\n    {\n        // create one thread per core\n        new Thread( task ).start();\n    }\n\n    while( ... ) {\n        // tell threads about the work\n        ...\n\n        // N threads + this will call await(), then system proceeds\n        barrier.await();\n\n        // ... now worker threads work on the work...\n\n        // wait for worker threads to finish\n        barrier.await();\n    }\n}\n\nclass WorkerThreadRunnable implements Runnable {\n    CyclicBarrier barrier;\n\n    WorkerThreadRunnable( CyclicBarrier barrier ) { this.barrier = barrier; }\n\n    public void run()\n    {\n        while( true )\n        {\n            // wait for work\n            barrier.await();\n\n            // do the work\n            ...\n\n            // wait for everyone else to finish\n            barrier.await();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this works well functionally (it does what it should),\nand for very large work items indeed all 8 CPUs become highly\nloaded, as before.

This is video security software that can display up to 48 cameras at once. Each video stream gets its own Windows HDC but they all use a shared OpenGL context. I get pretty good performance with OpenGL and it runs on Windows/Linux/Mac. Under the hood the contexts are created using wxWidgets 2.8 wxGLCanvas, but I don't think that has anything to do with the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's the issue. Say I take the same camera and display it in all 48 of my windows. This basically means I'm only decoding 30fps (which is done on a different thread anywa) but displaying up to 1440fps to take decoding out of the picture. I'm using PBOs to transfer the images over, depending on whether pixel shaders and multitexturing are supported I may use those to do YUV->RGB conversion on the GPU. Then I use a quad to position the texture and call SwapBuffers. All the OpenGL calls come from the UI thread. Also I've tried doing YUV->RGB conversion on the CPU and messed with using GL_RGBA and GL_BGRA textures, but all formats still yield roughly the same performance. Now the problem is I'm only getting around 1000fps out of the possible 1440fps (I know I shouldn't be measuring in fps, but its easier in this scenario). The above scenario is using 320x240 (YUV420) video which is roughly only 110MB/sec. If I use a 1280x720 camera then I get roughly the same framerate which is nearly 1.3GB/sec. This tells me that it certainly isn't the texture upload speed. If I do the YUV->RGB conversion and scaling on the CPU and paint using a Windows DC then I can easily get the full 1440fps.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing to mention is that I've disabled vsync both on my video card and through OpenGL using wglSwapIntervalEXT. Also there are no OpenGL errors being reported. However, using very sleepy to profile the application it seems to be spending most of its time in SwapBuffers. I'm assuming the issue is somehow related to my use of multiple HDCs or with SwapBuffers somewhere, however, I'm not sure how else to do what I'm doing.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on OpenGL so if anyone has any suggestions or anything I would love to hear them. If there is anything that I'm doing that sounds wrong or any way I could achieve the same thing more efficiently I'd love to hear it.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some links to glIntercept logs for a better understanding of all the OpenGL calls being made:</p>\n\n<p>Simple RGB: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzGMib6CGH4TdUdlcTBYMHNTRnM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzGMib6CGH4TdUdlcTBYMHNTRnM</a></p>\n\n<p>Shaders YUV: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzGMib6CGH4TSDJTZGxDanBwS2M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzGMib6CGH4TSDJTZGxDanBwS2M</a></p>\n\n<p>Profiling Information:\nSo after profiling it reported several redundant state changes which I'm not surprised by. I eliminated all of them and saw no noticeable performance difference which I kind of expected. I have 34 state changes per render loop and I am using several deprecated functions. I'll look into using vertex arrays which would solve these. However, I'm just doing one quad per render loop so I don't really expect much performance impact from this. Also keep in mind I don't want to rip everything out and go all VBOs because I still need to support some fairly old Intel chipset drivers that I believe are only OpenGL 1.4.</p>\n\n<p>The thing that really interested me and it hadn't occurred to me before was that each context has its own front and back buffer. Since I'm only using one context the previous HDCs render call must finish writing to the back buffer before the swap can occur and then the next one can start writing to the back buffer again. Would it really be more efficient to use more than one context? Or should I look into rendering to textures (FBOs I think) instead and continue using one context?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The original description mentioned using multiple OpenGL contexts, but I was wrong I'm only using one OpenGL context and multiple HDCs.\nEDIT2: Added some information after profiling with gDEBugger.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","performance","sql-server-2008-r2","database-performance"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":76,"score":3,"question_id":12723252,"title":"Is there a negative impact to using SQL Server with a lower compatibility level","body":"<p>We have SQL Server 2008 R2 which we are using for a database with a compatibility level set as 2005 (90).</p>\n\n<p>We will by upgrading it to 2008 at some point, but in the meantime I would like to know if having the database in a lower compatibility level is this going to have a negative effect on its performance?</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/178509/95399\">this question</a> that implies there could be a negative effect, but it's for an older version of SQL Server.</p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","sorting","timsort"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":13,"score":0,"question_id":12728406,"title":"Can anyone please explain the pseudocode of TimSort?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1733073/grokking-timsort\">Grokking Timsort</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not able top understand why TimSort performs better?

Thanks everyone for your suggestions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Question:</strong> What is the most efficient method of building a fixed interval dataset from a random interval dataset using stale data?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some background:</strong> The above is a common problem in statistics. Frequently, one has a sequence of observations occurring at random times. Call it <code>Input</code>. But one wants a sequence of observations occurring say, every 5 minutes. Call it <code>Output</code>. One of the most common methods to build this dataset is using stale data, ie set each observation in <code>Output</code> equal to the most recently occurring observation in <code>Input</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So, here is some code to build example datasets:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TInput = 100;\nTOutput = 50;\n\nInputTimeStamp = 730486 + cumsum(0.001 * rand(TInput, 1));\nInput = [InputTimeStamp, randn(TInput, 1)];\n\nOutputTimeStamp = 730486.002 + (0:0.001:TOutput * 0.001 - 0.001)';\nOutput = [OutputTimeStamp, NaN(TOutput, 1)];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both datasets start at close to midnight at the turn of the millenium. However, the timestamps in <code>Input</code> occur at random intervals while the timestamps in <code>Output</code> occur at fixed intervals. For simplicity, I have ensured that the first observation in <code>Input</code> always occurs before the first observation in <code>Output</code>. Feel free to make this assumption in any answers.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I solve the problem like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sMax = size(Output, 1);\ntMax = size(Input, 1);\ns = 1;\nt = 2;\n%#Loop over input data\nwhile t &lt;= tMax\n    if Input(t, 1) &gt; Output(s, 1)\n        %#If current obs in Input occurs after current obs in output then set current obs in output equal to previous obs in input\n        Output(s, 2:end) = Input(t-1, 2:end);\n        s = s + 1;\n        %#Check if we've filled out all observations in output\n        if s &gt; sMax\n            break\n        end\n        %#This step is necessary in case we need to use the same input observation twice in a row\n        t = t - 1;\n    end\n    t = t + 1;\n    if t &gt; tMax\n        %#If all remaining observations in output occur after last observation in input, then use last obs in input for all remaining obs in output \n        Output(s:end, 2:end) = Input(end, 2:end);\n        break\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Surely there is a more efficient, or at least, more elegant way to solve this problem? As I mentioned, this is a common problem in statistics. Perhaps Matlab has some in-built function I'm not aware of? Any help would be much appreciated as I use this routine a LOT for some large datasets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE ANSWERS:</strong> Hi all, I've analyzed the three answers, and as they stand, Angainor's is the best. </p>\n\n<p>ChthonicDaemon's answer, while clearly the easiest to implement, is really slow. This is true even when the conversion to a <code>timeseries</code> object is done outside of the speed test. I'm guessing the <code>resample</code> function has a lot of overhead at the moment. I am running 2011b, so it is possible Mathworks have improved it in the intervening time. Also, this method needs an additional line for the case where <code>Output</code> ends more than one observation after <code>Input</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Rody's answer runs only slightly slower than Angainor's (unsurprising given they both employ the <code>histc</code> approach), however, it seems to have some problems. First, the method of assigning the last observation in <code>Output</code> is not robust to the last observation in <code>Input</code> occurring after the last observation in <code>Output</code>. This is an easy fix. But there is a second problem which I think stems from having <code>InputTimeStamp</code> as the first input to <code>histc</code> instead of the <code>OutputTimeStamp</code> adopted by Angainor. The problem emerges if you change <code>OutputTimeStamp = 730486.002 + (0:0.001:TOutput * 0.001 - 0.001)';</code> to <code>OutputTimeStamp = 730486.002 + (0:0.0001:TOutput * 0.0001 - 0.0001)';</code> when setting up the example inputs.</p>\n\n<p>Angainor's appears robust to everything I threw at it, plus it was the fastest.</p>\n\n<p>I did a lot of speed tests for different input specifications - the following numbers are fairly representative:</p>\n\n<p>My naive loop: <code>Elapsed time is 8.579535 seconds.</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Angainor</strong>: <code>Elapsed time is 0.661756 seconds.</code></p>\n\n<p>Rody: <code>Elapsed time is 0.913304 seconds.</code></p>\n\n<p>ChthonicDaemon: <code>Elapsed time is 22.916844 seconds.</code></p>\n\n<p>I'm +1-ing Angainor's solution and marking the question solved.

I'd appreciate any insight on the matter.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: As per Iridium answer, I performed the test in a loop (putting the whole logic including the container creation into the the loop so as to exclude any compiler optimization tricks), discarded the first two results and averaged subsequent 1000 results. Here they are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Adding values for generic list: 1.09 ticks\nSorting for generic list: 14.07 ticks\nAdding values for C5 ArrayList: 1.92 ticks\nSorting for C5 ArrayList: 13.69 ticks\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now C5 insertion is 76% slower and sorting is on par with that of List. That's good enough for my purpose. I'm accepting Iridium's answer. Still, if anyone has any insight on the slower insertion, please share it.

How can inlining be predicted for performance?","body":"<p>My question concerns modern browser optimization through function inlining. I think I really need someone who is familiar with the V8, JavaScriptCore, and/or SpiderMonkey codebase to answer this question; or at least someone knowledgeable in modern browser approaches to optimization.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I want to know if there's any way to predict when function inlining will be used and how to leverage it for optimizing performance with minimal code duplication.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take the following simple function from <a href=\"http://joijs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">joi</a> tempo as an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function limit(f, max) {\n    var count = 0, isFunction = typeof max == 'function';\n    if(!isFunction) max = max &gt;&gt;&gt; 0 || 1;\n    return function limitedFunction() {\n        if(isFunction ? !max(count) : (count &gt;= max)) return;\n        count++;\n        return f.apply(this, arguments);\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This function takes a function <code>f</code> and returns a wrapper function which limits the number of times the original function can be called through the wrapper. Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = limit(function() { console.log('foo'); }, 3);\nfoo(); // logs 'foo'\nfoo(); // logs 'foo'\nfoo(); // logs 'foo'\nfoo(); // doesn't log anything\nfoo(); // doesn't log anything\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also accepts a function which returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> as its second argument (instead of a number):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var bar = limit(\n    function() { console.log('bar'); },\n    function() { return Math.random() &gt; 0.5 ? true : false }\n);\nbar(); // randomly logs 'bar' or doesn't log anything\nbar(); // randomly logs 'bar' or doesn't log anything\nbar(); // randomly logs 'bar' or doesn't log anything\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is an overly simplistic, trivial example, so bear with me. I think there are real applications for this in non-trivial cases, but I want to use an easy case to get to the root of how the browser does or can do inlining.</p>\n\n<p>One way to rewrite this function which could (probably) be (very slightly) improved for performance (I imagine) would be to separate the returned <code>function</code> into two cases, one where <code>max</code> is a function and the other where <code>max</code> is a number:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function limit(f, max) {\n    var count = 0, isFunction = typeof max == 'function';\n    if(!isFunction) max = max &gt;&gt;&gt; 0 || 1;\n    return isFunction\n        ? function limitedFunctionA() {\n            if(!max(count)) return;\n            count++;\n            return f.apply(this, arguments);\n        }\n        : function limitedFunctionB() {\n            if(count &gt;= max) return;\n            count++;\n            return f.apply(this, arguments);\n        };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way the check to see if <code>isFunction</code> is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> doesn't have to occur <em>every time</em> <code>limitedFunction</code> is called but only once when it is determined whether to return <code>limitedFunctionA</code> or <code>limitedFunctionB</code>.  However, this is not ideal because there is some redundant code.</p>\n\n<p>My question concerns the following rewrite:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function limit(f, max) {\n    var count = 0, isFunction = typeof max == 'function',\n        check = isFunction\n            ? function() { return !max(count); }\n            : function() { return count &gt;= max; };\n    if(!isFunction) max = max &gt;&gt;&gt; 0 || 1;\n    return function limitedFunction() {\n        if(check()) return;\n        count++;\n        return f.apply(this, arguments);\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So here's my question... <strong>Will modern browsers be smart enough to turn</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>if(check()) return;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>into</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>if(!max(count)) return;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>when <code>isFunction</code> is true, and</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>if(count &gt;= max) return;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>when <code>isFunction</code> is false?</strong> ... preventing the need to call the extra <code>check()</code> function, throwing an extra function onto the stack unnecessarily each time.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","performance","loops","sum","intel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":83,"score":2,"question_id":12701326,"title":"Improve the performance of a sum (C version)","body":"<p>I am using a scientific calculation code.

If there are no available CLR threads, it gets queued up in the application level queue (which has bad performance)  </p>\n\n<p>So based on the previous understanding, my questions are the following. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In synchronous mode, does that mean 1 request per 1 CLR thread? </p>\n\n<p>*) If so, how many CONCURRENT requests can be served on a 1 CPU? Or should I ask the reverse? How may CLR threads are allowed per 1 CPU? Say, 50 CLR threads are allowed, does that mean then it's limited to serve 50 requests at any given time?

Isn't that really bad? Why would you ever set it so high since application queue has bad performance? </p></li>\n<li><p>If you are programming asynchronous page, exactly where it starts to get the benefit in the above process? </p></li>\n<li><p>I researched and see that by default, IIS 6.0's threadpool size is 256. 5000 concurrent requests comes in, handled by 256 IIS 6.0 threads and then each of the 256 threads, hands it off to CLR threads which i'm guessing is even lower by default.  isn't that itself asynchronous?

The tests are based on the tests mentioned above, but are selecting the first children of multiple elements, rather than a single element.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I am missing?  A technique that I should be using?  Or is this an issue than one should never worry about?  Is there a reason to not include a function like this in jQuery?</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","performance","jquery-selectors"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":125,"score":4,"question_id":7897368,"title":"Is there a more efficient way to write $('parent > child')?","body":"<p>Given the following selector $('parent > child'), I believe jQuery will first query for all 'child' elements before filtering down to those that are direct descendants of 'parent'.

I have a lot of divs in which I use draggable and resizable I also use jquery-ui-effects .hide and .show with slide animation to move some divs around.</p>\n\n<p>When I start the application everything works flawlessly but after 10~15 min that the page has been open everything that uses jquery-ui methods gets so slow that it's unusable. When I try to resize one of my divs there is a major slow down when I first mousedown on the corner and after I let go of the click it takes some seconds for the page to become responsive again. Same is true for drag and drop. Calling $().draggable and $().resizable on the divs also takes a lot of time. Strangely the dragging and resizing itself is not slow, only starting/ending it. The longer the page has been open the slower it gets.</p>\n\n<p>All other functionality in the page works just fine even after one hour of the page being open (I even have some basic canvas drawing in place, other jquery but not jquery-ui functionality also works ok). There is no aparent memory leak since the browser never goes over 150mb of memory used.</p>\n\n<p>Some people might say that the problem are my start/stop resize/drag functions. \nIt's not that because I tried to remove them without any change in speed and also it would not explain the slow down on the animations.</p>\n\n<p>CPU use goes to 100% (I'm using a single core system) when animating, it stays at 0% when not using jquery-ui functions. When profiling the animation function (after the page being open for more than 30 min) I see that there is a method named curCSS (jquery-1.8.1.js line 6672) using 95% of the CPU time. This same function only uses 4.5% if I execute the animation a few seconds after starting the application.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using jquery-1.8.1 and jquery-ui 1.8.22.</p>\n\n<p>I can't post all the code because I don't know what part of it is wrong and the whole code-base is huge.

I am using the Flickr.NET library to interact with Flickr.</p>\n\n<p>My Flickr structure is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2012 (Collection)\n<ul>\n<li>Artists (Collection)\n<ul>\n<li>Artist1 (Set)\n<ul>\n<li>Photo1</li>\n<li>Photo2</li>\n<li>Photo3</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And so on, so forth. There can, of course, be more childcollections and more sets under these collections.</p>\n\n<p>On the page I'm only interested in showing the sets (the collection is basically just for structuring the galleries so it's easier for the photographers to work with in Lightroom) I've written a recursive method to loop through the collections getting their sets. Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static List&lt;CollectionSet&gt; _photoSets;\npublic void GetFlickrPhotosetsRecursive(List&lt;Collection&gt; collections)\n    {\n        // Loop through the collections\n        foreach (var collection in collections)\n        {\n            // Base case: this collection has no childcollections and have got at least one set\n            if (collection.Collections.Count == 0 &amp;&amp; collection.Sets.Count &gt; 0)\n            {\n                _photoSets.AddRange(collection.Sets);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                // Check if this collection has got any sets\n                if (collection.Sets.Count &gt; 0)\n                    _photoSets.AddRange(collection.Sets);\n\n                // Call method again with child collections\n                GetFlickrPhotosetsRecursive(collection.Collections.ToList());\n            }   \n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This runs smooth without any performance problems at all. Reason for this is, that Collections, child collections and sets are loaded in one call to the Flickr API. Now, when I need to get the photos of each of the sets, this causes some serious performanceproblems. It takes almost 10 seconds to load the page since each photo lookup is a call to the API. Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GetFlickrPhotosetsRecursive(collections.ToList());\n\nreturn _photoSets.Select(set =&gt; new FlickrGallery()\n                                {\n                                     PhotoCollection = GetPhotosFromPhotoSet(set.SetId),\n                                     SetId = set.SetId, \n                                     Title = set.Title\n                                 }).ToList();\n\npublic PhotosetPhotoCollection GetPhotosFromPhotoSet(string setId)\n{\n    return _flickr.PhotosetsGetPhotos(setId);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The FlickrGallery object is an object of mine to store the information I need on the frontend.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone know of a better way to do this to prevent huge load times? This is still proof of concept and there's only 30 sets with 1 - 5 photos each. Can't imagine the load time when it goes live with 80+ sets with 40+ photos in each set :-)</p>\n\n<p>Any help/hint on this is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>\n\n<p>All the best,</p>\n\n<p>Bo</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","ruby-on-rails-3","performance","optimization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":73,"score":2,"question_id":12630561,"title":"Improve performance of this server code to look up domains?","body":"<p>We use Ruby to check domain availability, but the code runs painfully slow.

This is a clean install of the OS, and clean install of VS, including SP1.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if anyone has experienced this. The editor (not designers or anything else, just the text editor) is extremely unusable. By that I mean that editing text is a sort of herky-jerky experience where it seems there are certain actions that cause lag. Ctrl+Backspace for example, noticeable lag. Scrolling up or down a source file with the arrow keys also seems to lag.</p>\n\n<p>It's difficult to explain this \"lag\". It feels like the editor isn't keeping up with my typing speed.</p>\n\n<p>I've run VS2008 on Windows XP and Server 2003 (as a desktop) without this problem. On those the editor is as snappy as TextPad or any other, simpler editing application.</p>\n\n<p>Also on this same machine VS2010 does not exhibit the behavior. The editor works fine.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the problem reminds me of the horrible performance of the VS2005 editor, which I had to stop using because it was unbearable. Most of my initial .NET 2.0 experience was obtained by using vim and a NAnt file, actually, until I upgraded to VS2008.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I've tried so far, without success:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off change tracking.</li>\n<li>Turn off delimiter highlighting (1)</li>\n<li>Turn off as much screen candy as possible (line numbers, selection margin, etc)</li>\n<li>Turn off the navigation bar (this was one of the recommended actions to fix VS2005).</li>\n<li>Turn off \"Underline errors in the editor\" and \"Show live semantic errors\"</li>\n<li>Turn off automatic formatting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>(1) Is this a bug in VS? I turned it off and it continues to highlight braces!?</em></p>\n\n<p>I even installed a hotfix dated from March 2008 that supposedly fixed a problem with the HTML source editor that I never installed anywhere else before, but that didn't have any effect either.</p>\n\n<p>From the OS perspective I've tried turning off all animations, effects, themes and eye candy. Also to no avail. An interesting thing though, when running Win7 without themes the treeview in the solution explorer tends to flash uncontrollably when it gains or loses the focus. With eye candy turned on it stops flashing.</p>\n\n<p>The problem occurs in any type of project, with any number of files open or closed. It also happens with Intellisense turned off; however once I turn off Intellisense there isn't much point to using VS, so I'd like to keep it. But in any case it has no effect.</p>\n\n<p>Finally my question: <strong>Has anyone run into this problem? And if so, is it fixable? Does anyone know if MS is planning another VS2008 service pack to fix Win7 problems or something like that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I write text 8-10 hours a day on this thing and I can't deal with these problems. I don't care about fancy designers and thingamajigs but at the very least I need the editor to perform reasonably.</p>\n\n<p><sub>(Note: To head off one line of reasoning here, I can't upgrade this project to VS2010 yet. Maybe in a few months but not now. So I need VS2008 to work <em>now</em>).</sub></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong> This is C#, by the way. I haven't tried C++ or VB. I also tried switching fonts from ProggyClean (my fav) to Consolas to Courier New and back, no effect. Another thing: A symptom seems to be excessive flashing of the caret, especially when hitting Enter. It's like blink-blink-blink--blinkblinkblinkblink-blink-blink. If that makes sense.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","query","indexing","performance","logging"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":4,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3272,"score":9,"question_id":1277865,"title":"MySQL indexes - how many are enough?","body":"<p>I'm trying to fine-tune my MySQL server so I check my settings, analyzing slow-query log, and simplify my queries if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is enough if I am indexing correctly, sometimes not.

I have a list of objects in a static deck. In this context, each object has a static integer key, which can be used against the class to get the static copy of that object. This is fine. However, I then need to assign a variable number of these objects (by cloning them) to other objects; let us call the the assigned objects <code>Properties</code> and the recipient of the assignments <code>Things</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is necessary because the static deck only provides static information, i.e. members and methods that are always the same no matter the state of the <code>Property</code> assigned to the <code>Thing</code>. These properties may change in an instance, such as being turned on or off, or being ratcheted up along a predefined scale of values.</p>\n\n<p><code>Properties</code> can provide methods, but we do not know that the property exists without asking for it, much the way a hashtable works. If it doesn't exist, ideally we get a null and can't run the method associated with the <code>Property</code>. </p>\n\n<p>This is in essence a very fluid form of polymorphism, but the end result should be something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We create a <code>Thing</code>, and it runs a method internally which, based\non certain initial values provided in the constructor assigns <code>Properties</code> to itself accordingly.</p></li>\n<li><p>When certain conditions occur, such as a keystroke event, mouse\nevent, or signal from another object in the program, we look to see\nif the <code>Property</code> associated with that control signal or other signal\nexists, and try to run the method. If not, we handle the failure\naccordingly.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My first thought was to simply make a copy of the static deck for each <code>Thing</code>, but if there become a large list of properties some of which may only be used by very few <code>Things</code>, we run into a problem of potentially wasting swaths of space. Or, we run into the situation of wasting <em>some</em> space and leaving certain array indexes pointing to null values. It's a fast solution, but unideal. It places certain fairly strong conceptual limits on the number of <code>Things</code> that can be around in the program at once, and indeed it means that if other users add new Properties it will expand memory usage in an unintuitive way.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, we are able to give unique ID's to each <code>Property</code> without a problem. But how can one create a data structure to hold these <code>Properties</code> that permits easy access (close to <strong>O(1)</strong>) while also not itself using a bunch of space? Does such a structure exist, or can it be created using the structures Java provides? Is it simply a special case of a Hashtable (<code>Hashtable&lt;Integer,Property&gt;</code>) ? In my experience, using a hashtable for integers is not generally a large gain over a sparse array. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, if we assume 12 bytes per reference, a 1000 property static deck would add 12000 bytes to each <code>Thing</code>. Since it's likely to be sparse, does the tradeoff where Things with a large number of properties exceeding the 12000 byte get balanced off by the number of Things which have few? And what about the access penalty (which granted will not be based on the number of <code>Properties</code>, but on the Hash algorithm) I'm not accounting for <code>Property</code> size, which may vary since it is an interface.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas are appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","database","performance"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":92,"score":2,"question_id":12590501,"title":"Performance hit when persisting hundreds of millions of SQL Timestamp objects","body":"<p>During execution of a program that relies on the <code>oracle.sql</code> package  there is a large performance hit for persisting > 200 million Timestamps when compared to persisting the same number of longs.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/62491\" rel=\"nofollow\">Basic Schema</a></p>\n\n<p>Java to persist:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>Collection&lt;ARRAY&gt; longs = new ArrayList&lt;ARRAY&gt;(SIZE);\nCollection&lt;ARRAY&gt; timeStamps = new ArrayList&lt;ARRAY&gt;(SIZE);\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE;i++)  \n{  \n    longs.add(new ARRAY(description, connection, i));  \n    timeStamps.add(new ARRAY(description,connection,new Timestamp(new Long(i)));\n}  \n\nStatement timeStatement = conn.createStatement();  \nstatement.setObject(1,timeStamps);  \nstatement.execute();   //5 minutes\n\nStatement longStatement = conn.createStatement();  \nstatement.setObject(1,longs);  \nstatement.execute();  //1 minutes 15 seconds\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is what does Oracle do to Timestamps that make them so awful to insert in a bulk manner?</p>\n\n<p>Configuration:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>64 bit RHEL 5  \njre 6u16  \nojdbc14.jar\n64 GB dedicated to the JVM\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>\n  <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> is being used</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","performance","apache","benchmarking"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":38,"score":2,"question_id":12609790,"title":"Website Benchmarking using ab","body":"<p>I am trying my hand at various benchmarking tools for the website I am working on and have found <code>Apache Bench</code> (ab) to be an excellent tool for load testing.

The problem is that I have another code in Matlab that makes this same thing in 0.05 seconds. In my experiments, I am receiving several matrices like matrix a every second, so 0.5 seconds is too much.</p>\n\n<p>Now the matlab code to calculate this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>aa=sum(a.*a,2); bb=sum(b.*b,2); ab=a*b'; \nd = sqrt(abs(repmat(aa,[1 size(bb,1)]) + repmat(bb',[size(aa,1) 1]) - 2*ab));\n[minz index]=min(d,[],2);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ok. Matlab code is using that (x-a)^2 = x^2 + a^2 - 2ab.</p>\n\n<p>So my next attempt was to do the same thing. I deleted my own code to make the same calculations, but It was 1.2 seconds approx.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I tried to use different external libraries. The first attempt was Eigen:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const int descrSize = 128;\nMatrixXi a(a_size, descrSize);\nMatrixXi b(b_size, descrSize);\nMatrixXi ab(a_size, b_size);\n\nunsigned char* dataPtr = matrixa;\nfor (int i=0; i&lt;nframes; ++i)\n{\n    for (int j=0; j&lt;descrSize; ++j)\n    {\n        a(i,j)=(int)*dataPtr++;\n    }\n}\nunsigned char* vocPtr = matrixb;\nfor (int i=0; i&lt;vocabulary_size; ++i)\n{\n    for (int j=0; j&lt;descrSize; ++j)\n    {\n        b(i,j)=(int)*vocPtr ++;\n    }\n}\nab = a*b.transpose();\na.cwiseProduct(a);\nb.cwiseProduct(b);\nMatrixXi aa = a.rowwise().sum();\nMatrixXi bb = b.rowwise().sum();\nMatrixXi d = (aa.replicate(1,vocabulary_size) + bb.transpose().replicate(nframes,1) - 2*ab).cwiseAbs2();\n\nint* index = NULL;\nindex = (int*)malloc(nframes*sizeof(int));\nfor (int i=0; i&lt;nframes; ++i)\n{\n    d.row(i).minCoeff(&amp;index[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This Eigen code costs 1.2 approx for just the line that says: ab = a*b.transpose();</p>\n\n<p>A similar code using opencv was used also, and the cost of the ab = a*b.transpose(); was 0.65 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>So, It is real annoying that matlab is able to do this same thing so quickly and I am not able in C++! Of course being able to run my experiment would be great, but I think the lack of knowledge is what really is annoying me. How can I achieve at least the same performance than in Matlab? Any kind of soluting is welcome. I mean, any external library (free if possible), loop unrolling things, template things, SSE intructions (I know they exist), cache things. As I said, my main purpose is increase my knowledge for being able to code thinks like this with a faster performance.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: more code suggested by David Hammen.

You can visualize these measurement devices as a bunch of lab trolleys, each with a lot of cables connected to the machine, each delivering measurement data. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Data Model:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is measurement data from every spot and every device for every parameter, for example once a minute over a period of 6 days. My job is to store that data in a database and to provide efficient access to it.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a device has a unique name</li>\n<li>a parameter also has a name; they're not unique though, so it also has an ID</li>\n<li>a spot has an ID</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project database is more complex of course, but these details don't seem relevant to the issue.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a measurement data <em>index</em> has an ID, a time stamp for when the measurement was done and references to the device and the spot on which the measurement was carried out</li>\n<li>a measurement data <em>value</em> has a reference to the parameter and to the value that was actually measured</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Initially, I had modeled the measurement data value to have its own ID as primary key; the <code>n:m</code> relationship between measurement data index and value was a separate table that only stored <code>index:value</code> ID pairs, but as that table itself consumed quite a lot of harddrive space, we eliminated it and changed the value ID to be a simple integer that stores the ID of the measurement data index it belongs to; the primary key of the measurement data value is now composed of that ID and the parameter ID.</p>\n\n<p><em>On a side note</em>: When I created the data model, I carefully followed common design guidelines like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form\" rel=\"nofollow\">3NF</a> and appropriate table constraints (such as unique keys); another rule of thumb was to create an index for every foreign key. I have a suspicion that the deviation in the measurement data index / value tables from 'strict' 3NF might be one of the reasons for the performance issues I am looking at now, but changing the data model back has not solved the problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Data Model in DDL:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is an update to this code further below.</p>\n\n<p>The script below creates the database and all tables involved.

The basic result is that they're all too slow, but their query plan was way too complex for me to understand, so I went back to the really simple query used above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have looked into <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-partitioning.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">partitioning</a> the value table. The data is time-related and partitioning seems an appropriate means to organize that kind of data; even the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-partitioning.html#DDL-PARTITIONING-IMPLEMENTATION\" rel=\"nofollow\">examples</a> in the PostgreSQL documentation use something similar. However, I read in the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-partitioning.html#DDL-PARTITIONING-OVERVIEW\" rel=\"nofollow\">same article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical memory of the database server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entire test database is less than 1GB in size and I am running my tests on a development machine with 8GB of RAM and on a virtual machine with 1GB (see also environment below), so the table is far from being very large or even exceeding the physical memory. I might implement partitioning anyway at some stage, but I have a feeling that approach does not target the performance problem itself.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I am considering to <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/sql-cluster.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cluster</a> the value table. I dislike the fact that clustering must be re-done whenever new data is inserted and that it furthermore requires an exclusive read/write lock, but looking at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/9436055/217844\">this</a> SO question, it seems that it anyway has its benefits and might be an option. However, clustering is done on an index and as there are up to 4 selection criteria going into a query (devices, spots, parameters and time), I would have to create clusters for all of them - which in turn gives me the impression that I'm simply not creating the right indexes...</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Environment:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>development is taking place on a MacBook Pro (mid-2009) with a dual-core CPU and 8GB of RAM</li>\n<li>I am running database performance tests on a virtual Debian 6.0 machine with 1GB of RAM, hosted on the MBP</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL version is 9.1 as that was the latest version when I installed it, upgrading to 9.2 would be possible</li>\n<li>I have changed <code>shared_buffers</code> from the default 1600kB to 25% of RAM on both machines as recommended in the <a href=\"http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server#shared_buffers\" rel=\"nofollow\">PostgreSQL docs</a> (which involved enlarging <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/kernel-resources.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">kernel settings</a> like SHMALL, SHMMAX, etc.)</li>\n<li>similarly, I have changed <a href=\"http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server#effective_cache_size\" rel=\"nofollow\">effective_cache_size</a> from the default 128MB to 50% of the RAM available</li>\n<li>I ran performance test with different <a href=\"http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server#work_mem\" rel=\"nofollow\">work_mem</a> settings, but did not see any major difference in performance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> One aspect that I believe is important is that the performance test series with real queries from the project do not differ performance-wise between the MacBook with 8GB and the virtual machine with 1GB; i.e. if a query takes 10s on the MacBook, it also takes 10s on the VM. Also, I ran the same performance tests before and after changing <code>shared_buffers</code>, <code>effective_cache_size</code> and <code>work_mem</code> and the configuration changes did not improve performance by more than 10%; some results in fact even got worse, so it seems any difference is caused rather by test variation than by configuration change.

I did not expect any major query performance improvement from this (I was wrong), but I feel it makes the measurement data index concept clearer. While it requires fractionally more storage space (according to some rather crude estimate), having a 'static' index table might also help in deployment when <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/manage-ag-tablespaces.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tablespaces</a> are moved to different harddrives according to their read/write requirements.</li>\n<li>use a surrogate key in device table: From what I understand, a surrogate key is a primary key that is not strictly required from a database design point of view (e.g. device name is already unique, so it could also serve as PK), but might help to improve query performance.

So that's why I programmed the staff by myself...</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>#include &lt;mex.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;matrix.h&gt;\n\nvoid mexFunction(\n    int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[],\n    int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[])\n{\n    double epsilon = ((double)(mxGetScalar(prhs[0])));\n    int strengthDim = ((int)(mxGetScalar(prhs[1])));\n    int lenPartMat = ((int)(mxGetScalar(prhs[2])));\n    int numParts = ((int)(mxGetScalar(prhs[3])));\n    double *partMat = mxGetPr(prhs[4]);\n    const mxArray* verletListCells = prhs[5];\n    mxArray *verletList;\n\n    double *pseSum = (double *) malloc(numParts * sizeof(double));\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; numParts; i++) pseSum[i] = 0.0;\n\n    float *tempVar = NULL;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; numParts; i++)\n    {\n        verletList = mxGetCell(verletListCells,i);\n        int numberVerlet = mxGetM(verletList);\n\n        tempVar = (float *) realloc(tempVar, numberVerlet * sizeof(float) * 2);\n\n\n        for(int a = 0; a &lt; numberVerlet; a++)\n        {\n            tempVar[a*2] = partMat[((int) (*(mxGetPr(verletList) + a))) - 1] - partMat[i];\n            tempVar[a*2 + 1] = partMat[((int) (*(mxGetPr(verletList) + a))) - 1 + lenPartMat] - partMat[i + lenPartMat];\n\n            tempVar[a*2] = pow(tempVar[a*2],2);\n            tempVar[a*2 + 1] = pow(tempVar[a*2 + 1],2);\n\n            tempVar[a*2] = tempVar[a*2] + tempVar[a*2 + 1];\n            tempVar[a*2] = sqrt(tempVar[a*2]);\n\n            tempVar[a*2] = 4.0/(pow(epsilon,2) * M_PI) * exp(-(pow((tempVar[a*2]/epsilon),2)));\n            pseSum[i] = pseSum[i] + ((partMat[((int) (*(mxGetPr(verletList) + a))) - 1 + 2*lenPartMat] - partMat[i + (2 * lenPartMat)]) * tempVar[a*2]);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    plhs[0] = mxCreateDoubleMatrix(numParts,1,mxREAL);\n    for(int a = 0; a &lt; numParts; a++)\n    {\n        *(mxGetPr(plhs[0]) + a) = pseSum[a];\n    }\n\n    free(tempVar);\n    free(pseSum);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this is the improved version, which is about 12 times faster than MATLAB version.

It means that the guys that made the compiler had some reasons for treating <code>++i</code> and <code>i+=1</code> differently. <strong>My question is</strong> why would they ever do so?</p>\n\n<p>Is it just because it was hard/impossible to make compilers advanced enough to perform such optimizations those days? Or maybe on some very specific platforms/hardware/in some special scenario it actually makes sense to make a difference between <code>++i</code> and <code>i+=1</code> and other stuff of that kind?

I've had and idea of measuring 1) 'normal' frequency, 2) current frequency, 3) min, 4) max.  And I'd like to measure these over multiple buckets of time.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a webservice could get 10 messages in 100 ms, then not get any messages for 5 minutes.  In the UI example it could be running at 60 FPS for 10 seconds straight, then a GC hits and a single frame could be 'frozen' for 1 second, which completely ruins the UI effect.</p>\n\n<p>I think these kinds of measurements could be done using a set of 'buckets' for collecting measurements.  But unlike <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\" rel=\"nofollow\">time series</a> the FPS measurement I care about most is the one that DOESN'T arrive at the normal interval (normal in the UI example is a single frame drawn every 1/60th of a sec, but the one I care about is 60x longer).  So to be useful both in the normal case and the exceptional case, one could use a hierarchy of 'sample buckets'.</p>\n\n<p>1..10 'micro' buckets, each measures 1/10th of a second<br>\nmany 'micro' buckets are needed to keep an accurate sliding window at the 'normal' level<br></p>\n\n<p>1..60 'normal' buckets, each 1 sec<br>\n1..60 'macro' buckets, each 1 min<br>\n... levels could continue: hours, days, months, years</p>\n\n<p>A set of metrics (avg, min, max, count) could be kept per bucket at each level.  When the time period for a bucket expires the bucket could be 'promoted' to the next level and combined into a 'sample queue' at that level.  This would give an accurate sliding-window measurement of each aggregate per bucket at each 'level' in the hierarchy, while using relatively little CPU or memory.</p>\n\n<p>In a development environment I think samples at the 'micro' level could be used to identify real-time problems while debugging.  In production the 'normal' level could be displayed to the end user while the 'macro' level could be stored for long-term trending and analysis (to establish a long-term baseline).  Once patterns are identified it seems like it would be easy to programatically log or react to significant changes in a metric (like the message rate drop-off to flush memory caches) without overreacting to acceptable anamolies (like the GC pause in the UI).</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a bit long, but it seems like a simple idea and I couldn't find any classes or frameworks that do this on the web (at least not in my framework of choice, .NET).  Is this a known pattern for measuring and evaluating the health of applications, systems, or measurements and I just couldn't find it?  Any monitoring library or statistical recipe available via open source or over-the-counter?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.  Because of the possible high rate of sampling I didn't think PerformanceCounters on Windows would be a good fit at the 'micro' level (updating metrics many times per second in some cases, like real-time display of UI FPS).  Also, it would be great if the solution worked on Mono and Silverlight (were PerfCounters aren't available).\nP.P.S.  I spent a couple of hours looking for statistics libraries in .NET, and found a couple, but couldn't find a simple 'hierarchical time-bounded sampling' like I describe above.  Lots of count bounded sampling, which doesn't apply here, because data streams like redraw rate and message arrival rate don't alway occur at regular intervals.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","performance","umbraco"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":164,"score":1,"question_id":12420707,"title":"Umbraco: differences between Node, DynamicNode, Content","body":"<p>Then there are many class that represents Umbraco documents:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1) umbraco.cms.businesslogic.Content\n2) umbraco.cms.businesslogic.web.Document\n3) umbraco.MacroEngines.DynamicNode\n4) umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory.Node\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Are there any others?</p>\n\n<p>Can you explain what they do, and when to use them?</p>\n\n<p>The class number 3 and 4 seem the same.

Using <em>Instruments</em> to track retain/release events, I realized that the compiler introduces a LOT of retain/release pairs in area where you would not do it (in pre ARC environment).

Hence, there was little room for improvement by switching to ARC.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, <em>Instruments</em> was able to show me the most costly retain/released introduced by ARC and I was able to deactivate them using __unsafe_unretained.

Thanks in advance..!</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","performance","optimization"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1121,"score":6,"question_id":2985797,"title":"Tips for making a fraction calculator code more optimized (faster and using less memory)","body":"<p>Basicly, what I need for the program to do is to act a as simple fraction calculator (for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) for the a single line of input, for example:<br>\n-input: <code>1/7 + 3/5</code><br>\n-output: <code>26/35</code></p>\n\n<p>My initial code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import sys\n\ndef euclid(numA, numB):\n    while numB != 0:\n        numRem = numA % numB\n        numA = numB\n        numB = numRem\n    return numA\n\nfor wejscie in sys.stdin:\n    wyjscie = wejscie.split(' ')\n    a, b = [int(x) for x in wyjscie[0].split(\"/\")]\n    c, d = [int(x) for x in wyjscie[2].split(\"/\")]\n    if wyjscie[1] == '+':\n        licz = a * d + b * c\n        mian= b * d\n        nwd = euclid(licz, mian)\n        konA = licz/nwd\n        konB = mian/nwd\n        wynik = str(konA) + '/' + str(konB)\n        print(wynik)\n    elif wyjscie[1] == '-':\n        licz= a * d - b * c\n        mian= b * d\n        nwd = euclid(licz, mian)\n        konA = licz/nwd\n        konB = mian/nwd\n        wynik = str(konA) + '/' + str(konB)\n        print(wynik)\n    elif wyjscie[1] == '*':\n        licz= a * c\n        mian= b * d\n        nwd = euclid(licz, mian)\n        konA = licz/nwd\n        konB = mian/nwd\n        wynik = str(konA) + '/' + str(konB)\n        print(wynik)\n    else:\n        licz= a * d\n        mian= b * c\n        nwd = euclid(licz, mian)\n        konA = licz/nwd\n        konB = mian/nwd\n        wynik = str(konA) + '/' + str(konB)\n        print(wynik)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which I reduced to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import sys\n\ndef euclid(numA, numB):\n    while numB != 0:\n        numRem = numA % numB\n        numA = numB\n        numB = numRem\n    return numA\n\nfor wejscie in sys.stdin:\n    wyjscie = wejscie.split(' ')\n    a, b = [int(x) for x in wyjscie[0].split(\"/\")]\n    c, d = [int(x) for x in wyjscie[2].split(\"/\")]\n    if wyjscie[1] == '+':\n        print(\"/\".join([str((a * d + b * c)/euclid(a * d + b * c, b * d)),str((b * d)/euclid(a * d + b * c, b * d))]))\n    elif wyjscie[1] == '-':\n        print(\"/\".join([str((a * d - b * c)/euclid(a * d - b * c, b * d)),str((b * d)/euclid(a * d - b * c, b * d))]))\n    elif wyjscie[1] == '*':\n        print(\"/\".join([str((a * c)/euclid(a * c, b * d)),str((b * d)/euclid(a * c, b * d))]))\n    else:\n        print(\"/\".join([str((a * d)/euclid(a * d, b * c)),str((b * c)/euclid(a * d, b * c))]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any advice on how to improve this futher is welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: one more thing that I forgot to mention - the code can not make use of any libraries apart from sys.</p>\n"},{"tags":["performance","openlayers"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":80,"score":1,"question_id":10845258,"title":"OpenLayers - best way to display a lots of data?","body":"<p>I have a slippy map over which I want to display a overlay with some highways.
