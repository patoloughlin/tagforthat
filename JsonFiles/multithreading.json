a basic shell in C for an IRC bot with another thread running in the background","body":"<p>At the moment I have a very simple IRC bot written in C.  When I run it, it sets up the connection and joins the specified channel.  All the connection details are hard-coded, but this is not an issue.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is have a basic shell run at the same time, meaning the loop I currently have to receive text from the IRC channel and parse it is running in a thread in the background.  From this shell, I want to be able to run commands that may send messages to the IRC channel, or may terminate the program gracefully (meaning both threads will need to be closed).  This shell is not meant to be any kind of job control shell.</p>\n\n<p>The primary point of this bot is to monitor the channel for any URLs posted and store them in an SQLite database.  People in the IRC channel will then be able to search the database for particular URLs.  I also want to be able to perform various database commands from the shell, such as search, but also manual insertions and deletions.  I mention this because I assume I will need to ensure all database access is thread-safe.  Also, ideally, I'd prefer insertions to database to be prioritised over searching, but this is practically last on my list of requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the chance that some commands received from the IRC channel could be spawned off into their own threads.  This could be because they are accessing the database, something which definitely has the potential to be less than instant, but also because they are calling a method to block the thread for a period of time to stagger the transmission of messages to the channel.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I'm asking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How do I go about setting up this sort of program? What sort of structure do I need to run two main threads at once and potentially pass messages between the two?</li>\n<li>Does access to the socket used for communicating to the IRC channel need to be thread-safe?</li>\n<li>How should I go about making the program thread-safe? Will mutex suffice?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If it matters, the program will almost certainly be running on an Ubuntu Server distribution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","multithreading","architecture","software-engineering"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":1,"question_id":13261769,"title":"Best architecture to set a realtime logging window to write from different threads like output window in visualstudio","body":"<p>I am designing an application and it runs different components each on a different thread.

However I noticed that using file monitor does not perform very well, and it slows downs the component threads and their tasks. So I was thinking to create something like the output windows in vs2010, where they can log any data while debugging, it seems to be very efficient, and can hold a lot of data.

Now I'm <em>occasionally</em> getting the following error when quitting (<code>System.exit(0)</code>) an application (with a Swing GUI) that I'm developing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Exception while removing reference: java.lang.InterruptedException\njava.lang.InterruptedException\n        at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue.remove(ReferenceQueue.java:118)\n        at java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue.remove(ReferenceQueue.java:134)\n        at sun.java2d.Disposer.run(Disposer.java:125)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, given that it started to happen with a more concurrency-capable hardware, and it has to do with threads, and it happens occasionally, it's obviously some kind of timing thing. But the problem is that the stack trace is so short. All I have is the listing above. It doesn't include my own code at all, so it's somewhat hard to guess where the bug is.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone experienced something like this before? Any ideas how to start solving it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since quitting a Swing application with <code>System.exit(0)</code> may be \"unclean\", but I don't want to set the main frame to <code>EXIT_ON_CLOSE</code> because I want to ensure that there's nothing critical going on when the application quits, I added a mechanism so that it executes the main frame's <code>dispose()</code> method before calling <code>System.exit(0)</code>. So it should be pretty clean now, but the occasional exception still happens. It happens after the <code>System.exit(0)</code> has been called; <code>dispose()</code> works with no problems. That is, it must be coming from a shutdown hook:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainFrame.dispose(); // No problem! After this returns, all visible GUI is gone.\n// In fact, if there were no other threads around, the VM could terminate here.\nSystem.exit(0); // Throws an InterruptedException from sun.java2d.Disposer.run\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I even tried explicitly disposing all <code>Window</code>s by looping through <code>Window.getWindows()</code> array (it contains ownerless <code>Dialog</code>s and such), but it made no difference. This issue seems to have little to do with \"cleanness\" (i.e. explicitly releasing native screen resources before quitting). It's something else, but what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Setting the default close operation to <code>EXIT_ON_CLOSE</code> made no difference. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=sun.java2d.Disposer.run(Disposer.java:125\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/search?q=sun.java2d.Disposer.run(Disposer.java:125</a>) finds a few bug reports, so maybe this indeed is a bug in Sun's Java2D implementation. I could imagine that bugs like this can go unfixed for a long time, because they're pretty harmless in practice; an exception from a shutdown hook hardly hurts anyone else. Given that this happens in a GUI app, the exception is not even noticed unless the <code>stderr</code> is directed to a console or log.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","multithreading"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":6,"up_vote_count":12,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":8222,"score":12,"question_id":1160137,"title":"Execute Background Task In Javascript","body":"<p>I have a cpu intensive task that I need to run on the client.

Here's the block of code calling it:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Ruby code\nreaction :hello do |event|\n  system \"spotify pause\"\n  system \"say 'Hello world'\"\n  system \"spotify play\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This block is run periodically via a <code>yield</code> statement, when a particular event is triggered through a socket connection. The script is also daemonized, using the ruby gem \"daemons\", to allow it to run in the background (but still as the current user, according to <code>ps</code> and the ruby environment variable). Not only this, but each socket connection starts a new thread, so the code is run in a separate thread from the main one.</p>\n\n<p>In my debugging I've tried running the line <code>system \"spotify pause\"</code> after the daemon starts up the script, without a problem. It also runs fine in the following script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread.new do\n  system(\"spotify pause\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it isn't starting a new thread or daemonizing in itself that causes the problem, but it seems to be a combination of these things and maybe the fact that the block is being yielded  that means that an abort trap is being raised by the AppleScript in the bash script.</p>\n\n<p>If you can drag yourself up the many, many layers of complication back into reality, I would appreciate any suggestions you have for solving or even debugging this weird case!</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","multithreading","exception"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1164,"score":2,"question_id":7128670,"title":"Best practice: AsyncTask during orientation change","body":"<p>AsyncTask is a great thing to run complex tasks in another thread.</p>\n\n<p>But when there is an orientation change or another configuration change while the AsyncTask is still running, the current activity is destroyed and restarted.

I am using FFTW to perform a large set (100,000) of 64 x 64 x 64 FFTs and inverse FFTs. In my current implementation, I use a parallel for loop and allocate the storage arrays within the loop. I have noticed that my CPU usage only tops out at about 60-70% in these cases. (Note this is still better utilization than the built in threaded FFTs provided by FFTW which I have tested). Since I am using fftw_malloc, is it possible that excessive locking is occurring which is preventing full usage?</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, is it advisable to preallocate the storage arrays for each thread before the main processing loop, so no locks are required within the loop itself?

As <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/315144/sonicoder\">sonicoder</a> noted, branch prediction may cause tmp to be NULL when the if returns true.

This single thread sits inside <code>poll()</code> most of the time (I've already converted this to <code>select()</code>, on Windows), the network thread only waking up when there's incoming network data.  When a client command arrives, the network thread fires the command off to a worker thread to actually perform work on the back-end, and then goes back to listening for more incoming commands.  Commands are asynchronous -- multiple commands can come in on one socket, one right after the next.  At any one time, there can be dozens of outstanding commands on a single connection, all being worked on in various worker threads.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that when the worker thread wants to send response data, the network thread is probably asleep inside <code>poll()</code> at the time that the worker thread is trying to send its result.

This approach aims to take a collection of threads and delegate their work to a diversity of \"units of work.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Here's how it's glued together.  First, a simple class to wrap a diversity of workers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ThreadWorker\n{\n    internal void RunInternal()\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            Run();\n        }\n        catch (SystemException)\n        {\n            throw;\n        }\n        catch (Exception)\n        {\n        }\n    }\n\n    public virtual void Run()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public virtual void OnStop()\n    {\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, the code to keep a series of threads alive indefinitely.  This involves a list of threads, a list of \"workers\" (one per thread), and an infinite loop that checks the status of each thread on a given interval.</p>\n\n<p>Note that an exception that terminates a thread won't tear down the other threads.  If an unhandled exception is encountered, the thread will be restarted the next time the event wait handle responds.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private readonly List&lt;Thread&gt; _threads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();\nprivate readonly List&lt;ThreadWorker&gt; _workers = new List&lt;ThreadWorker&gt;();\nprivate EventWaitHandle EventWaitHandle = new EventWaitHandle(false, EventResetMode.ManualReset);\n\npublic override void Run()\n{\n    foreach (var worker in _workers)\n    {\n        _threads.Add(new Thread(worker.RunInternal));\n    }\n\n    foreach (var thread in _threads)\n    {\n         thread.Start();\n    }\n\n    while (!EventWaitHandle.WaitOne(500))\n    {\n         // Restart any threads that have stopped running\n         for (var i = 0; i &lt; _threads.Count; i++)\n         {\n               if (_threads[i].IsAlive)\n               {\n                   continue;\n               }\n\n                _threads[i] = new Thread(_workers[i].RunInternal);\n                _threads[i].Start();\n          }\n\n          EventWaitHandle.WaitOne(2000);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Simple enough - the main thread (in this case an Azure worker role's Run method) blocks for half a second between checks to the active list of threads.  Terminated threads are re-started and the host thread then blocks for 2 seconds before checking the worker threads' health again.</p>\n\n<p>Adding workers is as simple as adding a list of classes that inherit from the ThreadWorker base class</p>\n\n<pre><code>_workers.Add(new SomeWorker());\n_workers.Add(new AnotherWorker());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And, finally, the concrete workers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SomeWorker: ThreadWorker\n{\n    public override void Run()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            // Do your long running work here.\n\n            Thread.Sleep(2000); // Take a breather - not necessary.\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class AnotherWorker: ThreadWorker\n{\n    public override void Run()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            // Do your long running work here.\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","qt","qt4","qthread"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":20,"score":0,"question_id":13212623,"title":"QThread hungs up when calling isRunning on it","body":"<p>I have a <code>QThread</code> that fetches data from the web.

Each system has its own operation queues, all performing in the background. We wish to keep all object creation and modification in the background to minimize UI performance issues, especially during initial ramp up, where thousands of objects might be created from data on the server. Here we have hit several problems with our various design attempts. Huge memory consumption during these ramp ups, and incorrect orchestration of all the contexts and child contexts, causing deadlocks and crashes.\nWe have attempted the following designs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One root <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> managed object context which has one child <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> context. The UI fetched results controllers use this child context to fetch results from. From the <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> child context, we created one <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> child context, which we called \"savingContext\" and each background operation created a child context of that \"savingContext\", did its changes, and finally did what we called a \"deep save\", recursively saving to the top. We initially chose this design to not have to deal with <code>NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification</code> notifications from many different child contexts. We wrapped every call to the <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> contexts and access to objects with <code>performBlockAndWait:</code>. Functionally, this design performed. All changes and inserts were saved to the persistent store, and UI was updated with the changes. This, introduced two issues. One was laggy UI during ramp up because of merged changes going through the <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> child context, and more importantly, very high memory usage during ramp up. We would hit prohibitive RAM usages due to inability to call <code>reset</code> recursively on contexts (as the main UI child context is there too) and/or lack of knowledge when to call <code>refreshObject:mergeChanges:</code>. So we went a different road.</li>\n<li>Have two top-level contexts linked with the persistent store coordinator, one <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> for save child contexts, and a <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> for UI display. The <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> listens to <code>NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification</code> notifications from the main <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> context and merges them in the main thread. Each background operation creates a child context of the main <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> context, also with private queue concurrency type, does what it does, performs a \"deep save\" recursively, which performs a save on the current context, a recursive call of deep save to its parent, calls reset on the current context and saves again. This way we avoid the memory issues, as created objects are released quickly after save. However, with this design, we have hit a plethora of issues such as dead locks, <code>NSInternalInconsistencyException</code> exceptions and fetched results controllers not updating the UI despite there being save notifications for the <code>NSMainQueueConcurrencyType</code> context. This also cause initial load times in the UI to slow a lot. In the previous design, the fetched results controller returned results very fast, while this has the UI blocked for several seconds until the view loads (we initialize the fetched results controller in <code>viewDidLoad</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We have tried many intermediate designs, but they all revolve around the same issues, either very high memory usage, fetched results controller not updating the UI or deadlocks and <code>NSInternalInconsistencyException</code> exceptions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am really getting frustrated. I can't but feel as if our designs are overtly complicated for something that should be rather simple, and it is just our lack of understanding some fundamental that is killing us.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So what would you guys suggest? What arrangement would you recommend for our contexts? How should we manage different contexts in different threads? Best practices for freeing up inserted objects and resetting contexts? Avoiding dead locks? All help would be appreciated at this point.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have also seen recommendations for the MagicalRecords category. Is it recommended? We have are already invested in using Core Data types, how difficult would it be to migrate using MR?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","multithreading","parallel-processing","openmp"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":2,"question_id":13209686,"title":"openMP:why am I not getting different thread ids when i uses \" #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)\"","body":"<p>Why am I not getting different thread ids when I uses \" #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)\".

(How would the call of SuspendThread know when the target thread was actually suspended?)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <em>I lied.</em> I said this was for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>Well, the strange truth is that I don't see this behavior under Windows XP 64 (at least not in the last week and I don't really know what happened before that)... but we have been testing this Windows application under Wine on Ubuntu 10.x.  The <a href=\"http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/ntdll/thread.c#L766\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wine source for the guts of GetThreadContext</a> contains\nan Access Denied return response on line 819 when an attempt to grab the thread state fails for some reason. I'm guessing, but it appears that Wine GetThreadStatus believes that a thread just might not be accessible repeatedly.  Why that would be true after a SuspendThead is beyond me, but there's the code.  Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: <em>I lied again</em>.  I said we only saw the behavior on Wine.  Nope... we have now found a Vista Ultimate system that seems to produce the same error (again, rarely).   So, it appears that Wine and Windows agree on an obscure case. It also appears that the mere enabling of the Sysinternals Process monitor program aggravates the situation and causes the problem to appear on Windows XP 64; I suspect a Heisenbug.  (The Process Monitor\ndoesn't even exist on the Wine-tasting (:-) machine or the XP 64 system I use for development).</p>\n\n<p>What on earth is it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: Sept 15 2010.  I've added careful checking to the error return status, without otherwise disturbing the code, for SuspendThread, ResumeThread, and GetContext.  I haven't seen <em>any</em> hint of this behavior on Windows systems since I did that.  Haven't gotten back to the Wine experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2010: Strange.  It seems that if I compile this under VisualStudio 2005, it fails on Windows Vista and 7, but not earlier OSes.  If I compile under VisualStudio 2010, it doesn't fail anywhere.  One might point a finger at VisualStudio2005, but I'm suspicious of a location-sensitivve problem, and different optimizers in VS 2005 and VS 2010 place the code a slightly different places.</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2012: Saga continues.  We see this failure on a number of XP and Windows 7 machines, at a pretty low rate (once every several thousand runs).  Our Suspend activities are applied to threads that mostly execute pure computational code but that sometimes make calls into Windows.    I don't recall seeing this issue when the PC of the thread was in our computational code.   Of course, I can't see the PC of the thread when it hangs because GetContext won't give it to me, so I can't directly confirm that the problem only happens when executing system calls.  But, all our system calls are channeled through one point, and so far the evidence is that point was executed when we get the hang. So the indirect evidence suggests GetContext on a thread only fails if a system call is being executed by that thread.    I haven't had the energy to build a critical experiment to test this hypothesis yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":["wpf","multithreading","user-interface"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":122,"score":0,"question_id":7272683,"title":"Updating UI when XML changes","body":"<p>I have a UI in a window, which is bound to an XML file.

It also doesn't seem that it is required to have a single instance of the scope.cfc component anymore.</p>\n\n<pre><code>            &lt;cfcomponent&gt;\n                &lt;cfscript&gt;\n                variables.scope=false;\n                variables.scopeName=false;\n                &lt;/cfscript&gt;\n                &lt;cffunction name=\"init\" access=\"public\" output=\"no\" returntype=\"scope\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfargument name=\"scope\" type=\"struct\" required=\"yes\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfargument name=\"scopeName\" type=\"string\" required=\"yes\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfscript&gt;\n                    variables.scope=arguments.scope;\n                    variables.scopeName=arguments.scopeName;\n                    return this;\n                    &lt;/cfscript&gt;\n                &lt;/cffunction&gt;\n                &lt;cffunction name=\"write\" access=\"public\" output=\"no\" returntype=\"boolean\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfargument name=\"key\" type=\"string\" required=\"yes\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfargument name=\"value\" type=\"any\" requires=\"yes\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cfargument name=\"timeout\" type=\"numeric\" required=\"no\" default=\"10\"&gt;\n                    &lt;cftry&gt;\n                        &lt;cflock type=\"exclusive\" name=\"zcore-#variables.scopeName#-scope-#arguments.key#\" timeout=\"#arguments.timeout#\" throwontimeout=\"yes\"&gt;\n                            &lt;cfscript&gt;\n                            variables.scope[arguments.key]=arguments.value;\n                            &lt;/cfscript&gt;\n                        &lt;/cflock&gt;\n                        &lt;cfcatch type=\"lock\"&gt;&lt;cfreturn false&gt;&lt;/cfcatch&gt;\n                    &lt;/cftry&gt;\n                    &lt;cfreturn true&gt;\n                &lt;/cffunction&gt;\n            &lt;/cfcomponent&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>** Edit3:** I tested the performance of reading from server scope through a component method like this and found it to be 20 times slower then reading the server scope directly when using a read only lock and 4 times slower without a lock.  The overhead of an extra function call hundreds or thousands of times per request will be too slow.  Tests done on Railo 3.3.x.</p>\n\n<p>I prefer to build a large object in a non-public request and then set a single shared memory scope key then try to write an incomplete object to the scopes.  Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;cfscript&gt;\nts=structnew();\nts.largeObject=buildLargeObject();\nserver.cachedObject=ts;\n&lt;/cfscript&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This lets you avoid locking across the entire application when you only write complete objects to shared memory since updating a single struct key is thread-safe.  However, when you build the large object on startup, you need to be sure it is locked until that object is fully created.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm going to make the scope variable become directly readable by using the this scope instead of variables scope in the init function to avoid slowing down the application.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","nullpointerexception"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":1,"question_id":13205316,"title":"nullpointer exception for thread","body":"<p>I am implementing a tcp java client/server app based on a tut on the internet\nI changed some methods and get error of nullpointerexception</p>\n\n<p>The error comes from the run().

That means the same thread can lock the same mutex twice and won't deadlock. Of course it also needs to unlock it twice, otherwise no other thread can obtain the mutex.

Some systems/languages (e.g. Cocoa Objective-C) offer both, recursive and non recursive mutexes. Some languages also only offer one or the other one. E.g. in Java mutexes are always recursive (the same thread may twice \"synchronize\" on the same object). Depending on what other thread functionality they offer, not having recursive mutexes might be no problem, as they can easily be written yourself (I already implemented recursive mutexes myself on the basis of more simple mutex/condition operations).</p>\n\n<p>What I don't really understand: What are non-recursive mutexes good for? Why would I want to have a thread deadlock if it locks the same mutex twice? Even high level languages that could avoid that (e.g. testing if this will deadlock and throwing an exception if it does) usually don't do that. They will let the thread deadlock instead.</p>\n\n<p>Is this only for cases, where I accidentally lock it twice and only unlock it once and in case of a recursive mutex, it would be harder to find the problem, so instead I have it deadlock immediately to see where the incorrect lock appears? But couldn't I do the same with having a lock counter returned when unlocking and in a situation, where I'm sure I released the last lock and the counter is not zero, I can throw an exception or log the problem? Or is there any other, more useful use-case of non recursive mutexes that I fail to see? Or is it maybe just performance, as a non-recursive mutex can be slightly faster than a recursive one?

This class will respond back by raising a signal which Camera class has earlier subscibed as shown ' MainForm.OnReceiveMultipleFrameEvent += new MainForm.ReceiveMultipleFrameEvent(MainForm_OnReceiveMultipleFrameEvent)'.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>void\n  MainForm_OnReceiveMultipleFrameEvent(MainForm.ReceiveMultpleFrameEventArgs\n  e)    {       permitEntryCount++;     }</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Upon receiving the signal, permitEntryCount will be incremented thus allowing the function to be accessed again. Why i do this is because this class is created depends on how many object camera i have. If i hav 11 cameras, i would have 11 workerThread running processing this class. I queue up their frames in a non static queue and gather their first element into a static queue which is to be passed for my other process. The problem i am facing here is as below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>=============================  Count : 1760 ===============================</p>\n  \n  <p>Queue item count: 0 : isClear : True</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 17 - 3 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 3 : Camera Tag :\n  3372 : Queue item count : 1</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 24 - 6 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID :10 : Camera Tag :\n  4367 : Queue item count : 2</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 23 - 5 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 9 : Camera Tag :\n  4415 : Queue item count : 3</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 19 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 5 : Camera Tag :\n  4108 : Queue item count : 4</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 20 - 5 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 6 : Camera Tag :\n  3768 : Queue item count : 5</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 14 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 0 : Camera Tag :\n  2837 : Queue item count : 6</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 21 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 7 : Camera Tag :\n  3246 : Queue item count : 7</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 16 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 2 : Camera Tag :\n  3552 : Queue item count : 8</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 18 - 6 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 4 : Camera Tag :\n  3117 : Queue item count : 9</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 15 - 3 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID :1 : Camera Tag :\n  2315 : Queue item count : 10</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 22 - 4 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID :8 : Camera Tag :\n  4853 : Queue item count : 11</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 3 : Camera Tag : 3372 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID :10 : Camera Tag : 4367 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 9 : Camera Tag : 4415 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 5 : Camera Tag : 4108 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 6 : Camera Tag : 3768 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 0 : Camera Tag : 2837 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 7 : Camera Tag : 3246 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 2 : Camera Tag : 3552 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 4 : Camera Tag : 3117 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 1 : Camera Tag : 2315 :</p>\n  \n  <p>Current Camera ID: 8 : Camera ID : 8 : Camera Tag : 4853 :</p>\n  \n  <p>=============================  Count : 1761 ===============================</p>\n  \n  <p>Queue item count: 0 : isClear : True</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 14 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 0 : Camera Tag :\n  2838 : Queue item count : 1</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 16 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 2 : Camera Tag :\n  3553 : Queue item count : 2</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 21 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 7 : Camera Tag :\n  3247 : Queue item count : 3</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 24 - 1 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID :10 : Camera Tag :\n  4374 : Queue item count : 4</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 23 - 6 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 9 : Camera Tag :\n  4416 : Queue item count : 5</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 17 - 4 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 3 : Camera Tag :\n  3373 : Queue item count : 7</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 15 - 3 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 1 : Camera Tag :\n  2316 : Queue item count : 7</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 18 - 6 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 4 : Camera Tag :\n  3118 : Queue item count : 8</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 20 - 6 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID : 6 : Camera Tag :\n  3769 : Queue item count : 9</p>\n  \n  <p>Thread ID: 22 - 4 queue in QueueObject : Camera ID :8 : Camera Tag :\n  4854 : Queue item count : 10</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I should have different count number in '_queueItem' since every object created can access only one time in this segment thus letting me know that their element will be enqueued into '_queueItem'.

Here is a outline of the design used:</p>\n\n<p>First I've got a <code>JTable</code> that displays some data of an usb device, this <code>JTable</code> asks for a communication-core object that implements <code>Observer</code> (the one that reads and writes data to my device) through an <code>Observable</code> object the data it wants, the data it wants depends of which rows are displayed so it's updated when the user scrolls de table, than this communication-core object gets this notification through <code>synchronized update</code> method that calls other <code>synchronized</code> method that updates a <code>HashTable</code> which saves the last read values for after use (this communication class notifies back my <code>JTable</code> class and other objects when it reads values though other <code>Observable</code> object). The exception is occuring in this last method while updates the <code>HashTable</code>. Here is a simplification of the code:</p>\n\n<p>The following methods are of the communication-core object</p>\n\n<pre><code>public synchronized void update(Observable o, Object arg)\n{\n    // do some other work\n    // calls the second synchronized method\n    updateMonitorList();\n}\n\nprivate synchronized void updateMonitorList()\n{\n    // updates a list of monitoring addresses (no problem here)\n    // m_lastValues is the HashTable that is giving me headaches\n    Iterator&lt;Parameter&gt; itr = m_lastValues.keySet().iterator();\n    while (itr.hasNext())\n    {\n        // removes the currently not used parameters from the HashTable\n        Parameter p = itr.next(); // concurrent exception here WHY? :/\n        boolean contains = false;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_monitorList.size(); i++)\n        {\n            if (p.equals(m_monitorList.get(i)))\n            {\n                contains = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!contains)\n        {\n            m_lastValues.remove(p);\n        }\n    }\n    // more operations with the HashTable\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_monitorList.size(); i++)\n    {\n        // adds newly added parameters to the hashtable\n        boolean contains = false;\n        for (Observer key : m_requestedParameters.keySet())\n        {\n            if (key.equals(m_monitorList.get(i)))\n            {\n                contains = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!contains)\n        {\n            m_lastValues.put(m_monitorList.getAt(i), m_monitorList.getAt(i).m_intUserSetting);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// this method is used to know if a value has changed\nprivate synchronized boolean getParameterChanged(Parameter currentParamer)\n{\n    Integer v = m_lastValues.get(currentParamer);\n    return v == null || v != currentParamer.m_intUserSetting;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need this approach because I have multiple windows that asks for values from the usb device, and this communication object takes care of it, there was no problem with concurrency before I added this <code>HashTable</code> of last values. This <code>m_lastValues</code> <code>HashTable</code> is not used in any other method not listed above.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions?

As @Tudor pointed out the problem was the <code>remove()</code> method inside the <code>while</code> loop. Here is how I solved it:</p>\n\n<p>This code goes into <code>updateMonitorList()</code> method, note that <code>no Iterator was needed</code> (the first question was with a <code>for</code> loop like that), actually the <code>Iterator</code> made no difference:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ArrayList&lt;Parameter&gt; remove = new ArrayList&lt;Parameter&gt;();\n    for (Parameter p : m_lastValues.keySet())\n    {\n        boolean contains = false;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_monitorList.size(); i++)\n        {\n            if (p.equals(m_monitorList.get(i)))\n            {\n                contains = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!contains)\n        {\n            remove.add(p);\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; remove.size(); i++)\n    {\n        m_lastValues.remove(remove.get(i));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["android","multithreading","android-layout","listview"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":13174586,"title":"How to get the status of the child view of ListView?","body":"<p>I have a problem with my application.

When a message was put into the database, a random thread number (1-5) and the supplier was chosen to ensure that no message was processed twice while avoiding having to lock the table/row.

It seems to me like a resource waste to have all the scripts running and checking for messages all of the time so I am trying to work out if there is a better way to do it, or if the old way is acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts right now lie with the idea of having one script that runs and forks as many child processes as are needed (up to a limit) depending on how much traffic there is, but I am not sure how best to implement it such that each message is processed only once, while the fair queuing is maintained.</p>\n\n<p>My best guess right now is that the parent script updates the DB to indicate which child process should handle it, however I am concerned that this will end up being less efficient than the original method.

The two ways that I can accomplish this task are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use IPP without TBB</li>\n<li>Use IPP with TBB inside a parallel_for loop</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My question is that I have coded the application, and I get correct result. But surprisingly, my computational time is larger when they are combined. To avoid clutter, I only paste part of my code in here. But I can provide the whole code if needed. For the first case when I use only IPP, the code is like: (The base of the algorithm was borrowed from the Intel TBB sample code for Image resizing)</p>\n\n<pre><code>ippiResizeSqrPixel_8u_C1R(src, srcSize, srcStep, srcRoi, dst, dstStep, dstRoi, \nm_nzoom_x,m_nzoom_y,0, 0, interpolation, pBufferWhole);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the parallel_for loop looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>parallel_for(\n    blocked_range&lt;size_t&gt;(0,CHUNK),\n    [=](const blocked_range&lt;size_t&gt; &amp;r){\n        for (size_t i= r.begin(); i!= r.end(); i++){\n            ippiResizeSqrPixel_8u_C1R(src+((int)(i*srcWidth*srcHeight)), srcSize, \nsrcStep, srcRoi, dst+((int)(i*dstWidth*dstHeight)), dstStep, dstRoi, \nm_nzoom_x,m_nzoom_y,0, 0, interpolation, pBuffer);\n        }\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>src</code> and <code>dst</code> are pointers to the source image and the destination image. When TBB is used, the image is partitioned into <code>CHUNKS</code> parts and the parallel_for loops through all the <code>CHUNKS</code> and uses an IPP function to resize each CHUNK independently. The value for <code>dstHeight</code>, <code>srcHeight</code>, <code>srcRoi</code>, and <code>dstRoi</code> are modified to accommodate the partitioning of the image, and <code>src+((int)(i*srcWidth*srcHeight))</code> and <code>dst+((int)(i*dstWidth*dstHeight))</code> will point to the beginning of each partition in the source and destination image.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, IPP and TBB can be combined in this manner -- as I get the correct result -- but what baffles me is that the computational time deteriorates when they're combined compared to when IPP is used alone.

But what I've noticed is that the compression size of each block for single thread and multithread is radically different.</p>\n\n<p>In my single threaded run, I have a GZIPOutputStream(System.out, true) with SYNC_FLUSH set. I read from system.in continually until my buffer is full.</p>\n\n<pre><code>GZIPOutputStream compressor = new GZIPOutputStream(System.out, true);\nbytesRead = inBytes.read(buff,0,BLOCK_SIZE);\n....\nwhile(bytesRead != -1)\n{\n    offset += bytesRead;\n    if (offset == BLOCK_SIZE)\n    {\n        compressor.write(buff,0,offset);\n        compressor.flush();\n        offset = 0;\n    }\n\n    if((bytesRead=inBytes.read(buff,offset,BLOCK_SIZE-offset)) == -1) {\n        compressor.write(buff,0,offset);\n        compressor.finish();\n    }\n}\ncompressor.close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, after a have a full buffer, I tell compressor to write to output, and then I call flush. The assures that I force it to compress and flush out any remaining output, so when it goes to write again, it doesn't have any left over data in the buffer.</p>\n\n<p>So it's quite similar to as if your original input had been that length to begin with (so each block is it's own individual stream). </p>\n\n<p>So in my multithreaded program, instead of having one GZIPOutputStream write and flush, I just have a bunch of threads that each have their own GZIPOutputStream. So basically, replace that part with a call to a thread</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Future&lt;byte[]&gt;&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;byte[]&gt;&gt;();\nbytesRead = inBytes.read(buff,0,BLOCK_SIZE);\n\nwhile(bytesRead != -1)\n{\n    offset += bytesRead;\n    if (offset == BLOCK_SIZE)\n    {\n        results.add(exec.submit(new workerThread(buff,offset)));\n        offset = 0;\n    }\n\n    if((bytesRead=inBytes.read(buff,offset,BLOCK_SIZE-offset)) == -1) {\n        results.add(exec.submit(new workerThread(buff,offset)));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where I just pass the buffer to them to compress.

I didn't change anything else. However, when I run my multi-threaded program and hexdump the result, I noticed that each block usually differs a lot between the two programs. I used a small buffer and small input so it was more easily read.</p>\n\n<p>I get a crc error with my multithreaded program, which means at least that gzip recognizes the format and begins decompressing. It's just that when it's done, the final result doesn't match what it expected from the CRC (such as the size of the decompressed output and such).</p>\n\n<p>I'm honestly not sure why this happens. I would have expected some much more obvious error, but this one seems so random. It's definitely compressing. And the first few bytes between the single threaded and multithreaded program (after the header of course) are often the same, so I don't think I'm concatenating out of order (plus the executor.get() function should handle that).</p>\n\n<p>I'm just stumped. I know gzip can decompress concatenated streams. I literally split my input in half and output it separately then combined them in my singlethread program and it decompressed just fine.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I just tried it on a file with 328 \"A\" characters, so it's not very large.

The problem is that I have to use both multiprocessing and threading as the latter appears not to work on ARM (some fuzzy interaction of python interpreter and vim, outside of vim everything is fine) (I was using the second approach there, have not tried threading+cycle; no code is currently left) and the former spawns way too many processes which I would like not to see unless really required. This leads to a problem of having to code two different approaches while <code>threading</code> with cycle is just a few more imports for drop-in replacements of all <code>multiprocessing</code> stuff wrapped in <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> (except that there is no <code>thread.terminate()</code>).

These statuses must be updated, but updating them immediately cannot be done without using hooks and I have no idea how to set hooks temporary and remove on vim quit without possibly spoiling user configuration. Thus standard solution is cache expiring after N seconds.

At this point, I'm mostly hoping to have more eyes since I honestly can't see anything wrong with my code anymore after redoing and refining it so many times.</p>\n\n<p>We needed to write a multithreaded compressor in Java that can be decompressed correctly with the gzip -d call. We cannot use the GZIPOutputStream call. Instead, we have generate a header and trailer manually and use a Deflater to compress the data. We read from standard input and write to standard output.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I used and Executor to maintain a thread pool. I read the input as it comes in and write it into a buffer of a set size. Once the buffer is full, I pass that block of data to a thread (put a task in the queue). Each thread has it's own Deflater and is passed the input and any other information it needs to compress that data. I also use the last 32Kb of each block as a dictionary for the next block.</p>\n\n<p>I've confirmed that my header and trailer are correct. I used GZIPOutputStream to compress a file and used hexdump to get the bytes so I can compare it with my output. I've checked of files of different sizes and the header and trailer are identical, so in all likelyhood the issue is in the compressed data. The error that I get is: invalid compressed data--crc error </p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed that when I pass in an input that is relatively small (so that there is only one thread since I never fill up the buffer, there is only one task in the queue) the output is correct. I can call gzip -d on the compressed data and get back the exact same input.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the problem is in when there is enough data that more than one thread is up and running. I used a hexdump on my output for the large file and compared it with GZIPOutputStream's hexdump an they're quite similar (not exactly the same, but even the case with the small file the hexdump was also slightly different for the compressed data.

The reason being since this is not a file, there's a chance that the first call to read does not read enough bytes to fill the array (leaving me with a bunch of nulls that I don't want messing up anything). Once it is full, I give it to the Executor so the thread will execute the task. I implemented Callable instead of Runnable so that I could return the ouput as a byte array AND because I need the future interface. The exec.get() method allows me to the keep the threads synchornized. I've tested that with an arbitrary case (printing out numbers 1 - 100 to make sure, and they do indeed print in order).</p>\n\n<p>There is a flaw where this program won't work with files that are a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, but that's not even the issue I'm on right now. This program works when the input is small enough that I only run one thread.</p>\n\n<p>For each block except for the last one, I call deflate with the SYNC_FLUSH option. This is so I can end on a byte boundary. The last block I compress normally and call finish on.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the really long post.

So I use this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)\n    {\n        _timerThread.Abort();\n    }\n\n    private void Timer_Elapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        // we're on the timer thread now\n\n        try\n        {\n            RefreshUi();\n        }\n        catch (ThreadAbortException)\n        {\n            System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort();\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            MessageBox.Show(ex.ToString());\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is sometimes the ThreadAbortException is caught, and sometimes it isn't.  I find it's mostly uncaught when in the middle of executing queries.</p>\n\n<p><em>[UPDATE]</em> I've recently discovered I can catch the ThreadAbortException if I check the innerexception.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is it ok use Thread.Abort() in this case?  If so, how do I ALWAYS catch the ThreadAbortException so the user doesn't see it when closing the Form? (from what I've read I don't think this is possible)</li>\n<li>If it's not ok to use Thread.Abort() (which is what I think most of you will answer), then here are my other concerns with using a \"global boolean flag\" to tell the thread(s) when to shutdown.\n<ul>\n<li>I'm concerned the threads won't stop themselves within the 1 second time limit. (For example, I may have some queries that take 1-2 seconds to run)</li>\n<li>I will have to clutter my code with: if(shouldShutdown) statements.</li>\n<li>Should I make the shouldShutdown flag static so all my classes can use it?  Will this pose a problem if the user can open multiple dashboards at the same time? (I'm concerned about the static variable being shared across all dashboards. This I definetely don't want.)</li>\n<li>When the worker threads see they have to shutdown, should they throw an exception or just return?  If they just return, then I'll have to add even more if(shouldShutdown) checks because it's ok for some functions to return false.  If throwing an exception is ok, which exception do you recommend?  A custom one?</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","swing"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":1,"question_id":13114097,"title":"SwingUtilities.invokeLater on full speed thread","body":"<p>I have a thread that does display updates on my JFrame by using SwingUtilities.invokeLater.

Later that application is going to be tested and run on an embedded device without a keyboard in full screen.</p>\n\n<p>For easier debugging I have a custom assert macro, which allows me to ignore certain asserts (may include known buggy parts I have to work around for now) etc. For the time being I just print something on the console such as \"Assertion: XXXX failed; abort/ignore\". This is fine when I start the application within a console, but ultimately fails when I run it on the final device. In that case the assert will just block the main thread waiting for input and make the GUI hang badly without hope for recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am thinking about how to remedy this situation. One Idea is to just have the assert crash, as the standard assert does. But I do not really like that Idea, since there are a lot of know problems, and I've always found ignorable asserts very helpful when testing applications. Also I would have to put the messages into a separate file, so I can later see what happened while testing. Reading these files afterwards is possible, but I would prefer a simpler way to find out what went wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The other idea was to make a window instead. However the asserts may be triggered in any thread and I can only create new windows in the GUI thread. Also the main event loop may be blocked by the assert, so I cannot be sure that it will handle the events correctly. I would somehow need a fully responsive stand-alone window in a separate thread, which only handles a few buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Is this somehow possible in QT4?</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","multithreading","pygtk"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":1,"question_id":13122984,"title":"Python&PyGTK: Transport data to threading","body":"<p>I would like to transfer data to threading class, but I can't get what is wrong.

It doesn't seem to be able to receive the results of a task started before an activity was restarted after the activity restarts.</li>\n<li>All the task parameters seem to have to be <code>Parcelable</code> or <code>Serialiazable</code> to go into a <code>Bundle</code> object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Handler, Threads, with Messages</h2>\n\n<p>This is the method I settled on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to implement, extremely customizable.</li>\n<li>You get access to the thread executing the task: set priority, set thread name for debugging, set daemon, and etc.</li>\n<li>Seems much more responsive than with using AsyncTasks, based on an eye test where I click a button a lot of times and watch the results and threads flash by ;) I could benchmark this.</li>\n<li>To handle life cycle issues, can write a singleton class that manages messages (persists while the process is alive). Stores them when a given activity's handler is not set up, then forwards them to the activity handler if it asks for its missed messages. Meaning a task doesn't have to restart with the same parameters, which can be critical for tasks that are non-idempotent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So I came to the conclusion that using <code>Handler</code>, <code>Threads</code>, and <code>Messages</code> is a much better solution, but I'm convinced I'm missing something because nearly everywhere I looked the recommendation was to use the <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code> method.

It shows that creating Haskell threads in an order of magnitude faster.</p>\n\n<p>Now, my question is: is this a correct benchmark? or is there some factor that I need to take into account to get accurate results?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","image","graphics","awt"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":13114317,"title":"Java won't draw my image when method is called using threads","body":"<p>I have this flower program where it is supposed to drop flowers from above....

I also tried to promote data model modification to main thread, which means once data structure is changed, it emits a signal to controller, then the slot function in controller modifies the data model. This crashes too. plus this design looks weird. data structure changes model directly seems a better design, but it will keep model in working thread.

It consists of 2 modules, a psuedo-server and a psuedo-client, however my design has lead me to believe that I'm trying to implement an impossible concept.  </p>\n\n<h2>The Server</h2>\n\n<p>The server waits on localhost port 4000 for a connection, and when it receives one, it starts 2 threads, a listener thread and a speaker thread.  The speaker thread constantly waits for user input to the console, and sends it to the client when it receives said input.  The listener thread blocks to the ObjectInputStream of the socket for any messages sent by the client, and then prints the message to the console.</p>\n\n<h2>The Client</h2>\n\n<p>The client connects the user to the server on port 4000, and then starts 2 threads, a listener and s speaker.  These threads have the same functionality as the server's threads, but, for obvious reasons, handle input/output in the opposite way.</p>\n\n<h2>The First Problem</h2>\n\n<p>The problem I am running into is that in order to end the chat, a user must type \"Bye\".  Now, since my threads have been looped to block for input:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    while(connected()){\n\n        //block for input\n        //do something with this input\n        //determine if the connection still exists (was the message \"Bye\"?)\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then it becomes a really interesting scenario when trying to exit the application.  If the client types \"Bye\", then it returns the sending thread and the thread that listened for the \"Bye\" on the server also returns.  This leaves us with the problem that the client-side listener and the server-side speaker do not know that \"Bye\" has been typed, and thus continue execution.  </p>\n\n<p>I resolved this issue by creating a class Synchronizer that holds a boolean variable that both threads access in a synchronized manner:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Synchronizer {\n\n    boolean chatting;\n\n    public Synchronizer(){\n\n        chatting = true;\n        onChatStatusChanged();\n    }\n\n    synchronized void stopChatting(){\n\n        chatting = false;\n        onChatStatusChanged();\n    }\n\n    synchronized boolean chatting(){\n\n        return chatting;\n    }\n\n    public void onChatStatusChanged(){\n\n     System.out.println(\"Chat status changed!: \" + chatting);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then passed the same instance of this class into the thread as it was created.  There was still one issue though.</p>\n\n<h2>The Second Problem</h2>\n\n<p>This is where I deduced that what I am trying to do is impossible using the methods I am currently employing.  Given that one user has to type \"Bye\" to exit the chat, the other 2 threads that aren't being utilized still go on to pass the check for a connection and begin blocking for I/O.  While they are blocking, the original 2 threads realize that the connection has been terminated, but even though they change the boolean value, the other 2 threads have <strong>already</strong> passed the check, and are already blocking for I/O.  </p>\n\n<p>This means that even though you will terminate the thread on the next iteration of the loop, you will still be trying to receive input from the other threads that have been properly terminated.  This lead me to my final conclusion and question.</p>\n\n<h2>My Question</h2>\n\n<p>Is it possible to asynchronously receive and send data in the manner which I am trying to do?  (2 threads per client/server that both block for I/O)  Or must I send a heartbeat every few milliseconds back and forth between the server and client that requests for any new data and use this heartbeat to determine a disconnect?</p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to reside in the fact that my threads are blocking for I/O before they realize that the partner thread has disconnected.  This leads to the main issue, how would you then asynchronously stop a thread blocking for I/O?</p>\n\n<p>I feel as though this is something that should be able to be done as the behavior is seen throughout social media.</p>\n\n<p>Any clarification or advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","multithreading"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":1,"question_id":13111594,"title":"I want run a function without hanging program for second","body":"<p>when i run </p>\n\n<pre><code>msgcheck.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            \n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n\n            if(msgcheck.isChecked()){\n                //hedearMsg\n\n\n                final Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this);\n                dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);\n                dialog.getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(android.graphics.Color.TRANSPARENT));\n                dialog.setContentView(R.layout.custommsg);\n                dialog.setCancelable(true);\n                dialog.show();\n\n                Thread t = new Thread() {\n                  public void run() {\n                     // Do something on another thread\n                      PopulatePeopleList();\n\n                  }\n                };\n                t.run();\n\n        }\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>my program hang a few second and then show dialog<br>\ni want run this dialog without hanging and PopulatePeopleListfunc work anyone idea?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c","arrays","multithreading","pthreads"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":13111816,"title":"Array of threads in C","body":"<p>I am trying to do a consumer / producer program with multiple consumers and producers.

I have a byte array holding deflated data written into it using a Deflater:</p>\n\n<pre><code>deflate(outData, 0, BLOCK_SIZE, SYNC_FLUSH)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason I didn't just use GZIPOutputStream was because there were 4 threads (variable) that each were given a block of data and each thread compressed it's own block before storing that compressed data into a global byte array. If I used GZIPOutputStream it messes up the format because each little block has a header and trailer and is it's own gzip data (I only want to compress it).</p>\n\n<p>So in the end, I've got this byteArray, outData, that's holding all of my compressed data but I'm not really sure how to wrap it.

It's already compressed and I'm just hitting a wall trying to figure out how to get it into a form. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Ok, bad wording on my part. I'm writing it to output, not a file, so that it could be redirected if needed. A really simple example is that </p>\n\n<pre><code>cat file.txt | java Jzip | gzip -d | cmp file.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>should return 0. The problem right now is if I write this byte array as is to output, it's just \"raw\" compressed data. I think gzip needs all this extra information. </p>\n\n<p>If there's an alternative method, that would be fine to. The whole reason it's like this is because I needed to use multiple threads. Otherwise I would just call GZIPOutputStream.</p>\n\n<p>DOUBLE EDIT: Since the comments provide a lot of good insight, another method is that I just have a bunch of uncompressed blocks of data that were originally one long stream. If gzip can read concatenated streams, if I took those blocks (and kept them in order) and gave each one to a thread that calls GZIPOutputStream on its own block, then took the results and concatenated them. In essence, each block now has header, the compressed info, and trailer. Would gzip recognize that if I concatenated them?</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>cat file.txt\nHello world! How are you? I'm ready to set fire to this assignment.\n\njava Testcase &lt; file.txt &gt; file.txt.gz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I accept it from input. Inside the program, the stream is split up into\n\"Hello world!\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm ready to set fire to this assignment\" (they're not strings, it's just an array of bytes! this is just illustration)</p>\n\n<p>So I've got these three blocks of bytes, all uncompressed. I give each of these blocks to a thread, which uses</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class DGZIPOutputStream extends GZIPOutputStream\n{\n    public DGZIPOutputStream(OutputStream out, boolean flush) throws IOException\n    {\n        super(out, flush);\n    }\n    public void setDictionary(byte[] b)\n    {\n        def.setDictionary(b);\n    }\n    public void updateCRC(byte[] input)\n    {\n        crc.update(input);\n    }                       \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the only thing here is that I've set the flush to SYNC_FLUSH so I can get the alignment right and have the ability to set the dictionary. If each thread were to use DGZIPOutputStream (which I've tested and it works for one long continuous input), and I concatenated those three blocks (now compressed each with a header and trailer), would gzip -d file.txt.gz work?</p>\n\n<p>If that's too weird, ignore the dictionary completely. It doesn't really matter. I just added it in while I was at it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","multithreading","progress-bar","backgroundworker","invokerequired"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":98,"score":1,"question_id":12533412,"title":"Multithreading for a progressbar and code locations (vb.net)?","body":"<p>I am stuck updating a progressbar from a different thread.\nI did get it running in the simplest way, but then cleaning the code gets me stuck.</p>\n\n<p>My testing code looks like all the examples on the web related to backgroundworker and BeginInvoke.</p>\n\n<p>FormP is the Progressbar-Form.\nThis works:</p>\n\n<p><code>\nPublic Class Form1</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Delegate Sub delegate_ProgressUpdate(ByVal paramValue As Integer, ByVal paramMax As Integer)\n\nPrivate Sub Button1_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    ' Test 01:\n    ' Show Progressbar via BGW\n    ' All functions are within Form1\n    Dim bgw As New BackgroundWorker()\n    AddHandler bgw.DoWork, AddressOf BGW_Sample01_DoWork\n\n    FormP.Show(Me)\n    bgw.RunWorkerAsync()\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub invokeMe_ProgressUpdate(ByVal paramValue As Integer, ByVal paramMax As Integer)\n    FormP.ProgressBar1.Maximum = paramMax\n    FormP.ProgressBar1.Value = paramValue\n    FormP.ProgressBar1.Update()\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub BGW_Sample01_DoWork(sender As Object, e As System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs)\n    For i As Integer = 1 To 10\n        Threading.Thread.Sleep(500) ' Test delay\n        Me.BeginInvoke(New delegate_ProgressUpdate(AddressOf invokeMe_ProgressUpdate),\n                       i, 10)\n    Next\n    MessageBox.Show(\"Fertig\")\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></code></p>\n\n<p>If I try to make things work more orderly encapsulated in FormP, it doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p><code>\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click\n    Dim bgw As New BackgroundWorker\n    AddHandler bgw.DoWork, AddressOf BGW_Sample02_DoWork\n    FormP.Show(Me)\n    bgw.RunWorkerAsync()\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub BGW_Sample02_DoWork(sender As Object, e As System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs)\n    For i As Integer = 1 To 10\n        Threading.Thread.Sleep(500)\n        FormP.SetProgress(i, 10)\n    Next\n    MessageBox.Show(\"Fertig\")\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>' ########## FormP #################</p>\n\n<p>Public Class FormP</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Delegate Sub delegate_ProgressUpdate(ByVal value As Integer, ByVal maximum As Integer)\n\nPublic Sub SetProgress(ByVal paramValue As Integer, ByVal paramMaximum As Integer)\n    If Me.InvokeRequired Then\n        Me.Invoke(New delegate_ProgressUpdate(AddressOf Me.SetProgress), paramValue, paramMaximum)\n    Else\n        Me.ProgressBar1.Maximum = paramMaximum\n        Me.ProgressBar1.Value = paramValue\n        Me.ProgressBar1.Update()\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>End Class\n</code></p>\n\n<p>FormP does not freeze, but UI is not updated.\nActually Me.InvokeRequired is false and I think that's where I begin to miss some important parts.\nI tried Form1.InvokeRequired here, but it's false as well.\nMy understanding is: the calling thread here is the bgw thread, no matter in what class the code is that this thread calls...\nThat seems not to be it?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Michael</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","multithreading","backgroundworker"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":13106373,"title":"accessing datatable and variables inside Backgroundworker","body":"<p>in my program i use a Datatable which is filled at loading of form.

As I read, I split the input into blocks of a set size. Each one of these blocks is given to a thread (along with some other information) so that they can compress it. As such, I don't know how many threads I'll need to create as I need to keep going until I reach the end of the input. I also have to somehow ensure that the data stays in the same order.

I can't just say worker = new WorkerThread a bunch of time since isn't it already pointing towards an existing thread (true, a thread that might be dead) and obviously in this implemenation if it did work I wouldn't be running in parallel.

I have to read something between 3 and 99 files and add their hashes to a string[] which I want to add to a list of all files with their respective hashes. Afterwards I have to compare the items on that list to a database (which comes in text files).\nOnce all that is done, I have to update a textbox in the main form and the progressbar to 33%; mostly I just don't want the main form to freeze during processing.</p>\n\n<p>The files I'm working with always sum up to 1.2GB (+/- a few MB), meaning I should be able to read them into byte[]s and process them from there (I have to calculate CRC32, MD5 and SHA1 of each of those files so that should be faster than reading all of them from a HDD 3 times).</p>\n\n<p>Also I should note that some files may be 1MB while another one may be 1GB. I initially wanted to create 99 threads for 99 files but that seems not wise, I suppose it would be best to reuse threads of small files while bigger file threads are still running. But that sounds pretty complicated to me so I'm not sure if that's wise either.</p>\n\n<p>So far I've tried workerThreads and backgroundWorkers but neither seem to work too well for me; at least the backgroundWorkers worked SOME of the time, but I can't even figure out why they won't the other times... either way the main form still froze.\nNow I've read about the Task Parallel Library in .NET 4.0 but I thought I should better ask someone who knows what he's doing before wasting more time on this.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do looks something like this (without threading):</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;string[]&gt; fileSpecifics = new List&lt;string[]&gt;();\n\nint fileMaxNumber = 42; // something between 3 and 99, depending on file set\n\nfor (int i = 1; i &lt;= fileMaxNumber; i++)\n{\n    string fileName = \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file\" + i.ToString(\"D2\") + \".ext\"; // file01.ext - file99.ext\n    string fileSize = new FileInfo(fileName).Length.ToString();\n    byte[] file = File.ReadAllBytes(fileName);\n    // hash calculations (using SHA1CryptoServiceProvider() etc., no problems with that so I'll spare you that, return strings)\n    file = null; // I didn't yet check if this made any actual difference but I figured it couldn't hurt\n    fileSpecifics.Add(new string[] { fileName, fileSize, fileCRC, fileMD5, fileSHA1 });\n}\n\n// look for files in text database mentioned above, i.e. first check for \"file bundles\" with the same amount of files I have here; then compare file sizes, then hashes\n// again, no problems with that so I'll spare you that; the database text files are pretty small so parsing them doesn't need to be done in an extra thread.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would anybody be kind enough to point me in the right direction?

But it was taking a long time, so I decided to put it in a BackgroundWorker. The code was normally editing the UI and when I changed the thread there came the problem of editing the controls in the UI thread. So what I did was to make the method report it's state, and change the UI in ProgressChanged event. To report the progress, this method takes one object named \"userState\", but for my purposes, I had to report more than one object. So I chose to do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        // Create a dictionary to keep method state for reporting.\n        // \"state\" item represents a state type; \"error\", \"update\", \"success\".\n        // \"message\"d item represents the message associated with the state.\n        // \"result\" item represents the function result.\n        // \"invisiblecolumns\" item represents the invisible columns this method finds.\n        var methodState = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; { { \"state\", \"update\" }, { \"message\", string.Empty }, \n                                                           { \"result\", null }, { \"invisiblecolumns\", null } };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I'm not sure if this is a good way to do it.

I create an instance of this class and pass it to the main thread so the data can be displayed.  The code in the main thread looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    // Delegate for the Invoke call, \n    // make it static to prevent a problem with garbage collection\n    delegate void GetFrameDelegate(DataFrameInfo frameInfo);\n    private static GetFrameDelegate d;\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Did we just receive a frame?\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    /// &lt;param name=\"source\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;\n    /// &lt;param name=\"args\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;\n    void frameGrabbed(object source, DataFrameInfo args)\n    {\n        if (this.InvokeRequired)\n        {\n            // It's on a different thread, so use Invoke.\n            d = new GetFrameDelegate(GetFrame);\n            this.Invoke(d, new object[] { args });\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Get the Frame\n        GetFrame(args);\n    }\n\n    private void GetFrame(DataFrameInfo frameInfo)\n    {\n        // Call Display Frame\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Frame: The bufferIndex is \" + frameInfo.BufferIndex);\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Frame: The number is \" + frameInfo.FrameNumber);\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Frame: The timestamp is \" + frameInfo.FrameTimestamp / 1000);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The FrameGrabbedEvent is connected to the frameGrabbed() function.

It seemed like the solution most suggested was to make the delegate static, but that's not working for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sounds like I missed some relevant code.  Below is the code that causes the frameGrabbed event.

While processing these jobs, new work may be added, which then needs to be processed as well. The <code>Parallel.For</code> solution would look as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var jobs = new List&lt;Job&gt; { firstJob };\nint startIdx = 0, endIdx = jobs.Count;\nwhile (startIdx &lt; endIdx) {\n  Parallel.For(startIdx, endIdx, i =&gt; WorkJob(jobs[i]));\n  startIdx = endIdx; endIdx = jobs.Count;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This means that there are multiple times where the Parallel.For needs to synchronize. Consider a bread-first graph algorithm algorithm; the number of synchronizations would be quite large. Waste of time, no?</p>\n\n<p>Trying the same in the old-fashioned threading approach:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var queue = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;Job&gt; { firstJob };\nvar threads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();\nvar waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent(false);\nint numBusy = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; maxThreads; i++) \n  threads.Add(new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate {\n    while (!queue.IsEmpty || numBusy &gt; 0) {\n      if (queue.IsEmpty)\n        // numbusy &gt; 0 implies more data may arrive\n        waitHandle.WaitOne();\n\n      Job job;\n      if (queue.TryDequeue(out job)) {\n        Interlocked.Increment(ref numBusy);\n        WorkJob(job); // WorkJob does a waitHandle.Set() when more work was found\n        Interlocked.Decrement(ref numBusy);\n      }\n    }\n    // others are possibly waiting for us to enable more work which won't happen\n    waitHandle.Set(); \n})));\nthreads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.Start());\nthreads.ForEach(t =&gt; t.Join());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>Parallel.For</code> code is of course much cleaner, but what I cannot comprehend, it's even faster as well!

Essentially there's a generic class <code>Retriever&lt;T&gt;</code> and it maintains a queue of URIs to be retrieved. It has a separate thread that handles that queue as fast as it can. An example of a type of URI, as indicated in the question title, is HTTP type URIs.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, when I get down to requesting that the resource be retrieved, via an abstract method <code>T RetrieveResource(Uri location)</code>, it slow down due to a lack of asynchrony.</p>\n\n<p>Changing the return type of <code>RetrieveResource</code> to <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> was my first thought. However, that seems to make tasks pile up and cause lots of problems when we have thousands of outstanding tasks. It appears to create many actual threads instead of utilizing the thread pool. I imagine this just slows everything down because there are too many things going on at once, so nothing individually is making significant progress.</p>\n\n<p>It's expected that we will have a large number of queued items to retrieve and that they cannot be handled as fast as they are enqueued. There is an opportunity for the system to catch up, over time; but it's definitely not quick.</p>\n\n<p>I've also thought about instead of maintaining a queue and a thread to handle it... to just queue a work item on the <code>ThreadPool</code>.

If another thread were to come in at the same time, and say, remove all elements from \"list\" the iterator would not see that, it would go to set the \"list\" at a given index and would throw an exception because the element at that point no longer exists.

At first I tried to tune database connection pool (commons-dbcp and later tomcat-jdbc) but result was the same.

Thus the problem is in HTTP connections handling.</p>\n\n<p>After some searching (and googling, of course) I found out that Spring WS comes with the default connection manager(SimpleHttpConnectionManager) which is single threaded.

My question is how can I force the test thread to switch to and from the UI thread so that way the task can be executed?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Vince</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","multithreading","locking"],"answer_count":11,"favorite_count":15,"up_vote_count":25,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":21951,"score":25,"question_id":244316,"title":"Reader/Writer Locks in C++","body":"<p>I'm looking for a good reader/writer lock in C++.

It is worth noticing that the order of processing the nodes in the queue is unimportant. Note also that some points may request a tortuous ascendant path to be reached from the border. Think for example to a cone with a furrow spiraling around it. The ridge of the furrow is such a unique and tortuous path capable of reaching the top of the cone without never descending into the furrow.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I want to mutithread this algorithm. I am still in the first step of wondering which is the best organization of data and threads in order to have as least pain as possible at debugging the beast when it is written.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought is to divide the grid into tiles and split the Queue in as many tiles as there is in the grid. The tiles are piled in a work-list. A few threads are parsing the work-list and grab any tile where something can be done at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Working on a specific tile will firstly need that the tile's queue is not empty. I may also need that the neighboring tiles can be locked if the walker's tile has to visit a node at the edge of the tile.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking that when a walker cannot lock a neighboring tile while it needs to, then it can skip to the next node in the local queue, or even the thread itself can release the tile to the work-list and seek for another tile to work on.</p>\n\n<p>My actual experience of multi-thread programming is good enough to understand that this lovely description is very likely to turn into a nightmare when I will debug it. However I am not experienced enough to evaluate the various possibilities of programming the algorithm and make a good decision, having in mind that I will not be given a month to debug a spaghetti dish. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading","communication"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":3,"view_count":45,"score":-2,"question_id":13028363,"title":"vb.net client multithreaded to server communication","body":"<p>My first post here, great site!\nI wanted to share a my experience with vb.net (vs2010 express :) ) in creating a client / server program that uses multiple threads on the client side.</p>\n\n<p>what is the issue there? if not using syncLock on client side in the send/receive part you could see that the response back from the server is mixed up with other thread communications.</p>\n\n<p>Create 2 seperate projects. 1 for the client and the other for the server.</p>\n\n<p>Execute the server side.\nExecute the client side.</p>\n\n<p>The client runs in a loop until you write \"bye\" in the console line.\nOn each keyboard click that you press it will create 4 threads and send the thread Id to the server.

I call an url with a parameter, and in return I get a small string with the result of the lookup. Simple enough.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge is however, that I have to do lots of these lookups (a couple of thousands), and I would like to limit the time needed. Therefore I would like to run requests in parallel (say 10-20). I use a ThreadPool to do this, and the short version of my code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void startAsyncLookup(Action&lt;LookupResult&gt; returnLookupResult)\n{\n this.returnLookupResult = returnLookupResult;\n\n foreach (string number in numbersToLookup)\n {\n  ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(lookupNumber, number);\n }\n}\n\npublic void lookupNumber(Object threadContext)\n{\n string numberToLookup = (string)threadContext;\n string url = @\"http://some.url.com/?number=\" + numberToLookup;\n\n WebClient webClient = new WebClient();\n Stream responseData = webClient.OpenRead(url);\n\n LookupResult lookupResult = parseLookupResult(responseData);\n returnLookupResult(lookupResult);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I fill up <code>numbersToLookup</code> (a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>) from another place, call <code>startAsyncLookup</code> and provide it with a call-back function <code>returnLookupResult</code> to return each result. This works, but I found that I'm not getting the throughput I want.</p>\n\n<p>Initially I thought it might be the 3rd party having a poor system on their end, but I excluded this by trying to run the same code from two different machines at the same time. Each of the two took as long as one did alone, so I could rule out that one.</p>\n\n<p>A colleague then tipped me that this might be a limitation in Windows. I googled a bit, and found amongst others <a href=\"http://www.pctools.com/guides/registry/detail/536/\">this post</a> saying that by default Windows limits the number of simultaneous request to the same web server to 4 for HTTP 1.0 and to 2 for HTTP 1.1 (for HTTP 1.1 this is actually according to the specification (RFC2068)).</p>\n\n<p>The same post referred to above also provided a way to increase these limits. By adding two registry values to <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings]</code> (MaxConnectionsPerServer and MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server), I could control this myself.</p>\n\n<p>So, I tried this (sat both to 20), restarted my computer, and tried to run my program again. Sadly though, it didn't seem to help any. I also kept an eye on the Resource Monitor (<a href=\"http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2306/resourcemonitor.jpg\">see screen shot</a>) while running my batch lookup, and I noticed that my application (the one with the title blacked out) still only was using two TCP connections.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question is, why isn't this working? Is the post I linked to using the wrong registry values? Is this perhaps not possible to \"hack\" in Windows any longer (I'm on Windows 7)?</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be highly appreciated :)</p>\n\n<p>And just in case anyone should wonder, I have also tried with different settings for MaxThreads on ThreadPool (everyting from 10 to 100), and this didn't seem to affect my throughput at all, so the problem shouldn't be there either.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","windows","multithreading","python-3.x"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":195,"score":2,"question_id":6244401,"title":"Are there any reasons not to mix Multiprocessing and Threading module in Python","body":"<p>I am considering using Python to implement a program, which requires extensive multi-threading.

The animation is just skipped and the view switch is made straight.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why ? My guess would be it's a thread issue or something like this but I'm clueless about these stuffs.

Can some one please help me in doing this and if possible provide me some good coding examples?\nThanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["vb.net","multithreading","stream","webclient"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":1,"question_id":12993110,"title":"VB.NET Application Freezed and not running","body":"<p>I have an application that uses a loop to call a new thread with some parameters, the application is great but when it comes to 100,000 records or so the application is not running (in the CPU and memory taskmgr not change, therefore assume that the program is not working)</p>\n\n<p>The action is:\nIt runs a function that first collects a number (X) and then create a loop from 0 to X, within this loop we create a new Thread and options as indicated IsBackground (True), Priority (Normal), and initialize the thread.\nIn the same function Thread.Join have a Do While (true) and if you can cross it refreshed interface, abort thread, memory clean and DoEvents!</p>\n\n<p>Within the thread use a WebClient to OpenRead and keep all this in a Stream.\nWith WebClient.IsBusy = False Do While we ensure that the information is downloaded and proceed to make a MatchCollection with Regex.Match.\nUsing a For Each the match and print results, and ended Exit Do.</p>\n\n<p>Then returns to the function that tells a while back ...</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought it was because of the number of results that were printed in the listbox but I got it and still fails, not when it reaches the 100,000 records if not the 100,800 or so.</p>\n\n<p>I need help, I don't know very well programming in vb.net and not understand why.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI tried remove the For Each of thread, check whether it was.\nIt has emerged completely, but I do not understand why it happens not even give me an error when \"For Each\" in the thread ¿solutions?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI found the bug, but i don't understand i explain:</p>\n\n<p>A) --> Initialize function with For 0 to 4500, i call a thread with parameters and receive 50 results, ( 225000 registers &lt;- 4500 * 50 ) when the principal For arrive to ~ 4000, in MatchCollection in Thread ¿fails? i don't receive the info of Regex.Matches and then freezed.</p>\n\n<p>B) --> Initialize function with For 4000 to 4500, i call a thread with parameters and receive 50 results, ( 225000 registers &lt;- 4500 * 50 ), nothing more begin the first thread (  remember now begin with 4000 to 4500 and i have receive a 25000 registers ) the program is freezed and i check with break points and fails the variable containing the results of Regex.Matches and attempting looping the that array the program are freezed!</p>\n\n<p>¿Why? ¿Solutions?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Function 1 (Inicialize Thread)</p>\n\n<p>Function 1 -></p>\n\n<pre><code>For Me.d = 0 To Pages(0) ' &lt;-- 4500\nDim param(1) As Object\nparam(0) = \"name\"\nparam(1) = \"url/\" &amp; d\nDim thread As New Thread(AddressOf Thread_)\nthread.IsBackground = True\nthread.Name = \"name\"\nthread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Normal 'ThreadPriority.Lowest\nthread.Start(param)\nDo While thread.Join(True)\nthread = Nothing\nClearMemory()\nApplication.DoEvents()\nExit Do\nLoop\nNext d\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Thread function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Public Sub Thread_(ByVal param As Object)\nTry\nIf param(0) = \"name\" Then\nUsing Client As New WebClient\nClient.Headers(\"User-Agent\") = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1290.1 Safari/537.13\"\nDim html As Stream = Client.OpenRead(param(1))\nUsing reader As New StreamReader(html)\nDo While wc.IsBusy = False\nDim ReadStr = reader.ReadToEnd\nlinks = Regex.Matches(ReadStr, \"coderegex\", RegexOptions.Compiled + RegexOptions.RightToLeft + RegexOptions.Multiline + RegexOptions.Singleline)\nFor Each match In links \nRegistres(0) = Registres(0) + 1\nDebug.Print(\"Registro: \" &amp; Registres(0) &amp; \" pág:\" &amp; PagesComplete(0))\nNext\nPagesComplete(0) = PagesComplete(0) + 1\nlinks = Nothing\nClient.Dispose()\nExit Do\nLoop\nEnd Using\nEnd Using\nEnd If\nCatch ex As Exception\nDebug.Print(\"Error \" &amp; ex.Message)\nEnd Try\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["multithreading"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"view_count":38,"score":-4,"question_id":13000214,"title":"Multithreading speedup","body":"<p>The latter 40% of a program supports multiple threads.

The main method gets called to perform the operation when the\n  NSOperationQueue schedules it to run. NSOperation classes written in\n  this way are known as non-concurrent operations, because the developer\n  is not responsible for spawning threads—multi-threading is all handled\n  by the super class. <strong>(Don’t be confused by the terminology: just\n  because an operation is non-concurrent, does not mean it cannot be\n  executed concurrently, it simply means that you don't have to handle\n  the concurrency yourself.)</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If you need more control over threading and the run-time environment\n  of your operations, you can make use of concurrent operations. To do\n  this, you subclass NSOperation and override the start method. In the\n  start method, you can spawn threads and setup the environment before\n  calling the main method. You are also required to maintain the state\n  of the NSOperation by setting properties like isExecuting and\n  isFinished. In short, concurrent operations give you a lot more\n  control, but also demand more effort—for most tasks non-concurrent\n  operations suffice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":["android","multithreading","android-asynctask"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":2,"question_id":12993098,"title":"Multiple downloads using asynctask","body":"<p>For my app (supporting Android 2.2+) I have to check HTML-code of a lot (approx 700) of different web-pages and retrieve a single name from each web-page.

Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Some_GUI_class\n{\npublic:\n    std::string thread_message;\n\nprivate:\n    Worker_class* worker;\n\n    void start_worker()\n    {\n        if (worker != NULL) return;\n\n        worker = new Worker_class(this);\n        worker-&gt;sig_message.connect(sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;Some_GUI_class::display_message_from_thread);\n        worker.start();\n    }        \n\n    void display_message_from_thread()\n    {\n        some_label-&gt;set_text(thread_message);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Worker_class\n{\npublic:\n    Worker_class(Some_GUI_class* gui_class) : gui_class(gui_class)\n    {}\n\n    void start()\n    {\n        thread = Glib::Thread::create(sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;Worker_class::run), true);\n    }\n\n    Glib::Dispather sig_message;\n\nprotected:\n    Glib::Thread* thread;\n    Glib::Mutex mutex;\n\n    Some_GUI_class* gui_class;\n\n    void run()\n    {\n        // ...\n        gui_class-&gt;thread_message = \"Message from a thread!\";\n        sig_message();                \n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This essentialy works, but I guess if the GUI thread wanted to modify thread_message at the same time there would be a problem? Is it safe to do it like this then as long as I'm sure the variables are only modified by a single thread or is there a better way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","winforms","multithreading","invoke"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":92,"score":0,"question_id":12956288,"title":"Avoiding `ObjectDisposedException` while calling `Invoke`","body":"<p>I have 2 forms, one is <code>MainForm</code> and second is <code>DebugForm</code>.

I have written a WCF service which calls into one of our vendor's code bases to perform operations, such as Login, Logout, etc. A requirement of this operation is that we have a background thread to receive events as a result of that action. For example, the Login action is sent on the main thread. Then, several events are received back from the vendor service as a result of the login. There can be 1, 2, or several events received. The background thread, which runs on a timer, receives these events and fires an event in the wcf service to notify that a new event has arrived.</p>\n\n<p>I have implemented the WCF service in Duplex mode, and planned to use callbacks to notify the UI that events have arrived. Here is my question: How do I send new events from the background thread to the thread which is executing the service? </p>\n\n<p>Right now, when I call <code>OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel&lt;IMyCallback&gt;()</code>, the OperationContext is null.

Basically, what i think it boils down to is: how do i make sure that the tasks in the UI thread dont start to run before my async task has finished.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends MapActivity {\nmyJSONmap;\n\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\nnew AsyncStuff().execute();\nlocatePlace(myJSONmap);\n\n class AsyncStuff extends AsyncTask&lt;Void, Integer, JSONObject&gt; {\n            @Override\n            protected JSONObject doInBackground(Void... params) {\n                jObject = GooglePlacesStuff.getTheJSON(formatedURL);\n                return null;\n            }\n            @Override\n            protected void onPostExecute(JSONObject result) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n                super.onPostExecute(result);\n                myJSONmap = JSONextractor.getJSONHMArrayL(jObject);  // getting the parsed data from the JSON object.\n                //the arraylist contains a hashmap of all the relevant data from the google website.\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c","windows","multithreading","mingw","posix"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":1,"question_id":12962666,"title":"Multithreading libraries not detected","body":"<p>This is a simple code which I have written to learn multi threaded programming on a Windows 7 OS in eclipse.</p>\n\n<pre><code>pthread_mutex_t double_release_001_glb_mutex_;\npthread_mutex_t * double_release_001_glb_mutex = &amp; double_release_001_glb_mutex_;\n\nvoid double_release_001_glb_mutex_lock () {}\nvoid double_release_001_glb_mutex_unlock () {}\n\nint double_release_001_glb_data = 0;\n\nvoid * double_release_001_tsk_001 (void * pram)\n{\n\n    pthread_mutex_lock (double_release_001_glb_mutex);\n    double_release_001_glb_data = (double_release_001_glb_data% 100) + 1;\n\n    pthread_mutex_unlock (double_release_001_glb_mutex);\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid double_release_001 ()\n{\n    pthread_t tid1;\n    pthread_mutex_init (double_release_001_glb_mutex, NULL);\n    pthread_create (&amp; tid1, NULL, double_release_001_tsk_001, NULL);\n    pthread_join (tid1, NULL);\n    pthread_mutex_destroy (double_release_001_glb_mutex);\n}\n\nvoid double_release_001_tskentry_001 ()\n{\n    while (1)\n    {\n        if (rand ())\n        {\n            double_release_001_tsk_001 (NULL);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But when I build it I get an error saying</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>Description Resource    Path    Location    Type\nundefined reference to `_imp__pthread_create'   \nundefined reference to `_imp__pthread_create'       \nundefined reference to `_imp__pthread_create'   \nundefined reference to `_imp__pthread_create'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have included <code>pthread.h</code>.

The contents of some of the entries is stored in a MySQL database. I am trying to speed this up using multithreading, but up to now this only slows things down.</p>\n\n<p>I parse a CSV file (up to 10GB), and some of these records (aprox. 5M out of a 20M+ record CSV) need to be inserted into a MySQL database. To determine which record needs to be inserted we use a Redis server with sets that contain the correct id's / references.</p>\n\n<p>Since we process around 30 of these files at any given time, and there are some dependencies, we store each file on a Resque queue and have multiple servers handling these (prioritized) queues.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Worker\n  def self.perform(file)\n    CsvParser.each(file) do |line|\n      next unless check_line_with_redis(line)\n      a = ObjectA.find_or_initialize_by_reference(line[:reference])\n      a.object_bs.destroy_all\n      a.update_attributes(line)\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works, scales nice horizontally (more CSV files = more servers), but larger CSV files pose a problem. We currently have files that take over 75 hours to parse this way. There are a number of optimizations I thought of already:</p>\n\n<p>One is cutting down on the MySQL queries; we instantiate AR objects while an insert with plain SQL, if we know the objects Id, is much faster. This way we can probably get rid of most of AR and maybe even Rails to remove overhead this way. We can't use a plain MySQL load data since we have to map the CSVs records to other entities that might have different Ids by now (we combine a dozen legacy databases into a new database).</p>\n\n<p>The other is trying to do more in the same time. There is some IO wait time, network wait time for both Redis and MySQL, and even while MRI uses green threads this might allow us to schedule our MySQL queries at the same time as the IO reads etc. But using the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Worker\n  def self.perform(file)\n    CsvParser.each(file) do |line|\n      next unless check_line_with_redis(line)\n      create_or_join_thread(line) do |myLine|\n        a = ObjectA.find_or_initialize_by_reference(myLine[:reference])\n        a.object_bs.destroy_all\n        a.update_attributes(myLine)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def self.create_or_join_thread(line)\n      @thread.join if @thread.present?\n      @thread = Thread.new(line) do |myLine|\n        yield myLine\n      end\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This slowly slows down the process. When I <code>ps au</code> it starts off at 100% CPU, but as time progresses it goes down to just 2-3%. At that moment it does not insert new records at all, it just appears to hang.</p>\n\n<p>I have <code>strace</code>d the process, and at first I see MySQL queries pass by, after a while it appears it is not executing my ruby code at all. Could be a deadlock (it hung after parsing the <em>last</em> line of the CSV, but the process kept on running at 5% CPU and did not quit), or something I read here: <a href=\"http://timetobleed.com/ruby-threading-bugfix-small-fix-goes-a-long-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://timetobleed.com/ruby-threading-bugfix-small-fix-goes-a-long-way/</a></p>\n\n<p>I am using Rails 2.3.8, REE, 1.8.7-2010.02 on Ubuntu 10.10.

I have an application that runs mostly on one thread. It has grown large, so I would like to run a watchdog thread that gets called whenever the main thread changes into a different block of code / method / class so I can see there is \"movement\" in the code. If the watchdog gets called by the same area for more than a second or a few, it shall set a volatile boolean that the main thread reads at the next checkpoint and terminate / restart.\nNow the problem is getting either of the threads to run somewhat at the same time. As soon as the main thread is running, it will not let the watchdog timer count properly. I was therefore thinking of yielding every time it calls the watchdog (so it could calculate time passed and set the value) but to no avail. Using Thread.sleep(1) instead of Thread.yield() works. But I don't want to have several areas of code just wasting calculation time, I am sure I am not doing it the way it is meant to be used.</p>\n\n<p>Here a very simple example of how I would use Thread.yield(). I do not understand why the Threads here will not switch (they do, after a \"long\" and largely unpredictable time). Please give me an advice on how to make this simple example output ONE and TWO after each other.

The problem I am having is that the <strong>program is terminating before the other Spring beans have completely finished</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a cut-down version of the code I'm using, I can supply more code/configuration if needed.

This delivers an active \"push\" approach to the flow, rather than the common approach of polling for data. This is where my problem comes in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void startImport() throws Exception {\n    for (Item item : items) {\n        gatewayBean.publish(item);\n        Thread.sleep(200); // Yield period\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For completeness, the flow XML looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;gateway default-request-channel=\"inChannel\" service-interface=\"GatewayBean\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;splitter input-channel=\"inChannel\" output-channel=\"splitChannel\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;payload-type-router input-channel=\"splitChannel\"&gt;\n    &lt;mapping type=\"Item\" channel=\"itemChannel\" /&gt;\n    &lt;mapping type=\"SomeOtherItem\" channel=\"anotherChannel\" /&gt;\n&lt;/payload-type-router&gt;\n\n&lt;outbound-channel-adapter channel=\"itemChannel\" ref=\"DAOBean\" method=\"persist\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The flow starts and processes items effectively, but once the startImport() loop finishes the main thread terminates and tears down all the Spring Integration threads immediately.
