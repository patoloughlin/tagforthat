It would in theory paste the values from the first sheet to first row of the second worksheet which does not have content.

So I built a custom stock chart with live yahoo data that can scroll and zoom. I have the chart and data set to change according to the Ticker symbol in a certain cell.

All the historical data and background stuff is on its own hidden sheet.  </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Here is where it gets tricky.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I wrote a VBA code to calculate HLC_3 in a new column on the hidden data sheet. When I run the code it works like a charm. However I can only run it when I actively in the data sheet. I already have a vba code to run when the symbol gets reset that sets the chart axes using <code>Worksheet_Change</code> and the code looks into the data sheet to find max and min. </p>\n\n<p>Since that worked I thought I could run the HLC_3 code the same way but it didn't work. It gets stuck on the first method which is just to count the non 0 rows in the data, and says there is no data to count. Remember if I run it from the data sheet it works. </p>\n\n<p>By deduction I found two issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If I change the symbol the HLC_3 VBA code trys to run before the SMF-Add-In array can download the data. So I tried a wait for a few seconds, it waited but still didn't work. </li>\n<li>I made a square and assigned the HLC_3 macro to it on the chart's sheet, changed the symbol, everything updated properly, then I pushed the button, and the macro failed and gave the same error as before. The question is how can I run HLC_3, which does everything in the back-end data sheet, from the front end sheet a few seconds after the array data download? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Below is my auto trigger, the HLC_3 part doesn't work, I have even tried to put the auto trigger in the data sheet page code but that did not even run at all even when something changed.

E.g., If Question 2 is in cell A1 and has 3 response options, these are listed below the question in cells A2-C2, A3-C3, etc.  Note: Only one of A2-C2, etc. is filled w/ data for each observation.</p>\n\n<p>It seems clear that I <em>could</em> go through the spreadsheet manually and concatenate A2-C2 using code similar to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>=CONCATENATE(IF(ISBLANK(A4),\"\",A4),IF(ISBLANK(B4),\"\",B4),IF(ISBLANK(C4),\"\",C4))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, the above requires manually altering the code (questions have anywhere from 2-6 response options) and copying/pasting it through all observations for each of the 960 variables individually.

(i.e. the following allows the program to complete successfully)</p>\n\n<pre><code>Try\n    modify sheet code\nCatch ex As Exception\n    identical modify sheet code\nEnd Try\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've done quite a bit of hunting around but I cannot figure out how to stop this from happening. The random nature of the exceptions make me think it might be something like the garbage collector which runs at unpredictable times, but I don't know how to go about testing that theory.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","ms-office"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":285,"score":0,"question_id":6821255,"title":"Microsoft Excel 2007 \"Find and Replace\"","body":"<p>Microsoft Excel 2007 Find and Replace tool does not produce an error message <code>Microsoft Excel cannot find the data you're searching for</code> when I enter an incorrect number; such as if I had a number range of 1 to 10 and I entered 22 on Find what, then pressing enter or FIND NEXT button - nothing happens <code>NO ERROR MESSAGE</code>.

I can't find what I am looking for and I have no idea where to start. I did read that for some reason, MS took out the Calender Control in forms and reports from Access in the 2010 version... Makes NO sense to me, but whatever. After doing more research, it seems like this MAY be able to be done in Excel, but I still don't see how it can be done yet.</p>\n\n<p>Next Edit. The type of Calender I want to use should look somewhat like this</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=880&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=WR_gZPF0plXvWM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/16553160/Year-Round-School-Calendar-2009-2010-March-2010-S-7-14-21-28-7-14-21-28-S-M-1-8-15-22-29-T-2-9-16-23-30-W-3-10-17-24-31-T-4-11-18-25-F-5-12-19-26-S-6-13-20-27-W-4-11-18-25-T-5-12-19-26-F-6-13-20&amp;docid=_aFOfbu3eBlxcM&amp;imgurl=http://img.docstoccdn.com/thumb/orig/16553160.png&amp;w=1275&amp;h=1650&amp;ei=Q8yKUJmuIZCK9gTd34HACg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=357&amp;sig=117327434000511743512&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=117&amp;start=24&amp;ndsp=35&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:20,i:158&amp;tx=104&amp;ty=49\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=880&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=WR_gZPF0plXvWM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/16553160/Year-Round-School-Calendar-2009-2010-March-2010-S-7-14-21-28-7-14-21-28-S-M-1-8-15-22-29-T-2-9-16-23-30-W-3-10-17-24-31-T-4-11-18-25-F-5-12-19-26-S-6-13-20-27-W-4-11-18-25-T-5-12-19-26-F-6-13-20&amp;docid=_aFOfbu3eBlxcM&amp;imgurl=http://img.docstoccdn.com/thumb/orig/16553160.png&amp;w=1275&amp;h=1650&amp;ei=Q8yKUJmuIZCK9gTd34HACg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=357&amp;sig=117327434000511743512&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=117&amp;start=24&amp;ndsp=35&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:20,i:158&amp;tx=104&amp;ty=49</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","excel-vba","double-click"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":13098369,"title":"Avoid selection in a form when double-click","body":"<p>In <a href=\"/questions/tagged/excel-2007\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'excel-2007'\" rel=\"tag\">excel-2007</a> I have a macro that when double clicking a cell, a form will open.</p>\n\n<p>When the relevant cell is located within the range in which the form will appear, an undesired selection is carried out in the form. </p>\n\n<p>How can I avoid this selection?</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","excel-2007","excel-formula","conditional-formatting"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":30,"score":1,"question_id":13104524,"title":"How to create a conditional format in excel 2007 from another cell","body":"<ul>\n<li>I have a sheet with 4 fields spanning <code>A3:D3</code> </li>\n<li>in <code>D3</code> I have a conditional format that turns the cell yellow if it equals the word \"no contact\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How can I get Cells <code>A3:C3</code> to also turn yellow if this is the case, any help would be greatly appreciated</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","macros","rows"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":332,"score":0,"question_id":11888683,"title":"Copy Excel rows if 3 conditions are met for 50 different variables","body":"<p>I'm trying to write a macro that will copy the rows if 3 conditions are met.

My typical worksheet contains long columns of empirical data of up to 1 million rows. My macros usually need to to run through each row from the top to the bottom and do some Quantlib-typical financial analysis stuff like revaluing a security, which requires that Quantlib objects be created in every row. The analytical stuff is contained within the cells as formulas.</p>\n\n<p>So in the beginning I tried to just select the cells with formulas in the top row and fill them down by dragging the lower right corner to the bottom of the sheet. Already here, the processing time grew exponentially with the number of rows involved.</p>\n\n<p>So I figured I had to write a macro that processes smaller chunks of rows at one time. The macro would basically take care of filling down the top row only 100 rows at a time. That and a number of optimizations (explained below) certainly improved speed tremendously, but processing time still grew exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that as much as I try to optimize my macros, they keep getting slower and slower the longer they run. I keep track of processed rows in the status bar, and for example if 2000 rows are processed per minute (the calculations are pretty involved) when kick-starting the macro, its speed decreases constantly throughout its runtime, for example to only 100 rows per minute after 60,000 rows. At that rhythm, it will never see the end of the sheet. So in fact, at some point it becomes optimal to just abort it and start it off again from where it stopped. I also splitted the files and let them run on different computers simultaneouesly, which is a pain in the ass in terms of managing.</p>\n\n<p>I already implemented tons of optimizations:\n- screen updating and automatic calculations are turned off.\n- I only perform calculation on the row being processed at a time.\n- garbage collecting: Quantlib objects are deleted immediately after they are no longer used. I thought it was them eating all free memory that caused the slow-downs.\n- I got so far to write the relevant results (cells) to a text file and delete the rows that were no longer needed. Again, the macro was very fast in the beginning and would have run until the end within a couple of hours if it wasn't getting slower again after like 70,000 rows. In fact, I had hoped to see a speed increase during runtime as rows are getting deleted and the sheet shrinks, but it just doesn't happen. So I just keep halting the process ever 60,000 rows and kick-starting it again, but its tiresome.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to figure out what causes this behaviour of Excel not processing large amounts of data linearly and requiring restarts, and how to avoid it. If somebody ran into similar trouble and found a way around it, I'd be glad to hear about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Every time I halt the process to speed it up again by starting over, I noticed that I have to restart Excel, otherwise it resumes just as slow as before. My current hypothesis is that at some point data isn't cleaned up correctly. If this is the case, your solution would bring me any further. The Quantlib library has a method to look at how many objects still reside in memory called ohRepositoryObjectCount(). I call the ohRepositoryDeleteAllObjects() function after every calculation and they are being effectively deleted as per that other method, but maybe there is still some leakage that remains undetected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> I'm now convinced there is memory leakage as after a long batch the task manager shows 3 or 4 Excel processes consuming together about 1.5 GB of memory. When quitting Excel, it crashes (with a message along the lines of \"Excel is not working anymore\"), and the processes persist, so I have to kill them manually.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","csv"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":70,"score":4,"question_id":13105105,"title":"Processing CSV data","body":"<p>I have recently been asked to take a .csv file that looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ASSvl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Into something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gY8J1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind that there will be hundreds, if not thousands of rows due to a new row being created every time a user logs in/out, and there will be more than simply two users.

There are mainly two directions of working around this issue:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Kill the Excel process when Excel is not used anymore.</li>\n<li>Take care to explicitly assign each COM object used to a variable first and to guarantee that eventually, Marshal.ReleaseComObject is executed on each.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some have stated that 2 is too tedious and there is always some uncertainty whether you forget to stick to this rule at some places in the code. Still 1 seems dirty and error-prone to me, also I guess that in a restricted environment trying to kill a process could raise a security error.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So I've been thinking about</strong> solving 2 by creating another proxy object model which mimics the Excel object model (for me, it would suffice to implement the objects I actually need). The principle would look as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each Excel Interop class has its proxy which wraps an object of that class.</li>\n<li>The proxy releases the COM object in its finalizer.</li>\n<li>The proxy mimics the interface of the Interop class.</li>\n<li>Any methods that originally returned a COM object are changed to return a proxy instead. The other methods simply delegate the implementation to the inner COM object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Application\n{\n    private Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application innerApplication\n        = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application innerApplication();\n\n    ~Application()\n    {\n        Marshal.ReleaseCOMObject(innerApplication);\n        innerApplication = null;\n    }\n\n    public Workbooks Workbooks\n    {\n        get { return new Workbooks(innerApplication.Workbooks); }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Workbooks\n{\n    private Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks innerWorkbooks;\n\n    Workbooks(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks innerWorkbooks)\n    {\n        this.innerWorkbooks = innerWorkbooks;\n    }\n\n    ~Workbooks()\n    {\n        Marshal.ReleaseCOMObject(innerWorkbooks);\n        innerWorkbooks = null;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>My questions to you are in particular:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who finds this a bad idea and why?</li>\n<li>Who finds this a gread idea? If so, why hasn't anybody implemented/published such a model yet? Is it only due to the effort, or am I missing a killing problem with that idea?</li>\n<li>Is it impossible/bad/error-prone to do the ReleaseCOMObject in the finalizer? (I've only seen proposals to put it in a Dispose() rather than in a finalizer - why?)</li>\n<li>If the approach makes sense, any suggestions to improve it?</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["excel"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13084426,"title":"How to group rows in Excel","body":"<p>Hopefully easy queastion - but I can't find the answer.<br>\nThe situation is as below:</p>\n\n<p>A B C 3<br>\nA B C 4<br>\nA B D 1<br>\nA B E 2</p>\n\n<p>How do I get to (in an automated manner)</p>\n\n<p>A B C 7<br>\nA B D 1<br>\nA B E 2</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","excel","delete","cell","rows"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":22,"score":-1,"question_id":13083883,"title":"I have a list of rows in Excel that I need to delete from MySQL database.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post ^^ Here goes..</p>\n\n<p>I am currently creating a spreadsheet that is been extracted from the database whereby I am tasked to concatenate data from 2 adjacent cells. I change the database on a frequent basis adding or removing data wherever necessary so the range of data is always different. To concatenate the two cells I use the following formula:</p>\n\n<p>e.g:  =IF(ISBLANK(B8&amp;H8),\"\",B8&amp;H8)</p>\n\n<p>This formula works out great when im dealing with increasing amounts of data as I can simply drag the formula down as far as i want and i know that it will pick up the formula whenever I refresh the database without the need of seeing value errors when the formula ends up referring to a blank cell. The snag here (and my query as well) is if I have less data then before the formula within the last set of cells looks something like this:</p>\n\n<p>e.g:  =IF(ISBLANK(#REF!&amp;#REF!),\"\",#REF!&amp;#REF!)</p>\n\n<p>I have dealt with #REF before in other spreadsheets whereby I simply used a ISERROR in the statement but I dont know if there is a possible way of including this within my formula. I need the ISBLANK there so I have more control and dont have to drag the formula as often.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a better way around this or a way to amend the current formula Id appreciate the help :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","excel-vba","excel-2007"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":99,"score":0,"question_id":13056051,"title":"Convert Date from yyyymmdd to mm/dd/yyyy Excel","body":"<p>I have been searching for about an hour on how to do this in Excel.</p>\n\n<p>I have an Excel file that was created from an old system and I am pulling information from a SQL Server Database, I will be inputting the information back into the SQL Server Database and would like the Dates to match.  </p>\n\n<p>I have tried Creating a Custom Format, but I am unsure if I even did it Correctly.

When I execute this perl script after the changes, I am getting invalid index method/property get error. This is the script where it is throwing an error. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#Begin subroutines\n    sub writeUUs\n    {\n        my ($sql1, $column1, $row1, $brandName1) = @_;\n        my $cellRange;\n        my $Sheet = $Book -&gt; Worksheets($brandName1);\n        $Sheet -&gt; Activate();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","excel","csv"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":69,"score":3,"question_id":13061660,"title":"Insert Image in csv file using php script","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11337142/php-code-can-insert-image-to-excel-file-and-open-it-correctly-in-ms-excel\">PHP code can insert image to excel file and open it correctly in MS Excel?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to add images in <code>.csv</code> file with the help of PHP script.

I don't want to add any new features to the current Inputbox, I'd just prefer it not have the Windows XP appearance. Is there a place I can find the source code for the Excel InputBox method that I could use in a custom form I create?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","excel","csv","graph"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":590,"score":2,"question_id":11454392,"title":"Externally create an excel graph from a CSV file","body":"<p>I have a bunch of data that I am saving out into .csv (Comma Seperated Value) format.\nIn excel, I can easily create a bar graph of this by manually selecting the data and hitting Graph.</p>\n\n<p>However, I want to do this externally with a click of a button.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I hit a button in C#.

Then based on that table, I can generate a new collection, or should I improve on the algorithm I have?</p>\n\n<p>For example:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>item[unique_id]: item number, price\n\nItem[1]: 11111, 10\nItem[2]: 22222, 2\nItem[3]: 11111, 3\nItem[4]: 11111, 15\nItem[5]: 22222, 1\nItem[6]: 33333, 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then the result collection would be something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Item[3]: 11111, 3\nItem[5]: 22222, 1\nItem[6]: 33333, 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Currently, I have code that does the following to create that new collection</p>\n\n<pre><code>For Each Item in OriginalCollection\n\n    ' Temp item holder for comparison\n    Set minItem = item\n    i = 1\n\n    Do While (i &lt;= OriginalCollection.Count)\n      if OriginalCollection(i).itemNumber = minItem.itemNumber And OriginalCollection(i).price &lt; minItem.price Then\n        Set minItem = OriginalCollection(i)\n\n        ' reduce the size of collection, so fewer iterations\n        OriginalCollection.Remove (i)\n        OriginalCollection.Remove (minItem.Id)\n      End if\n      i = i + 1\n    Loop\n\n    If Not InCollection (MinCollection, minItem.Id) Then\n        MinCollection.Add minItem, minItem.Id\n    End If\nNext item\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","vba","excel-vba","excel-2007"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":68,"score":-2,"question_id":13011177,"title":"automating account reconciliation in excel","body":"<p>I have a spread sheet with three columns. the first column contains names of people. the second column contains dates. the third column contains amounts received and invoices paid for the date. </p>\n\n<p>eg:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Name  date         amount\nabc   1-jan-2012   2000 usd\nabc   2-jan-2012   (1500) usd\nabc   3-jan-2012   2000 usd\nabc   3-jan-2012   2000 usd\nabc   3-jan-2012   (3500) usd\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i am trying to offset the invoices (positive values) against payments (negative value) received. if i use a lifo application then the net_value for the first entry will be 500 USD. the net value for the second entry will be zero.</p>\n\n<p>can anyone suggest a way of automating this exercise. i have written an if statement but the condition does not hold when the payments are more than the invoices (a case of advances being received by the client) </p>\n\n<p>thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>this is how the final table will look like </p>\n\n<pre><code>NAME    DATE    AMOUNT  NET VALUE\nabc 1-Jan-12     (4,910.00)  (4,910.00)\nabc 2-Jan-12     3,674.00    (26.00)\nabc 16-Jan-12    1,777.00    -   \nabc 17-Jan-12    (5,477.00)  -   \nabc 22-Mar-12    258.00      258.00 \nabc 31-Mar-12    5,502.00    1,465.00 \nabc 7-May-12     3,986.00    -   \nabc 20-May-12    5,238.00    -   \nabc 23-May-12    (6,861.00)  -   \nabc 4-Jul-12     (6,400.00)  -   \nabc 9-Aug-12     2,238.00    2,238.00 \nabc 21-Aug-12    4,855.00    2,456.00 \nabc 26-Aug-12    (2,399.00)  -   \nabc 9-Sep-12     3,938.00    3,938.00 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>sorry guys for the confusion...</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","vba","excel-vba"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":79,"score":1,"question_id":12976259,"title":"How do I use a variable in FormulaR1C1?","body":"<p>I have a formula to get the closest value to given value i.e., </p>\n\n<pre><code>=SMALL(R1C1:R1C144,COUNTIF(R1C1:R1C144,\"\"&lt;\"\" &amp;8)+1 )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will give the closest value to 8.</p>\n\n<p>I want to use variable instead of direct number \"(8)\"</p>\n\n<p>Please help me.

I do Find/Remove all spaces and all my card numbers are transformed into scientific notation and the last digit turned into a 0. THEY ARE TEXT, they are formatted as text, I yelled into the screen that they are text, why does Excel refuse to acknowledge that they are text? (I would rather find a way to stop Excel's action than find a way to tell our programmers to put an apostrophe in every cell)</p>\n\n<p>How do I make it so that Excel just STOPS doing anything that I didn't tell it to do? Or at least stop it from doing anything to numbers it doesn't like. Maybe I can write a macro for whenever it discovers \"Uhoh I should change that number to something different!\" I'll make it format that cell to text a thousand times instead.</p>\n\n<p>Give me an error when I try calculating with a number larger than 15 digits, make my computer explode violently, that's fine. Just stop changing the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible? I have many thousands of numbers that need changing in many different scenarios. I just want to stop it from trying to help. I can't understand why that would be difficult. I have 2007, but answers for other versions would be great as well.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["asp.net-mvc-3","excel","mvc","interop"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":12985769,"title":"Return Excel file as result from MVC","body":"<ol>\n<li>If I opt for using Interop, does it require to have Excel installed on server-side?</li>\n<li>Are there any additional reasons why not to use Interop?</li>\n<li>Should I go for <code>System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView</code> server-side solution, populate it and write it in result?</li>\n<li>Any other intelligent solution that preserves MVC logic and features?</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["python","excel","api","bloomberg"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":664,"score":0,"question_id":9024056,"title":"How to implement excel BDP() function with Bloomberg API?","body":"<p>I'm not familiar with either BDP() or api.

The client returns the pivot table with selections made, and the program reads the selections in the pivot table using the PivotItem.Visible property.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the client only has an older version of Excel, and the pivot table get saved in an earlier format.  The program requires reading from Excel 2007, so when the pivot table is returned, I have to save it in the newer format before parsing the selections in the program.</p>\n\n<p>Problem: when iterating over the PivotItems, checking the PivotItem.Visible property for any PivotItem in a Page field always returns False, even when selections are made in the base pivot table.  If I recreate the pivot table and make the selections without conversion - iterating over the PivotItems and checking visibility works properly - items selected return True and items not selected return False.</p>\n\n<p>Question: Is there a workaround for this?  I've looked, but can't find any solutions.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Private Sub MakeSelectionsFromPivotTable(ByVal currentPivotFieldItems As Excel.PivotItems, _\n        ByVal currentPivotField As Excel.PivotField, _\n        ByVal currentPivotItem As Excel.PivotItem, _\n        ByVal currentAttribute As Attribute)\n\n        currentPivotFieldItems = CType(currentPivotField.PivotItems(), Excel.PivotItems)\n\n        For pivotItemCounter As Integer = 1 To currentPivotFieldItems.Count\n            currentPivotItem = CType(currentPivotField.PivotItems(pivotItemCounter), Excel.PivotItem)\n\n            For Each bucket As Bucket In currentAttribute.GetBuckets()\n                If bucket.nameMatches(CStr(currentPivotItem.SourceName)) Then\n                    bucket.Selected = (currentPivotItem.Visible) 'shouldn't always be false!\n                    Exit For\n                End If\n            Next\n        Next\n    End Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Details: The code essentially maps a PivotItem to a Bucket object, and a PivotField to an Attribute object.

I can now catch the error by trapping when all buckets are not selected for an attribute, but still would like to know what's going on - or if this is some weird esoteric Excel bug/feature.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","applescript"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12970836,"title":"How to apply theme color of cell in excel using apple script","body":"<p>I am using Apple script.

My task is to maintain one big table in shared Excel sheet. There are several macros and several userforms.

Both values are imported to column form userform's textboxes (commandbutton lunches MsCal -exported to class- which fills those textboxes with date). What I simply need is to have date format as mm/dd/yyyy in both columns in order to perform filtering and other operations. When this values are updated by worker that uses different localization than English U.S. date is entered as dd.mm.yyyy. Thats make proper filtering based on date impossible.

It is very slow which leads me to believe it is opening and closing the excel file and reading chunks of data at a time.<br><br>\n<strong>Exporting</strong></p>\n\n<p>PHP Excel for anything under about 500 rows. Works beautifully but is very slow and can't handle for than a few hundred rows with 32Mb PHP memory (Note: I am using cacheing which has helped but not enough)</p>\n\n<p>Basic tab-delimited text for any more than 500 rows. Very fast, no limit on rows but no formatting and not true excel.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I'm looking for an all-in-one solution that can read and write .xls and .xlsx files quickly and without running into memory issues.

The issue is that when I open the CSV file with Microsoft Excel, it will show these days as <code>01/13/2010 05:00:00 AM</code> and <code>04/01/2010  05:00</code>, respectively. The value of the second one is <code>04/01/2010  05:00:00</code>, but it still shows <code>04/01/2010  05:00</code>. I've made a few tests and I've realized that Excel is not able to determine which is the day and which is the month in a few cases. In fact Excel gets a string like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>__/__/____ __:__:__ __\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It deduces from the last two characters (AM/PM) the value of hour, it knows what the minute and second is, also, it determines the year when it sees the four-character long number sequence, so the question is about month and day.

However, assuming that the clients will have the same default date format as the data in the CSV, the month and the day won't be inverted. However, I don't want to open Excel and type the formula in, because I need to give this file to clients and it should show the right value whenever they open the file. So, I need to write the formula inside the comma-separated file, but... TEXT is two-dimensional and there is a comma separating my date from my format.</p>\n\n<p>If I type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>= ABS(-5),=TEXT(\"04/13/2010 05:54:00 AM\", \"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss AM/PM\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>into my file, I will see 3 cells, the first being <code>5</code>, the second is <code>=TEXT(\"04/13/2010 05:54:00 AM\"</code> and the third is  <code>\"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss AM/PM\")</code>.</p>\n\n<p>How can I prevent this behavior? Can I use something else instead of the comma inside my function call? Or can I change the separator? Or is there a better solution?</p>\n\n<p>Can you enlighten me, to learn how can I enter function calls inside a CSV file?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance to everybody who tries to help,</p>\n\n<p>Lajos Árpád.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","excel-vba","excel-formula"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":147,"score":2,"question_id":12462665,"title":"Excel split given number into sum of other numbers","body":"<p>I'm trying to write formulae that will split a given number into the sum of 4 other numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The other numbers are 100,150,170 and 200 so the formula would be \n<strong>x = a*100+b*150+c*170+d*200</strong> where x is the given number and a,b,c,d are integers.</p>\n\n<p>My spreadsheet is set up as where col B are x values, and C,D,E,F are a,b,c,d respectively (see below).</p>\n\n<pre><code>   B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |\n  100    1     0     0     0\n  150    0     1     0     0   \n  200    0     0     0     1  \n  250    1     1     0     0  \n  370    0     0     1     1   \n  400    0     0     0     2 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need formulae for columns C,D,E,F (which are a,b,c,d in the formula)</p>\n\n<p>Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","excel-2007","excel-2010","pivot-table","calculated-field"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":183,"score":0,"question_id":12866037,"title":"Excel Pivot table: Calculated field based on only the first row of a group","body":"<p>I've got the following data and pivot table:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/c0jBL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Total</strong> column in the pivot table is the sum of the following calculated field:</p>\n\n<pre><code>=start-TIME(7, 30, 0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that this calculation is wrong for what I want to achieve.

I finally completed the script allowing it to do what it needs to do. Instead of all the clearing, hiding, and copying I just made the delete work by adding all the rows to be deleted in an array than converted the array to a string of ranges that delete range would work on deleting all the rows in one go.

Also, is there a workbook function that \"normalizes\" these encoding cousins to a default for comparisons?</p>\n"},{"tags":["excel","vba"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":0,"question_id":12849419,"title":"Updating drop down list depending on selection in another drop down list","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12866023/dynamically-updating-select-list-based-on-another-select-list\">Dynamically updating select list based on another select list</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm struggling to fill a drop down list based on user selection in another.

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80010108 (RPC_E_DISCONNECTED))</p>\n\n<p>I have tried late binding, 12.0 Interop and 14.0 Interop versions.  I come up with the same result.  I am at a total loss.  I have looked out here and other places and have not found anything to help me.  The reason I start with late binding was because the client I am working with is using multiple version of Excel, and that was the one way I did not have to worry about the version of Excel they were using.</p>\n\n<p>This has been a real pain and I am hoping there is someone out there who can point me in the right direction.  I have exhausted all the ideas that I have at this point.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong></em>*UPDATE: 10/3/2012***</strong>\nBelow is the full class code.  I am using late binding.  As long as I keep the comment on the line towards the bottom when inserting images, everything works.  But as soon as I put that line of code back in, as soon as I have more then one image to import, i get the above error.</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Drawing.Drawing2D;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Reflection;\nusing GalaSoft.MvvmLight;\nusing LIRC.WPF.Client.DataObject;\nusing LIRC.WPF.Client.Model;\nusing LIRC.WPF.Client.Model.LIRCModel;\nusing LIRC.WPF.Client.Core;\nusing Sid.Windows.Controls;\nusing Microsoft.Office.Core;\n\nnamespace LIRC.WPF.Client.ExcelAutomation\n{\n    class ImprovedPropertyReport: ICleanup\n    {\n        #region Class Declarations\n\n            private LIRCEntities _dataContext;\n\n            private dynamic excelObject;\n            private dynamic book;\n            private dynamic sheet;\n\n        #endregion\n\n        #region Constructor\n\n            public ImprovedPropertyReport()\n            {\n                // Set the Data Context for this class\n                _dataContext = new LIRCEntities(App.GetLIRCEntityConnectionString());\n            }\n\n        #endregion\n\n        #region Export Method\n\n            public void Export(SaleHeaderInformation headerInfo)\n            {\n                // Get the Excel Application\n                Type oExcel;\n                oExcel = Type.GetTypeFromProgID(\"Excel.Application\");\n                excelObject = Activator.CreateInstance(oExcel);\n\n                ////Save the culture info\n                System.Globalization.CultureInfo ci = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture;\n\n                try\n                {\n                    // Set the culture info to English (US)\n                    System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(\"en-US\");\n\n                    // Create the Settings Model\n                    SettingsModel lircSettings = new SettingsModel();\n                    // Create the Excel Export Model\n                    ExcelExportModel excelModel = new ExcelExportModel();\n                    // Get the Improve Property Report Data for the Excel Export\n                    ImprovedPropertyReportData reportData = excelModel.GetImprovePropertyReport(headerInfo.SaleId);\n                    //Get the List of Improvement Sections\n                    List&lt;improvementsection&gt; improvementSectionList = (from isec in _dataContext.improvementsections\n                                                                       join ii in _dataContext.improvementinfoes on isec.ImprovementInfoId equals ii.ImprovementInfoId\n                                                                       join s in _dataContext.sales on ii.ImprovementInfoId equals s.ImprovementInfoId\n                                                                       where s.SaleId == headerInfo.SaleId\n                                                                       select isec).ToList();\n\n                    // Open existing spreadsheet\n                    book = excelObject.workbooks.open(lircSettings.GetSettingTemplate(\"ImprovedPropertyReportTemplate\"));\n\n                    // Get the first worksheet\n                    sheet = book.worksheets.item(\"Main Sheet\");\n                    sheet.activate();\n\n\n                    //Set the Main Sheet Header\n                    sheet.pagesetup.centerheader = String.Format(\"&amp;17Improved Sale {0}\", headerInfo.HeaderNumber);\n\n                    // Fill in Main Sale Info\n                    sheet.range(\"B1\", Missing.Value).value = reportData.SaleId == null ? string.Empty : reportData.SaleId;\n                    sheet.range(\"B2\", Missing.Value).value = reportData.SaleDate == null ?

We are using a 3rd party membership management app -- we cannot access the database directly, we need to use their \"query builder\" tool to get the data we want to mass update.

I did not get an error, which is something I guess, but I will not be able to find out if it was successful until after midnight!  :-(</p>\n"},{"tags":["visual-studio-2010","excel","vsto","excel-addins","excel-template"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":1,"question_id":12718012,"title":"VSTO pre-populated template available via AddIn","body":"<p>I'm new to VSTO - while within Excel, we would like the user to click on an Excel AddIn icon, to get a template of headings, formulas, colours/fonts, etc.  Is it best to create this via a VS2010 \"Excel Template\" or \"Excel AddIn\" project?</p>\n\n<p>Note that the populated template will need to contain dropdowns filled with data from the database (which will be transferred thru a WCF service).

I found some code in numerous places on the web that works fine for Open Office Scalc on a machine running Redhat. The problem I ran into was when I tried to download to an MS Excel on a Windows PC rather than to an Open Office spreadsheet. The problem seems to be associated with the length of the string inserted into a cell. If it is too long, Excel thinks the file is corrupt and won't load it. \"Too long\" seems to be about 255 characters, even though the MS Excel specs say 32,000 is the maximum length. </p>\n\n<p>To investigate the problem further, I tried downloading the same data as a tab-separated values file and let Excel convert it to a spreadsheet. Using that method, there was no problem loading very long strings into the spreadsheet cells. So strings much longer than 255 characters can in fact be inserted into Excel cells, but just not with the code I am using, even though that code works with Open Office.
