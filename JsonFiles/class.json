What I would like to do is then when a message comes into the inboundMessage function, i would like to loop through the linked list until I find a transaction code which matches, and then call the member function which is for that message, passing it the data in the message.  </p>\n\n<p>I think I have everything initialized correctly, but here is the problem.  When I try and compile I get an error saying \"func does not exist in this scope\".  I have looked all over for a solution to this, but can not find one.  My codes is below</p>\n\n<pre><code>StateController.cpp\n\nStateController::StateController(){\n  currentState = Idle;\n  prevState = Idle;\n  lastRunState = Idle;\n\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_BURN, &amp;StateController::BURNprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_MANE, &amp;StateController::MANEprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_MAND, &amp;StateController::MANDprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_PUMP, &amp;StateController::PUMPprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_STAT, &amp;StateController::STATprocessor});  \n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_SYNC, &amp;StateController::SYNCprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_VALV, &amp;StateController::VALVprocessor});\n}\n\nvoid StateController::inboundMessage(GenericMessage msg){\n  // Read transaction code and do what needs to be done for it\n\n  for (int x = 0; x &lt; txnTable.count(); x++)\n  {\n    if (compareCharArr(msg.code, txnTable[x].code, TXN_CODE_LEN) == true)\n    {\n      (txnTable[x].*func)(msg.data);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>StateController.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>class StateController{\n  // Public functions\n  public:\n\n    // Constructor\n    StateController();\n\n    // State Controller message handeler\n    void inboundMessage(GenericMessage msg);\n\n    // Main state machine\n    void doWork();\n\n  // Private Members\n  private:  \n\n    // Hardware interface\n    HardwareInterface hardwareIntf;\n\n    // Current state holder\n    StateControllerStates currentState;\n\n    // Preveous State\n    StateControllerStates prevState;\n\n    // Last run state\n    StateControllerStates lastRunState;\n\n    // BURN Message Processor\n    void BURNprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // MANE Message Processor\n    void MANEprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // MAND Message Processor\n    void MANDprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // PUMP Message Processor\n    void PUMPprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    //STAT Message Processor\n    void STATprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // SYNC Message Processor\n    void SYNCprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // VALV Message Processor\n    void VALVprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    void primePumps();\n\n    // Check the value of two sensors given the window\n    int checkSensorWindow(int newSensor, int prevSensor, int window);\n\n    struct txnRow{\n    char code[TXN_CODE_LEN + 1];\n    void (StateController::*func)(char[]);\n    };\n\n    QueueList&lt;txnRow&gt; txnTable;\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea what is wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","class","div","toggle","swap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13179276,"title":"Changing Classes by clicking inside and outside a div [Solved] + jquery scroll and auto center DIV","body":"<p>I want to make a horizontal tiles of boxes, with \"class-1\", when you click on any of them, its class should change to \"class-2\" while other boxes are still \"class-1\".</p>\n\n<p>when you click on another random box, this box should change to \"class-2\" and all the others should be \"class-1\".</p>\n\n<p>something like this <a href=\"http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects</a></p>\n\n<p>any ideas?

I have a bunch of classes (~10) that form a hierarchy. A is the parent of them all and then I have some B, C, D that inherits from A and some E, F, G, that inherits from B, C, D and so on. The hierarchy has many virtual methods which are overridden or not according to the child class.</p>\n\n<p>Now the problem is: I need to give custom behavior to some methods which lay high in the hierarchy (most of them are in class A) so that I can decide to instantiate an object, let's say of class E, with a specific implementation of <code>A::method</code> instead that another.</p>\n\n<p>I already know that I have 3 sets of behavior that I need so thing is not going to be so generic but my problem is that, to give a different implementation of <code>A::method</code>, the only OOP way that I know is by subclassing it with A2 and override the specific method. That would be nice but I would also need to generate a whole new hierarchy of classes that inherits from A2 (B2, C2, D2 and whatever). What is worst is that I would need A3 too and consequently also B3, C3, D3..</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering: is there a better solution? Actually available solutions to my knowledge are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>generating 3 hierarchies of classes so define A, A2, A3, B, B2, B3 that will become a hell to maintain</li>\n<li>using a non OOP approach in which in A::method() I just use an if/else to change implementation according to the specific kind (which defeats OOP)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I never used templates for something else than trivial situation so I don't really know if they may help me but they sound more suitable for parametric polymorphism which is not directly this case.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also open to solutions that are not so ortodox if they allow me to keep things enough simple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:\nThe specific case is that I'm working on a multiplayer game for which I have already everything set up for single player. The set of classes represent the dynamic entities which are involved in the game and they are customized entities with customized behavior.\nTo manage the multiplayer I need to differentiate them because Entities which reside on server will do more things compared to entities which reside on client but many of these behavior will be kept common. For example I have a <code>stopMe</code> method which should do something on the server but something else on the client while the rest remains the same. At the same time while playing locally <code>stopMe</code> just stops the entity while on server it must also generate a packet for clients and so on.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","multithreading","class","inheritance","initialization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":1,"question_id":13187762,"title":"Python threading override init","body":"<p>I am using threading.py and I have the following code:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>import threading  \nclass MyClass(threading.Thread):  \n    def __init__(self,par1,par2):\n       threading.Thread.__init__(self)  \n       self.var1 = par1  \n       self.var2 = par2  \n    def run(self):\n       #do stuff with var1 and var2 while conditions are met\n... \n... \n... \nmyClassVar = MyClass(\"something\",0.0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I get the following error:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>18:48:08    57  S E myClassVar = MyClass(\"something\",0.0)  \n18:48:08    58  S E File \"C:\\Python24\\Lib\\threading.py\", line 378, in `__init__`  \n18:48:08    59  S E assert group is None, \"group argument must be None for now\"  \n18:48:08    60  S E AssertionError: group argument must be None for now  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am kind of new using python, it is the first time I use threading...</p>\n\n<p>What is the bug here?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","class","methods"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":1,"question_id":13183501,"title":"staticmethod and recursion?","body":"<p>I have following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        baz=self.bar(10)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def bar(n):\n        if n==0:\n            return 'bar'\n        else:\n            return bar(n-1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>bar() as a recursive function it needs reference to itself.

Instead I write my own class and inside the class I use the built-in class as an attribute.\nExample: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SHA1 {\n    public static final int SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH = 20;\n\n    private MessageDigest md;\n\n    public SHA1() {\n        try {\n            md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-1\");\n        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void update(byte[] data) {\n        md.update(data);\n    }\n\n    public void update(BigNumber bn) {\n        md.update(bn.asByteArray());\n    }\n\n    public void update(String data) {\n        md.update(data.getBytes());\n    }\n\n    public byte[] digest() {\n        return md.digest();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the following simple class I don't have to use try catch when using SHA1, I can put my custom BigNumber class as parameter and I can also put String as parameter to update function.</p>\n\n<p>The following BigNumber class contains all of the functions what I need and exactly how I need them.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class BigNumber {\n    private BigInteger m_bn;\n\n    public BigNumber() {\n        m_bn = new BigInteger(\"0\");\n    }\n\n    public BigNumber(BigInteger bn) {\n        m_bn = bn;\n    }\n\n    public BigNumber(String hex) {\n        setHexStr(hex);\n    }\n\n    //reversed no minsize\n    public byte[] asByteArray() {\n        return asByteArray(0, true);\n    }\n\n    //reversed with minsize\n    public byte[] asByteArray(int minSize) {\n        return asByteArray(minSize, true);\n    }\n\n    public byte[] asByteArray(int minSize, boolean rev) {\n        byte[] mag = m_bn.toByteArray();\n\n        //delete sign bit\n        //there is always a sign bit! so if bitNum % 8 is zero then\n        //the sign bit created a new byte (0th)\n        if(getNumBits() % 8 == 0) {\n            byte[] tmp = new byte[mag.length-1];\n            System.arraycopy(mag, 1, tmp, 0, mag.length-1);\n            mag = tmp;\n        }\n\n        //extend the byte array if needed\n        int byteSize = (minSize &gt;= getNumBytes()) ? minSize : getNumBytes();\n        byte[] tmp = new byte[byteSize]; \n\n        //if tmp's length smaller then byteSize then we keep 0x00-s from left\n        System.arraycopy(mag, 0, tmp, byteSize-mag.length, mag.length);\n\n        if(rev) ByteManip.reverse(tmp);\n\n        return tmp;\n    }\n\n    public String asHexStr() {\n        return ByteManip.byteArrayToHexStr(asByteArray(0, false));\n    }\n\n    public void setHexStr(String hex) {\n        m_bn = new BigInteger(hex, 16);\n    }\n\n    public void setBinary(byte[] data) {\n        //reverse = true\n        ByteManip.reverse(data);\n        //set as hex (binary set has some bug with the sign bit...)\n        m_bn = new BigInteger(ByteManip.byteArrayToHexStr(data), 16);\n    }\n\n    public void setRand(int byteSize) {\n        byte[] tmp = new byte[byteSize];\n        new Random().nextBytes(tmp);\n        //reversing byte order, but it doesn't really matter since it is a random\n        //number\n        setBinary(tmp);\n    }\n\n    public int getNumBytes() {\n        return (m_bn.bitLength() % 8 == 0) ?

For some strange reason DateTime does get this next one right:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$test = new DateTime('2012-10-29'); // Monday\necho $test-&gt;modify('Sunday this week')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');  // 2012-11-04\n\n// But...\n\n$test = new DateTime('2012-11-04'); // Sunday\necho $test-&gt;modify('Monday this week')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');  // 2012-11-05 instead of 2012-10-29   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I think I can make the question clearer:\n<strong>Can the DateTime() class be used with monday as the first day of the week. If not, can the class be extended to use monday as the first day of the week.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nOk, I think I'm getting somewhere... I'm not a pro at coding classes..but this seems to work for the weeks. But it still needs rules for first day, second day... and also for the day name Sunday itself. I don't think this is foolproof. I would appreciate any help to fix it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EuroDateTime extends DateTime {\n\n// Fields\nprivate $weekModifiers = array (\n    'this week',\n    'next week',\n    'previous week',\n    'last week'\n);\n\n// Override \"modify()\"\npublic function modify($string) {\n\n    // Search pattern\n    $pattern = '/'.implode('|', $this-&gt;weekModifiers).'/';\n\n    // Change the modifier string if needed\n    if ( $this-&gt;format('N') == 7 ) { // It's Sunday\n        $matches = array();\n        if ( preg_match( $pattern, $string, $matches )) {\n            $string = str_replace($matches[0], '-7 days '.$matches[0], $string);\n        }\n    }\n    return parent::modify($string);\n\n}\n\n}\n// This works\n$test = new EuroDateTime('2012-11-04');\necho $test-&gt;modify('Monday this week')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');\n// And I can still concatenate calls like the DateTime class was intended\necho $test-&gt;modify('Monday this week')-&gt;modify('+3 days')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["python","class"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":1,"question_id":13131307,"title":"python class changes another class.

These special classes are dynamically compiled and stored in a byte array inside MyClassLoader. When the MyClassLoader is asked for a class, it first checks if its <code>specialClasses</code> dictionary contains it, before delegating to the System classloader. It looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n    Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; specialClasses;\n\n    public MyClassLoader(Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; sb) {\n        this.specialClasses = sb;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {\n        if (specialClasses.containsKey(name)) return findClass(name);\n        else return super.loadClass(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class findClass(String name) {\n        byte[] b = specialClasses.get(name);\n        return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);\n    }    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I want to perform transformations (e.g. instrumentation) on the <code>specialClasses</code>, I can do so simply by modifying the <code>byte[]</code> before i call <code>defineClass()</code> on it. </p>\n\n<p>I would also like to transform the classes which are provided by the System classloader, but the System classloader doesn't seem to provide any way of accessing the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes it provides, and gives me the <code>Class</code> objects directly. </p>\n\n<p>I could use a <code>-javaagent</code> instrument all classes loaded into the JVM, but that would add overhead to the classes which I do not want to instrument; I only really want the classes loaded by MyClassLoader to be instrumented.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any way of retrieving the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes provided by the parent classloader, so I can instrument them before defining my own copy? </li>\n<li>Alternately, is there any way of emulating the functionality of the System classloader, in terms of where it grabs it's <code>byte[]</code>s from, so that MyClassLoader can instrument and define its own copy of all the System classes (Object, String, etc.)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>So I tried another approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using a <code>-javaagent</code>, Capture the <code>byte[]</code> of every class that is loaded and store it in a hashtable, keyed by the name of the class.</li>\n<li>MyClassLoader, instead of delegating the system classes to its parent classloader, would instead load their bytecode from this hashtable using the class name and define it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In theory this would let MyClassLoader define its own version of the system classes with instrumentation.

And it's work much better, both in performance and readability.</p>\n\n<p>So I am trying to implement it in Java. </p>\n\n<p>the main Idea of this pattern is that you are working with objects instead of types, saving by this the time to find the \"Dispatcher\" class to handle your event dispatch.(Dispatching event is sending event to all the listeners)</p>\n\n<p>So lets jump into the code:\nIn this sample I will create AlarmManager and handle his alarm event.</p>\n\n<p>First we need to create our Interface for this event</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IAlarmEvent {\n    void alarmEventHandler(String alert);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the event itself:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AlarmEvent extends Signal&lt;IAlarmEvent&gt; implements IAlarmEvent {\n\n    public void alarmEventHandler(String alert) {\n        dispatch(\"alarmEventHandler\", alert);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is the AlarmManger:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AlarmManager {\n\n    public final AlarmEvent alarmEvent = new AlarmEvent();\n\n    public void init(){\n        // Dispatching the event\n        alarmEvent.alarmEventHandler(\"Wake up\");\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is an Activity who is listening for this event:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity implements IAlarmEvent{\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n        AlarmManager alarmManager = new AlarmManager();\n        alarmManager.alarmEvent.addListener(this);\n\n        alarmManager.init();\n    }\n\n    public void alarmEventHandler(String alert) {\n        Log.d(\"MyLog\", \"Event : \" + alert);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is how I wrote the Signal class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class Signal&lt;T&gt; {\n    private LinkedHashMap&lt;T, T&gt; listeners = new LinkedHashMap&lt;T, T&gt;();\n\n    protected void dispatch(String methodName, Object...arguments){\n        Set&lt;T&gt; keySet = listeners.keySet();\n        if(keySet.size() == 0){\n            return;\n        }\n\n        Iterator&lt;T&gt; iterator = keySet.iterator();\n\n        Method method = null;\n        do{\n            T listener = iterator.next();\n            if(method == null){\n                try {\n                    Class&lt;?&gt;[] classes = new Class&lt;?&gt;[arguments.length];\n                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++){\n                        classes[i] = arguments[i].getClass();\n                    }\n                    method = listener.getClass().getMethod(methodName, classes);\n                } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n\n            try {\n                method.invoke(listener, arguments);\n            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n\n        }while(iterator.hasNext());\n    }\n\n    public void addListener(T listener) {\n        listeners.put(listener, listener);\n    }\n\n    public void removeListener(T listener) {\n        listeners.remove(listener);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This pattern is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fast - no need to search for type and trigger the eventDispatcher, it's done immediately.  </li>\n<li>have great readability - Just by looking at the class you know exactly what events he dispatch, and how each event looks like.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However it's not working well. If I am using primitives for my interface, the Signal fails to find the Method and invoke it. And I don't like the idea passing the Method name to the signal. Any Ideas how to improve this?

I have no idea how to do this in Java, but in cpp, I would define a \"toString\" or \"display\" function inside of each class I made which converted the class object into something which can be displayed on a console or written to a file. Then I would overload the cout operator \"&lt;&lt;\", and use that with any ostream type variable. I am essentially not sure what the equivalent istream and ostream type variables are in Java.

I am not quite sure how this is going to be used later in the game, but I figured if I could get it functioning with a list, then changing the list to a string or an array or whatever could be done quite easily later. Once I know how to call this string I should be able to modify the code for all the other strings and integers I have to call. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","mockito","arguments","matcher"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2082,"score":1,"question_id":7500312,"title":"Mockito match any class argument","body":"<p>Is there a way to match any class argument of the below sample routine?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n     public B method(Class&lt;? extends A&gt; a) {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I <strong>always</strong> return a <code>new B()</code> regardless of which class is passed into <code>method</code>?

After searching in a lot of sites and forums all this week I found the point of the problem I was having. The problem is that when I create a New MFC project in Visual C++, if I set the Application type as \"Dialog Based\" and let the respective dialog class derive from its default CDialogEx, then the problem shows immediately compiling and executing the program without modifying any of the code (I don't know if you could try this in your machine).</p>\n\n<p>2.-The wired behavior is that with the dialog window active, if I click on a free space in the task bar (and even in another not maximized window), then the borders (including the title bar) of the window of the dialog-based applications stays as \"focused\" (not-grayed), being that clicking on the task bar or in another window that does not cover completely my application window then my application window should kind of lose the focus.</p>\n\n<p>3.-I realize this after a lot of code, because I discovered this behavior using a CFileDialog class, because when I create (DoModal) a CFileDialog instance, then my application window loses the focus (gets \"grayed) when the file dialog opens (as should be) but when the file dialog finishes, the borders of my window stays grayed (which is not correct), and it stays that way until I minimize and restore my window, or I switch to another window and return to my window.</p>\n\n<p>4.-I discovered that the problem was in inheriting from the CDialogEx class, because I created a New project from scratch (as I described in paragraph 1), to see if it was me who modified something that made my program behave wrong, and it turns out that the new project behaves as I described in paragraph 2.</p>\n\n<p>5.-The good new is that I tried creating a new project but this time inheriting from CDialog instead of CDialogEx. And for my surprise is that this new program behaves correctly, I mean, the wired behavior described in paragraph 2 is no present in this new project. As I described in paragraph 3, another of my problems was with the file dialog (CFileDialog class), fortunately changing the code of my project to inherit from CDialog, instead of CDialogEx, solved this problem too. I mean, the problem was the CDialogEx class.</p>\n\n<p>6.-I decided to write this question and also provide the information that I discovered because when I was searching I saw much people in different forums having the same problem without getting a solution. I want to mention that I tried all the advises provided in the forums and, as for they, nothing worked for me.</p>\n\n<p>7.-As I said, one solution is to change the inheritance from CDialogEx to CDialog. But my question is if you know something I should do to make my program behave correctly under the CDialogEx class, because I prefer to use the new interfaces and not the old ones. I also want to know if you experiment the same problem as me in your visual studio or not.</p>\n\n<p>I hope my information and your answers are useful to others.\nThank you very much for your answers. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","class","syntax","methods"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12900341,"title":"Best DRY Method for PHP methods 2 levels deep in a Class?","body":"<p>I am working inside of a large class that is one of the backbones of an application, we'll call this <code>myClass</code>.

As mainly a C# programmer, I'm used to declaring classes in a large scope, typically near the top of the file, outside any functions, and then constructing them when in use.</p>\n\n<p>After moving on to C++, the only way of replicating this is to have a default constructor, which is fine, but in some cases, I'd rather have a constructor which requires arguments than an argument-less default constructor.</p>\n\n<p>After searching around the internet for a solution, I've come across a few pieces of advice, which have their flaws:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Pointers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people have suggested to have a dynamic pointer in the desired scope, and then assign the pointer to point at the location of the class when constructed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>CClass* pClass = 0;\n\nint main()\n{\n    pClass = new CClass(1337);\n\n    delete pClass;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that you have to remember to delete the pointer afterwards, thus, static pointers are much more \"safe\". Also, I'm guessing there will be slight memory overhead doing this, albeit not much, due to having the pointer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Have a default construct anyway</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is sometimes recommended to have a default constructor anyway, which just zeros everything inside the class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CClass\n{\npublic:\n    CClass() : leetNumber(0) {}\n    CClass(int leetNumber) : leetNumber(leetNumber) {}\nprivate:\n    int leetNumber;\n};\n\n//Defaults leetNumber to 0 through default ctor\nCClass myClass;\n\nint main()\n{\n    myClass = CClass(1337);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what happens if you can't just zero everything inside the class? What if you have another class in there which cannot just be initialized to nothing? What will you do if the user tries to access a function inside the class without proper initialization of the members? (You could check for this, but I believe it would take too much code, especially if you have a lot of members).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Staying in a smaller, more local scope</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have been suggestions where people have said to stay in a small scope, pass the class as a reference to other functions that may need it, and construct as soon as they declare the class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CClass\n{\npublic:\n    CClass(int leetNumber) : leetNumber(leetNumber) {}\n    int getLeetNumber() { return leetNumber; }\nprivate:\n    int leetNumber;\n};\n\nbool GetMuchNeededAmazingNumberFromClass(CClass&amp; myClass)\n{\n    if(myClass.getLeetNumber() == 1337)\n        return true;\n\n    return false;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    CClass myClass = CClass(1337);\n    if(!GetMuchNeededAmazingNumberFromClass(&amp;myClass);\n        return 1;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is good in the sense that you can see what function needs what, but I can imagine a function needing a lot of external classes having a massive amount of needed arguments.</p>\n\n<p>There are many more examples, but I cannot seem to find one that I can rely on, especially coming from a C# background, where this stuff is nice and easy.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate more on what I'm asking for - in C#, you can do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Program\n{\n    //See how I'm able to do this, without calling the ctor.\n    static AmazingClass amazing;\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        //And then call the constructor when I want.\n        amazing = new AmazingClass(1337);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows me to create the class without actually constructing it, this is what I'm looking for in C++.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","class","multidimensional-array","scope"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":63,"score":2,"question_id":12901636,"title":"Preserving PHP $this inside of foreach loop with ordered array of methods","body":"<p>I have the following PHP class which contains many other app-centric functions beside <code>my_new_iterative_function()</code> but when I enter the <code>foreach</code> the scope of <code>$this</code> (which I <em>need</em>) becomes invalid because of context.

I would like the same thing with the users class, so there is one $users object that all the classes can access, without having to create a new object every time I need to use something in the \"User\" class.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize if my question is not clear, and thanks in advance for any responses!!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everybody for the replies!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","constructor","methods","instantiation"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1466,"score":1,"question_id":3098881,"title":"calling class method (with constructors) without object instantiation in php","body":"<p>Ive looked and tried but I can't find an answer. </p>\n\n<p>In PHP, is it possible to call a class' member function (when that class requires a constructor to receive parameters) without instantiating it as an object?</p>\n\n<p>A code example (which gives errors):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass Test {\n    private $end=\"\";\n\n    function __construct($value) {\n        $this-&gt;end=$value;\n    }\n\n    public function alert($value) {\n        echo $value.\" \".$this-&gt;end;\n    }\n}\n\n//this works:\n$example=new Test(\"world\");\n$example-&gt;alert(\"hello\");\n\n//this does not work:\necho Test(\"world\")::alert(\"hello\");\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","class","lambda","entities"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":4,"question_id":12814399,"title":"select an element from a custom column from a list","body":"<p>I am trying to implement Searching for a custom element in a list with  a custom column name using a webservice for JQgrid, but I am out of ideas I would appreciate any help on this.</p>\n\n<p>I can't copy my code here but, for example, I have an entity like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test\n{\n    public int ID {get; set;}\n    public string Name {get; set;}\n    public string Nationality {get; set;}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I created a function to return a list of this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static List &lt;Test&gt; getList()\n{\n    List&lt;Test&gt; testList = new List&lt;Test&gt;();\n    Test testList1 = new Test();\n\n    testList1.ID = 123;\n    testList1.Name = \"asd\";\n    testList1.Nationality = \"qwe\";\n\n    testList.Add(testList1);\n    return testList;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and from the querystring I get the searchField and searchString, I have stored these values in strings searchField and searchString.</p>\n\n<p>I want something to work similar to this function (I know its wrong but I want that functionality):</p>\n\n<pre><code>list=testList.Where(x=&gt;x.searchField.Contains(searchString));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have no problem with getting the list or anything but I just want something similar to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","templates","arguments","main"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":12812840,"title":"Template Classes and main","body":"<p>I have the following class setup that trys mimicks a very basic stack.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;\nclass Stack{\n    public:\n        static const unsigned MAX_STACK_DEPTH =4;\n        Stack();\n        unsigned elements() const;\n        Stack&lt;T&gt; &amp; push(T &amp;value);\n        T pop();\n        Stack&lt;T&gt; &amp; show();\n    private:\n        unsigned element;\n        T stack[MAX_STACK_DEPTH];\n};\n\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nStack&lt;T&gt;::Stack(){\n    element=0;\n}\n/*Other class function definitions*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that I'm getting the following error in main</p>\n\n<pre><code>1   IntelliSense: no instance of function template \"calc\" matches the argument list c:\\users\\nima\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\projects\\calcu\\calcu\\policalc.cpp    109 6   Calcu\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my main</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(){\n    bool run=true;\n    while(run){\n        if(calc(input()));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>here are the other two functions declarations</p>\n\n<pre><code>string input();\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nbool calc(string line);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my calc function, It's not finished.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;\nbool calc(string line){\n    static T Ans;\n    istringstream sin(line);\n    Stack stack;\n    for(string token; sin&gt;&gt;token){\n        T t;\n        if(parse(t, token)){\n            push(t);\n        }else{\n            if(token==operators[i]){\n                switch(i){\n                case 1:{\n\n                       }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","class","variables","methods"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":12811903,"title":"Class Variables and Methods not Available to other class","body":"<p>I am getting this problem.

I'm just learning how to build scripts that use classes... and am a relative newbie to Python/coding. </p>\n\n<p>In principle, I'm interested to know if there is a way of calling the same func twice in a class. If I briefly explain what I am trying to do it might make some sense... </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to write a web 'scraper' that parses a seeded webpage, returns URLs based on some given parameters, follows those URLs, does the same thing (potentially n times) and finally returns a pdf at the bottom of the link. This is for speeding up some content collecting my colleagues currently do manually. (I have saved literal person months of manual effort with my relatively basic previous iterations.)</p>\n\n<p>This is a method I currently use, but the code I wrote is not really scaleable or easily reusable, and I want to try and make it more versatile (I'm currently hand rolling the script for each instance). </p>\n\n<p>(I think) I want to build a class called siteInstance that I use to hold the seed url, save locations, titles, u:p, cookie and the various funcs. that I use to walk through the site to get to the target content. </p>\n\n<p>There is a repeated function I use that parses the target URL and returns the next layer URLs. These are based on some site specific RegEx, so I know I will have to feed the search filter (regEx) for each layer of URLs. I would like to be able to reuse the parser, but feed it with the layer specific Regex. DRY is a thing right? </p>\n\n<p>In my mind, this means I have a func called siteInstance.parser, that I construct a number of within each siteInstance.class (e.g. <code>siteInstance.parserA</code> for layer one, <code>siteInstance.parserB</code> for layer two ... <code>siteInstance.parsern</code> for the nth layer)   </p>\n\n<p>Follows is a simplified version, in reality there is a number of cleaning/preparation steps at each layer to result in the correct generation of a list of target URLs for the next layer. This includes making of a file structure for saved binaries, writing logs, and firing the RegEx for that layer etc. </p>\n\n<p>This is a two layer example, but I know of instances that have at least 4 layers to content with.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Seed \n<code>{URL:www.journalTitle.com}</code></p>\n\n<p>Result of first pass (Layer1):\n<code>[{IssueURL2010:www.journalTitle.com/2010},{IssueURL2011:www.journalTitle.com/2011},{IssueURL2012:www.journalTitle.com/2012},{IssueURLn:www.journalTitle.com/n}]</code></p>\n\n<p>For IssueURL2010 (Layer 2):\n<code>[{article1_2010URL:www.journalTitle.com/2010/1},{article2_2010URL:www.journalTitle.com/2010/2},{article3_2010URL:www.journalTitle.com/2010/3},{articlen_2010URL:www.journalTitle.com/2010/n}]</code></p>\n\n<p>From <code>article1_2010UR</code> I can get <code>www.journalTitle.com/2010/1.pdf</code></p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense... </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","javascript","class","jsp","application"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":50,"score":-1,"question_id":12793032,"title":"Calling class file of another application","body":"<p>I have a JSP on my application1.

Apart from that, a C++ compiler treats a struct the same way it would treat a class. Structs could have constructors, copy constructors, virtual functions. etc. And the memory layout of a struct is same ad that of a class. And the reason C++ has structs is for backwward compatibility with C. </p>\n\n<p>Now since people confuse as to which one to use, struct or class, the rule of thumb is if you have just plain old data, use a struct. Otherwise use a class. And I have read that structs are good in serialization but don't where this comes from.</p>\n\n<p>Then the other day I came across this article: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/468882/Introduction-to-a-Cplusplus-low-level-object-model\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/468882/Introduction-to-a-Cplusplus-low-level-object-model</a></p>\n\n<p>It says that if we have (directly quoting):</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct SomeStruct\n{ \n    int    field1;\n    char   field2;\n    double field3;\n    bool   field4; \n};  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SomeStruct someStructVariable;\n    // usage of someStructVariable\n    ... \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{ \n    int    field1;\n    char   field2;\n    double field3;\n    bool   field4;      \n    // usage of 4 variables\n    ... \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are the same.</p>\n\n<p>It says the machine code generated is the same if we have a struct or just write down the variables inside the function. Now of course this only applies if your struct if a POD.</p>\n\n<p>This is where I get confused. In Effective C++ Scott Meyers says that there no such thing as an empty class.</p>\n\n<p>If we have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EmptyClass { };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is actually laid out by the compiler for example as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EmptyClass\n{\n    EmptyClass() {}\n    ~EmptyClass() {}\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So you would not have an empty class.</p>\n\n<p>Now if we change the above struct to a class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class SomeClass\n{ \n    int  field1;\n    char field2 \n    double field3;\n    bool  field4; \n}; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does it mean that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{\n    someClass someClassVariable;\n    // usage of someClassVariable\n    ... \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{ \n    int  field1;\n    char field2 \n    double field3;\n    bool  field4;      \n    // usage of 4 variables\n    ... \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are the same in terms of machine instructions? That there is no call to someClass constructor? Or that the memory allocated is the same as instantiating a class or defining the variables individually? And what about padding? structs and classes do padding. Would padding be the same in these cases?</p>\n\n<p>I'd really appreciate if somebody can shed some light on to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","algorithm","class","scheduler","greedy"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12775993,"title":"PHP Class Scheduler","body":"<p>I've been working on a class scheduler for our university as part of our class. \nI would just like to ask if PHP or any other framework is appropriate for this?\nWe aim to use Ext JS or HTML5 for the front end coding and PHP for the back end.\nCan someone point me in the right direction?</p>\n\n<p>The database looks like this. and business rules looks like this</p>\n\n<p>Schedules[x] runs 30 minutes per row then it will be compiled to 2 or more to form 1 class schedule \nThe meta data are:\nClass:      Faculty in charge:      Room:       Time:    Course:</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking of using greedy algorithm implemented in PHP.

So when \"Yes\" is selected for Veg the .ti class will show, but when add more is clicked then .ti will show up automatically and won't hide if \"No\" is selected for Veg. </p>\n\n<p>example of work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form id='user' name='user' method = \"post\" action = \"\"&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"sign\"&gt;\n\n&lt;div id='sign1' class='sign_block'&gt;\n\n&lt;span id=\"tib\" name=\"tib\" class='sign_3 ti'&gt;TL*&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;select name=\"ti\" id=\"ti\" class=\"required ti\" style='margin-right: 15px;'&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"\"&gt;--&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"1\"&gt;XX&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"2\"&gt;ZZ&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;/select&gt;\n\n&lt;span id=\"lastname\" name=\"lastname\" class='sign_1'&gt;Last Name*&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;input id=\"last_name\" name=\"last_name\" type=\"text\" size=\"35\" maxlength=\"60\" class='required'&gt;\n\n\n&lt;span id=\"first_name\" name=\"first_name\"class='sign_2'&gt;First Name*&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;input id=\"firstname\" name=\"firstname\" type=\"text\" size=\"35\" maxlength=\"60\" class='required'&gt;\n\n&lt;div class='clear'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;span class='sign_1' style='width:200px;'&gt;Level*&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;select name=\"level\" id=\"level\" class='required'&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"\"&gt;Choose One&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"1\"&gt;A&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"2\"&gt;B&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"3\"&gt;C&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n\n&lt;span class='sign_2'&gt;Veg*&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;select name=\"sg\" id=\"sg\" class=\"required sg\"&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"\"&gt;Choose One&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"1\"&gt;No&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"2\"&gt;Yes&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"buttons_block\" style=\"width: 960px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add more&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;input id=\"add\" class=\"submit_btn\" type=\"button\" value=\"Add\"&gt;\n&lt;input id=\"remove\" class=\"submit_btn\" type=\"button\" value=\"Remove\"&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n\njQuery.validator.addClassRules(\"email\", {email: true});\n\n $(\"#user\").validate({  //  must add this in order to run validator feature with the classes listed above//\n  rules:{\n    email_repeat: {\n            equalTo:'#email'        \n                    }\n    },\n\n  messages: {\n    email_repeat: {\n            equalTo: 'The two emails do not match'      \n                    }\n            },\n\nerrorPlacement: function(error, element){\n    error.insertAfter(element);\n}\n\n\n});\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n$('#add').click(function(){\n\nvar num = $('.sign_block').length;

In the object class, should I list all possible data members as default and set the unused ones as null, or ignore the unused ones?</p>\n\n<p>for example</p>\n\n<pre><code>class OBJ{\n\n  // common members that share among all posts:\n    public $id;\n    public $url;\n    public $embed_service\n\n  //post has grade\n    public $link_grade;\n\n  //posts has license\n    public $license;\n\n  //posts has corresponding topics  \n    public $comment_topic_id;\n\n//different types of data comes from different actions, saved in one table.\n} \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","multidimensional-array","openframeworks"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":59,"score":-1,"question_id":12759034,"title":"c++ 2dimensional pointer class array error (with openframeworks)","body":"<p>i am trying to create a 2 dimensional pointer class array.

However, I also have a function, that is supposed to create a new card and return it to the user, this function is now broken.</p>\n\n<p>The original command:  <code>card = newCard();</code> isn't available anymore, and <code>card = new CCard();</code> doesn't work. What other options do I have? I have a feeling using the constructor won't work, and that I probably should just create a class method newCard, but I want to see if it is somehow at all possible to do it the way the teacher wanted. </p>\n\n<p>This is creating a lot of headaches for me. I told the teacher that this is a stupid idea and not everything has to be classed in OOP. He has since told me that Java or C# don't allow code outside of classes, which sounds a little incredible. Not sure that you can do this in C++, especially when templated functions exist, or generic algorithms. Is it true that this would be bad code for OOP in C++ if I didn't force it into a class? </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank everyone for their helpful answers! However, I believe that my phrasing of the question is a little screwed up, and I think people don't understand what I am looking for. </p>\n\n<p>I do <em>not</em> want to initialize another member of type CCard. I want to intitialize</p>\n\n<p><code>CCard card</code> once and then give <code>card</code> new values through the constructor, because this is what the teacher told me to do. I do not want to create a new CCard object, just use the same variable with new values over again.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I said it probably won't work with the constructor. So I have a function that is supposed to take the initialized variable <code>card</code> and then call the constructor again( \"What?\" is what I told the teacher ) and then give it new values.</p>\n\n<p>Example code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo()\n{\n    /* Initialize card with constructor */\n    CCard card;\n    /* Give it new values through the constructor AGAIN... */\n    card;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the actual question. I'm sorry if I confused everybody xD</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","class","nsstring"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12693956,"title":"NSString between classes","body":"<p>I need to pass a NSString between two Classes (from ViewController Class_A to ViewController Class_B) of my app, I have searched on StackOverflow but this is the simplified code of my situation:</p>\n\n<p>Class_A.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"Class_B.h\"\n\n@interface ViewController : UIViewController {\n    NSString *stringToPass;\n}\n\n@property (retain, nonatomic) NSString *stringToPass;\n-(NSString *)stringPassage:(id)sender;\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_A.m</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (NSString *)stringPassage:(id)sender{\n    NSString *string = @\"A FANTASTIC STRING!\"; //here I define string INTO the - (NSString *) method\n    NSLog(@\"String to pass: %@\",string);\n    return string;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_B.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"Class_A.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_B.m</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    Class_A *Class_A_Instance = [[Class_A alloc] init];\n    NSString *importedString = [Class_A_Instance stringPassage:self];\n    [Class_A_Instance release];\n\n    NSLog(@\"Received String: %@\",importedString);\n\n    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, it works like a charm!

I learned AutoHotkey script, a bunch of c# and some or c++. My question is not language or syntax specific, but more of a concept. I'll start by explaining the situation (any code should be interpreted similar to psuedo code).</p>\n\n<p>My latest project is an instant messenger sort of program, with a server and a client. They work as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Server</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assign client info into 3 different arrays (I don't like this)\n<ul>\n<li>NewConnection[skt], userNick[nick], nickFromSocket[skt]</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Client</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Send messages to the server > server receives > server responds > client receives\nand logs messages to chat log.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You probably have already noticed that the array 'userNick' uses the users actual nickname in replace of the traditional index number (userNick[index]). This is important and works like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// New user has connected\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nNewConnection[skt]  // Simple to parse with a loop: NewConnection.MaxIndex()\n\n// Receive new user's nickname\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nnick = WINSOCK_getNick()\nuserNick[nick]      = nick\nnickFromSocket[skt] = nick\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The theory behind assigning the user's nickname twice is to avoid using a loop to parse the arrays. This is simple and can be achieved because when the client sends a message to the server, the server can see the socket number (which is unique to each user), with that variable, I can instantly get the user's nickname from 2 short lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Get user's nickname\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nnick = nickFromSocket[skt]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope everything is clear till now. </p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How can I convert all this to a class, yet retain the speed of getting data from an array?

All classes have to share some indexing features, but also all of them define a lot of properties. The properties are defined on class level with descriptors, to be able to intercept writing to them for validation and check for duplicates in the DB. For this, every class has a list of the automatically maintained properties, <code>_properties</code>. They also hold <code>_indices</code> and some other features, which I don't want to copy on my own to every single Element-class (about 10 or so). </p>\n\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BaseElement(object):\n    _properties = None\n\nclass ElementFlavour1(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n....\n\nclass ElementFlavourN(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'e', 'f', 'g'\n\nfor item in locals():\n    if issubclass(item, BaseElement):\n        item._v_properties_set = set(item._properties) if item._properties else set()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it basically does what it should do: I need to iterate the <code>_properties</code> linearly, but I also want to do quick lookups, if some property is present in a class.

E.g. subclasses of <code>BaseElement</code> in other modules wouldn't get their properties set right.

That looks fine now for this simplified code, but the function parse_file has quite a few levels of indention as well. I'd prefer to define the function parse_file() as a class function like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClass():\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        self.filename = filename \n\n        self.stat1 = None\n        self.stat2 = None\n        self.stat3 = None\n        self.stat4 = None\n        self.stat5 = None\n        parse_file()\n\n    def parse_file():\n        #do some parsing\n        self.stat1 = result_from_parse1\n        self.stat2 = result_from_parse2\n        self.stat3 = result_from_parse3\n        self.stat4 = result_from_parse4\n        self.stat5 = result_from_parse5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course this code doesn't work because the function <code>parse_file()</code> is not within the scope of the <strong>init</strong> function. Is there a way to call a class function from within <strong>init</strong> of that class? Or am I thinking about this the wrong way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","forward-declaration","friend-class"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":324,"score":4,"question_id":9890756,"title":"How come forward declaration is not needed for friend class concept?","body":"<p>I've just recently learned about <code>friend class</code> concept in C++ (I've googled around for a bit, but this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/437507/884412\">answer</a> made me laugh until I remembered the  most important parts), and I'm trying to incorporate it in to the project I'm working on right now. The concise question is singled out in the end, but in general, I'm confused by <em>complete lack of forward declarations</em> in my working code.</p>\n\n<p>All of my classes are separated through (sub-)folders and each one into a separate <em>.h</em> and <em>.cpp</em> file, but this should be enough to get a feeling about dependencies:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// FE.h - no implementations - no .cpp file\nclass FE\n{\n    private:\n       virtual void somePrivateFunc() = 0;\n    // 90% virtual class, interface for further implementations\n    friend class TLS;\n};\n\n// DummyFE.h\n#include \"FE.h\"\nclass DummyFE :: public FE {\n    /* singleton dummy */\n    private:\n        // constructor\n    public:\n        static DummyFE&amp; instance();\n};\n// DummyFE.cpp\n#include \"DummyFE.h\"\n// all Dummy FE implementation\n\n// ImplFE.h\n#include \"FE.h\"\nclass ImplFE :: public FE { /* implemented */ };\n// ImplFE.cpp\n#include \"FE.cpp\"\n// all Impl FE implementations\n\n\n// SD.h - implements strategy design pattern\n//        (real project has more than just FE class in here)\n#include \"FE.h\"\n#include \"DummyFE.h\"\nclass SD\n{\n    private:\n        FE &amp;localFE;\n    public:\n        SD(FE &amp;paramFE = DummyFE::instance());\n    // ... and all the other phun stuff ... \n    friend class TLS;\n};\n// SD.cpp - implementations\n# include \"SD.h\"\n/* SD implemented */\n\n// TLS.h - implements strategy design pattern\n           (on a higher level)\n#include SD.h\nclass TLS{\n    private:\n        SD *subStrategy;\n    public:\n        void someFunctionRequiringFriendliness();\n}\n\n// TLS.cpp - implementations\n#include \"TLS.h\"\nvoid TLS::someFunctionRequiringFriendliness(){\n    this-&gt;subStrategy-&gt;localFE.somePrivateFunc(); // ok!\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I've had party getting all of this to actually compile with all the dependencies (had to write it down in to a class diagram in the end to make it work), but now it does. The fact that is actually <em>confusing me</em>, is that <em>no forward declarations were needed</em>. I know about forward declarations from before, and just in case, I refreshed my memory with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/553869/884412\">this answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, to try and keep it clear, <strong>my question</strong>:\nWhen declaring the <code>class TLS</code> as a friend, how come no explicit forward declarations were needed? Does that mean that a <code>friend class</code> declaration is a forward declaration all in it self? For me, intuitively, something here is missing... And since it compiles and works normally, can somebody help correct my intuition? :D</p>\n\n<p>PS sorry for such a lengthy introduction to the question and a bunch of code. Please, don't comment on my code concept - friends are good here, I'm pretty sure it's correct for my current project (it's just a bit hard to see from this skeleton). I'd just like to know why no forward declaration was needed anywhere.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","search","html-lists"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":67,"score":0,"question_id":12643206,"title":"How to fetch list items by class from one page to another?","body":"<p>This is a continuation of a previous question, and I tried the previous method and I'm unsure if I did it correctly, or if it performs the intended function.

href=\"http://help.dottoro.com/ljslrhdh.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://help.dottoro.com/ljslrhdh.php</a></p>\n\n<p>I want the following properties/functions in Pages</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pages.length : is a read-only property.</li>\n<li>Pages.add(<em>key</em>, <em>value</em>) : is a function that will do an add like an associative array</li>\n<li>Pages.getByKey(<em>key</em>) : is a function that will return the value associated with the key</li>\n<li>Pages.getByIndex(<em>index</em>) : is a function that will return the value associated with the index</li>\n<li>Pages.removeAll() : is a function that will remove all the key-value pairs and therefore the length will be zero.</li>\n<li>Pages.removeByKey(<em>key</em>) : is a function that will remove the corresponding key-value pair </li>\n<li>Pages.removeByIndex(<em>index</em>) : is a function that will remove the corresponding key-value pair </li>\n<li>a constructor</li>\n<li>Pages.createFrom(<em>files</em>) : returns an instance of Pages object that will automatically create based on the files object as stated in the link above.</li>\n<li>Pages.indexExists(<em>index</em>) : returns boolean if there is such an index</li>\n<li>Pages.keyExists(<em>key</em>) : returns bookean if there is such a key-value pair</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most important characteristics are that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>whenever I add new key-value pair, it will be appended to the end of the Pages object.</li>\n<li>the key-value pair can be accessed by either the key using .getByKey(<em>key</em>) or the  .getByIndex(<em>index</em>) E.g., the first key-value pair can be accessed by index 0.</li>\n<li>whenever any existing key-value pair is removed or added, <strong>the length property is updated AND the indices are updated as well.</strong> E.g., if there are 5 key-value pairs and I remove the 2nd one, the 3rd key-value pair now can be accessed using the index 1 and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I do not need code for the various functions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I just need a skeleton structure of creating the above custom object class in javascript</strong></p>\n\n<p>I read <a

Just try to be specific if there's a particular part you need to see, if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this is work related so I hope I can find a solution quickly.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, when I originally encountered this issue days ago I 'solved' it by setting <code>global $clsLayoutDefinition;</code> at the beginning of the GetLayout() function.  However, tonight while working on the site I had encountered a really confusing problem and narrowed it down to that global declaration.  When I remove the global declaration, the other (more serious) problem goes away, but then I get the warning.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","jvm","classloader"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":2,"question_id":12596527,"title":"What happens if import statements can not be resolved?","body":"<p>I am not clear on the following:<br>\nA class is loaded by JVM when needed, like lazy initialization, right?<br>\nNow if class <code>A</code> does an <code>import</code> of class <code>B</code> which class <code>B</code> actually is not in the file system (e.g. <code>B.class</code> was deleted or not delivered or any reason)<br>\nthen does class <code>A</code> get loaded and runs <strong>if</strong> no method of class <code>B</code> is called?<br>\n<em>Or</em> class <code>A</code> is not able to run at all since the imports can not be resolved?<br>\n<em>Or</em> class <code>A</code> is loaded and run up to a certain point?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","class","asp.net-4.0"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":40,"score":1,"question_id":12632055,"title":"this.QueryString (NameValueCollection) access Form1 - from another class","body":"<p>i have made a helper Method using it to modify Query Strings, for testing and debugging</p>\n\n<p>the only problem now is that i would like to make it as a Class in my \nC# collection helper-class </p>\n\n<p>the method is working perfectly now , but as i am still \"fresh\" .net developer</p>\n\n<p>i couldn't figure out how to use \n<code>this.Request.QueryString</code> to access current <code>partial class</code> - form (form1) \nvalues when it's inside a separated public static or non static class </p>\n\n<p>this is the code , you're free to use it (:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void QsModify(string action, string NewP_Value, string CurQS_ParamName, string         NewQs_paramName=null, bool redirectWithNewQuerySettings=false)\n{\n\n#region &lt;&lt;=========== reflect to readonly &amp; set QueriString ReadOnly - false ============&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n// reflect to readonly property \nPropertyInfo isReadOnly = typeof(System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection).GetProperty(\"IsReadOnly\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\n\n// make collection editable \nisReadOnly.SetValue(this.Request.QueryString, false, null);\n\n#endregion\nswitch (action)\n{\n    case ModAQs_Remove:\n        if (notEmptyQs()) \n        this.Request.QueryString.Remove(CurQS_ParamName);\n        break;\n    case ModAQs_Replace:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Remove(CurQS_ParamName);\n        this.Request.QueryString.Add(NewQs_paramName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n    case ModAQs_EditValue:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Set(CurQS_ParamName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n\n    case ModAQs_Add:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Add(NewQs_paramName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n\n}\n\n\n#region &lt;&lt;=========== joining Full Path &amp; queryString then Redirection  ============&gt;&gt;\n\n\nstring seperator = \"?\";\nUrlPath = Request.Url.AbsolutePath;\nUrlPathAndQuery = string.Join(seperator, UrlPath, this.Request.QueryString);\nisReadOnly.SetValue(this.Request.QueryString, true, null);\n\nif (redirectWithNewQuerySettings)\n{\n\n    Response.Redirect(UrlPathAndQuery);\n}\n#endregion\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how do i make it into a class that will be able to access any project i am working on \nnot knowing what the form name will be </p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":12631628,"title":"C2365 and C2063 Class error","body":"<p>I'm trying to code a basic elevator simulation for a college course using classes.

Is this even possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","codeigniter","logging"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":1,"question_id":12572068,"title":"codeigniter alter Common.php functions","body":"<p>I'm trying to customize the logging functionality of codeigniter.

It seems to include other header files correctly when I experimented a little. here is the code in the two header files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_H_\n#define BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_H_\n\n#include \"TreeNode.h\"\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass tree\n{\npublic:\n    void output(TreeNode *node);\n    void addElt(string word);\n    tree();\n    ~tree();\nprivate:\n    TreeNode *topBranch;\n    int numBranches;\n};\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the above code is what I refered to as class A and the below is class B</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef TREENODE_H_\n#define TREENODE_H_\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include&lt;string&gt;\n#include \"PA4.h\"\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass TreeNode\n{\npublic:\n    string getWord();\n    int getCount();\n    int addElt(string word);\n    TreeNode *getLeft();\n    TreeNode *getRight();\n    void output(TreeNode *node);\n    TreeNode(const string &amp;w);\n    ~TreeNode();\nprivate:\n    const string word;\n    int count;\n    TreeNode *left;\n    TreeNode *right;\n};\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I searched online I couldn't find anyone with a similar problem, so maybe I am making an obvious error and missing it. If it helps I am using the MinGW compiler.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","search","html-lists"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":12548151,"title":"Search based on list item class","body":"<p>I'm not too familiar with anything beyond writing markup and CSS, and I have a question..</p>\n\n<p>If I have one .html page with a structure like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let's assume each of these list items has a class assigned to it, but the class is not unique, and is used multiple times.

So in this example, there would be a higher probability that the object ('RGSCAF', 181 ,6) is returned since it has the highest hits value.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","class","selector","multiple"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":443,"score":2,"question_id":9073847,"title":"select element with jquery that has multiple classes","body":"<pre><code>$(\".status\").attr(\"rel\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>.status can have up to three other additional classes added to it. \n.online, .away, .offline</p>\n\n<p>if I do this:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\".status.online\").attr(\"rel\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it works when status has online as a second class, but not when it's been changed, how can I do this and it not matter what other classes it has? </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","class","stackoverflow"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":66,"score":1,"question_id":12468659,"title":"Javascript StackOverflow Error","body":"<p>I was hoping I could get some help figuring out why a bit of my code is causing a stack overflow.  </p>\n\n<p>Code in question:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var ClassCreator = {\n    create: function(class_object,ParentClass){\n        var created_class = null;\n\n\n        created_class = function(){        \n            if(arguments.length == 0){\n                this.constructor();\n            }else{\n                this.constructor.apply(this,arguments);\n            }        \n        };\n\n        this._grantInheritance(created_class,ParentClass);\n        this._grantMethods(created_class,class_object);    \n\n        return created_class;\n    },\n\n    _grantInheritance: function(created_class,ParentClass){\n        if(ParentClass){\n            created_class.prototype = ParentClass.prototype;\n            created_class.prototype.BaseClass = ParentClass;\n        }\n    },\n\n    _grantMethods: function(created_class,creation_object){\n        //If there's no constructor provided, add a default constructor.\n        if(!creation_object.constructor){\n            creation_object.prototype.constructor = function(){};\n        }\n\n        //Add the creation_object's methods to the class we're creating.\n        for(var property in creation_object){\n            created_class.prototype[property] = creation_object[property];\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nvar SuperSuperObject = ClassCreator.create({\n    constructor: function(){\n        document.write(\"Hello\");\n    }\n});\n\nvar SuperObject = ClassCreator.create({\n    constructor: function(){\n        this.BaseClass.call(this);\n\n        document.write(\" \");\n    }\n},SuperSuperObject);\n\nvar RegularObject = ClassCreator.create({\n    constructor: function(){\n        this.BaseClass.call(this);\n\n        document.write(\" World\");\n    }\n},SuperObject);\n\nvar test = new RegularObject();​\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As far as I can understand, when I call this.BaseClass.call in RegularObjects constructor, it attempts to call RegularObjects constructor again, thus causing the stack overflow.

They are also located in different protection levels of the assembly as well so I don't want to just use the same class for every scenario.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Public Class Field\n\n        Public Sub New()\n\n        End Sub\n\n        Private _name As String\n        Public Property Name() As String\n            Get\n                Return _name\n            End Get\n            Set(ByVal value As String)\n                _name = value\n            End Set\n        End Property\n\n        Private _value As String\n        Public Property Value() As String\n            Get\n                Return _value\n            End Get\n            Set(ByVal value As String)\n                _value = value\n            End Set\n        End Property\n\n    End Class\n\n\n    Private NotInheritable Class FieldCollection\n        Inherits CollectionBase\n\n        Public Sub New()\n\n        End Sub\n\n        Public Sub Add(ByVal field As Field)\n            List.Add(field)\n        End Sub\n\n        Public Sub Remove(ByVal index As Integer)\n            If index &gt; Count - 1 Or index &lt; 0 Then\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Can't remove this item\")\n            Else\n                List.RemoveAt(index)\n            End If\n        End Sub\n\n        Default Public ReadOnly Property Item(ByVal index As Integer) As Field\n            Get\n                Return CType(List.Item(index), Field)\n            End Get\n        End Property\n\n    End Class\n\n    Public Class Data\n\n        Public Sub New()\n\n        End Sub\n\n        Private _name As String\n        Public Property Name() As String\n            Get\n                Return _name\n            End Get\n            Set(ByVal value As String)\n                _name = value\n            End Set\n        End Property\n\n        Private _value As String\n        Public Property Value() As String\n            Get\n                Return _value\n            End Get\n            Set(ByVal value As String)\n                _value = value\n            End Set\n        End Property\n\n    End Class\n\n\n    Private NotInheritable Class DataCollection\n        Inherits CollectionBase\n\n        Public Sub New()\n\n        End Sub\n\n        Public Sub Add(ByVal data As Data)\n            List.Add(data)\n        End Sub\n\n        Public Sub Remove(ByVal index As Integer)\n            If index &gt; Count - 1 Or index &lt; 0 Then\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Can't remove this item\")\n            Else\n                List.RemoveAt(index)\n            End If\n        End Sub\n\n        Default Public ReadOnly Property Item(ByVal index As Integer) As Data\n            Get\n                Return CType(List.Item(index), Data)\n            End Get\n        End Property\n\n    End Class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>etc...</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/CBdgKxGq\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a PasteBin of the code that I'm looking to streamline.</a>  Hopefully this helps.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","gson"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":118,"score":9,"question_id":12516412,"title":"What effect has $ in a Java class name","body":"<p>I recently saw the source code of the Google library Gson and saw something really strange (IMO).

Resit student does not have quiz and assignment marks.\nWrite a Java class called Student and provide the following:\n suitable instance variables for the information described above\n constructor(s) with the appropriate actions on the instance variables\n the accessor methods for the instance variables\n the computeScore() method to compute the score as follows:\nfor resit students, take only the exam mark as the score\nfor other students, score is calculated by using the formula\n9% * quiz + 21% * assignment + 70% * exam\nThe score calculated is to be rounded up to the nearest integer and returned.\n the findGrade() method that returns the grade based on the score:\n\nScore range\nGrade\n80 to 100\nA\n70 to 79\nB\n60 to 69\nC\n50 to 59\nD\n0 to 49\nF\n the toString() method that returns the attribute values as a string with description.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then this is the code i have so far is that correct? i mean the way i declared the constructors and such...tks</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n * To change this template, choose Tools | Templates\n * and open the template in the editor.\n */\npackage student_qn4;\n\n/**\n *\n * @author \n */\npublic class Student \n{\n   private String student_idno, student_name;\n   private int mark_quiz, mark_assig;\n   private float mark_exam;\n   private boolean student_resit;\n\n\n   public Student (String id, String name , int quizM , int assignM , int examM) {\n\n studentId = id;\n studentName = name;\n quizMark = quizM;\n assignMark = assignM;\n examMark = examM;\n }\n\n   public void setStudentnumber(String number)\n   {\n       student_idno = number;\n   }\n\n   public String getStudentnumber()\n   {\n       return student_idno;\n   }\n\n   public void setStudentname(String name)\n   {\n       student_name = name;\n   }\n\n   public String getStudentname()\n   {\n       return student_name;\n   }\n\n    public void setquizMark(int quizmarks)\n   {\n       mark_quiz = quizmarks;\n   }\n\n   public int getquizMark()\n   {\n       return mark_quiz;\n   }\n\n\n    public void setassigMark(int assigmarks)\n   {\n       mark_assig = assigmarks;\n   }\n\n   public int getassigMark()\n   {\n       return mark_assig;\n   }\n\n\n   public int computerScore()\n   {\n       /*do as the program asks then return the computer score */\n\n\n\n   }\n\n\n\n   public String findGrade()\n   {\n       // Based on the computeScore() i have to access what is the grade and return that\n   }\n\n   public String toString()\n   {\n       // What is this mehtod supposed to do?\n   }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","vcl"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":49,"score":-2,"question_id":12508617,"title":"VCL form application","body":"<p>I am using C++ Builder.

Users start with a basic pizza and then can add toppings to it until they're done.  So the first thing that my \"newPizza\" function does is declare the new Pizza as a <code>Plain</code>, which is a subclass of abstract class <code>Pizza</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Then they get to enter their choice of toppings.  Each time, a pointer to the same <code>Pizza</code> object is sent to the <code>addToppings()</code> function, the new decoration is added, and the pointer is returned.  Each decoration inherits from a price category, which inherits from <code>pizzaToppings</code>, which inherits from <code>Pizza</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is the relevant part of the main order function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Pizza* Menu::newPizza()\n{\ncout &lt;&lt; \"\\nNew Pizza\";\n\n//accept the next choice\nint choose = 0;\n\n//create the new pizza\nPlain * currentPizza = new Plain();\n\n//until they choose to end the order\nwhile (choose != 3)\n{\n    //accept the choice\n    cin &gt;&gt; choose;\n\n    switch (choose)\n    {\n        //if they want to add a new topping\n    case 1:\n        {\n            //add topping to current pizza\n           //and this is where the problem is spotted by the compiler\n            addTopping(currentPizza);\n            break;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The issue is that when I try to send the pointer <code>currentPizza</code> to the function <code>addTopping()</code>, I get \n\"Run-Time Check Failure #3 - The variable 'currentPizza' is being used without being initialized.\"</p>\n\n<p>Didn't I  just initialize it right there on line 7?</p>\n\n<p>If I hit \"continue\", the program keeps going, and works, but I get that same error every time I call the function.

Include a constructor that takes an <code>STL string</code> object as a parameter and passes it to the string base class constructor. Test your class by having a main program that asks the user to enter a string.

This particular class isn't OOP at all, that's actually the next class, but for this project the teacher said he wouldn't mind if we went above and beyond and did the project in OOP (in fact you can't get an A in his class unless you go above and beyond anyways).</p>\n\n<p>The project is(at this point) to read in an XML file, byte by byte, store element tags to one array, and the data values to another. I fought with him on this(given the .net frameworks dealing on XML) but that was a loosing battle. He wants us to code this without using .net XML stuff.</p>\n\n<p>He did provide an example of OOP for this program that he slopped together (originally written in Java, ported to C++, then ported from C++ to C#)</p>\n\n<p>In his example he's got three classes. the first, <code>XMLObject</code>, which contains the arrays, a quasi constructor, getter and setter methods(not properties, which I plan to fix in my version), and a method for adding the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> to tags to be stored in the arrays (and output to console if need be.)</p>\n\n<p>The second class is a <code>parseXML</code> class. In this one he has fields that keep track of the line count, file offset, tag offset, and strings to hold elements and data.\nAgain, he's got getter and setter methods, several parse methods that search for different things, and a general parse method that uses the other parse methods(sort of combines them here). Some of these methods make calls to the XMLObject class's methods, and send the parsed element and data values to their respective arrays.</p>\n\n<p>The third class he has is one that has no fields, and has two methods, one for doing ATOI and one for dumping a portion of the file stream to the console.</p>\n\n<p>I know we're essentially building a less efficient version of what's already included in the .net framework. I've pointed this out to him and was told \"do not use .net's XML class, end of discussion\" so let's all agree to just leave that one alone.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, should those really be 3 separate classes. Shouldn't the parsing class either inherit from the XML object class, or just be coded in the XML object class, and shouldn't the ATOI and dumping methods be in one of those two classes as well?</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to me that if the parsing class's aim in life is to parse an XML file and store elements and data fields to an array, it should be in the same class rather than being isolated and having to do it through getters and setters(or properties in the version I'm going to do).

What i am asking is:</p>\n\n<pre><code> class FooBar:\n       def __init__(self,foo,bar):\n           self._foo = foo\n           self._bar = bar\n           self.ans = self.__execute()\n\n       def __execute(self):\n            return something(self._foo, self._bar)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now there are many ways to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   class FooBar:\n         def __init__(self,foo):\n           self._foo = foo\n\n\n       def execute(self,bar):\n            return something(self._foo, bar)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can you suggest which one is bad and which one is worse?</p>\n\n<p>or any other way to do this.</p>\n\n<p>This is just a toy example (offcourse). I mean, there is no need to have a class here if there is one function.. but lets say in __execute something() calls a whole set of other methods.. ??\nThanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","class"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":58,"score":3,"question_id":12390583,"title":"Python:synthetic classes","body":"<p>I can make a synthetic class <code>cls1</code> that inherits from <code>cls</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class cls(object):\n...     def func(self,arg):\n...         print 'func',arg\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def func1(self):\n...     print \"func 1 of cls1\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def func2(self):\n...     print \"func2 of cls1\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d=dict(func1=func1,func2=func2)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cls1=type('cls1',(cls,),d)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Everything works as expected:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj=cls1()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; obj.func(7)\nfunc 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can also replace <code>cls1</code> with <code>FOO</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cls1=type('FOO',(cls,),d)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that gives me:</p>\n\n<pre><code>'cls1': &lt;class '__main__.FOO'&gt;,\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does this (changing <code>__name__</code> variable) alter the behavior of <code>cls1</code> and how (everything still works fine)?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","class","dataset"],"answer_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":12390729,"title":"C# What is the proper dataset for 3 value set data?","body":"<p>For 2 value set data, it is clear I can use Dictionary.

Right now I'm working on a project with multiple states, and it's my first attempt at a bigger programming task/challenge. Right now I'm trying to work on a simple menu state class, but I'm not sure how to go about designing it to do what I want.

For example, if the menu has 3 items, I want the user to be able to press up and down to switch the currently selected element, and if the user is on the last element (#3) and presses down again, they wrap back around to element #1. (and vice versa..)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I ~think~ that this will require me to make a new class called 'MenuElement', and a class called 'MenuState' which contains and allows the user to switch between and select a specific element.</p>\n\n<p>As a new, self-taught C++ programmer, I have limited experience with some of the more advanced containers and I'm much more familiar with simple c-style arrays. I have a little bit of experience with vectors, and I know a little bit about linked lists, maps, and trees, but I'm not sure which container type to use for this situation. I've seen examples of using pointers to create a circular linked list before, but the example was in C and it seemed a little bit clumsy. <strong><em>Is there a specific type of contain that bests fits my problem? Or am I over-thinking it, and I should just pick one and run with it?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I think I could eventually get this system up and running using an array of MenuElements with a series of conditional statements.

The project that I've been working on to teach myself is a C++ game that has multiple classes, files, states, etc. However, I keep running into snags with file organization that range from simply struggling with where to create objects to compile-breaking linker errors.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of some of the errors that I've been getting:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1&gt;SMGA.obj : error LNK2005: \"class Engine smgaEngine\" (?smgaEngine@@3VEngine@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;SplashScreenState.obj : error LNK2005: \"class Engine smgaEngine\" (?smgaEngine@@3VEngine@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;StateManager.obj : error LNK2005: \"class StateManager gameStateManager\" (?gameStateManager@@3VStateManager@@A) already defined in Engine.obj\n1&gt;MSVCRTD.lib(cinitexe.obj) : warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've looked around online and I've seen a lot of ~similar~ problems that involve bad include guards or the inclusion of .cpp files instead of .h files. But I haven't done that in my code, so I'm at a loss. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm guessing that the error is telling me that I'm trying to create the smgaEngine object of the Engine class (and the gameStateManager object of the StateManager class) twice, but I'm not sure why...</p>\n\n<p>The thing that stands out about these two objects (smgaEngine and gameStateManager) is that I declared them in their corresponding class' .h files immediately after the class declaration. Could this be the issue? - They're still within the include guards, and I wasn't too sure about where else to put them in my code... Would this sloppy coding be the cause of linker errors?</p>\n\n<p>Here's one of the suspect classes...</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef ENGINE_H\n#define ENGINE_H\n\n#include &lt;SDL.h&gt;\n#include \"Timer.h\"\n\nclass Engine\n{\nprivate:\n    static const int screenWidth = 480;\n    static const int screenHeight = 270;\n    static const int screenBPP = 24;\n\n    bool running;\n    SDL_Surface *mainScreen;\n    SDL_Event eventHolder;\n    Timer fpsTimer;\n\npublic:\n    Engine();\n    ~Engine();\n\n    void init();\n    void handleEvents();\n    void handleLogic();\n    void handleRender();\n    void cleanUp();\n\n    SDL_Event *getEvent();\n\n    SDL_Surface *getMainScreen();\n\n    bool isRunning();\n    void setRunning(bool tempRunning);\n} smgaEngine;\n\n#endif \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's the other one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#ifndef STATEMANAGER_H\n#define STATEMANAGER_H\n\n#include \"SplashScreenState.h\"\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n\nclass GameState;\n\nclass StateManager\n{\nprivate:\n    std::vector&lt;GameState*&gt; stateStack;\n\n    SplashScreenState *splashState;\n\npublic:\n    StateManager();\n    ~StateManager();\n\n    void init();\n\n    void changeState( GameState *tempNextState );\n    void addState( GameState *tempNextState );\n    void removeState();\n\n    //returns the back() element of the stateStack vector..\n    GameState* getTopState();\n\n    void handleEvents();\n    void handleLogic();\n    void handleRender();\n} gameStateManager;\n\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've been trying my best to learn C++ and OOP, but I've really been struggling. It seems that every time I attempt to make clean code with encapsulated classes, I end up with a confusing mess. I'm trying to prevent a high degree of class coupling, but I often end up with either linker errors or a lack of ability to communicate between classes... Is it creation of class instance objects within the header files that is causing these errors or is it something else? And if that is the cause of my linker errors, then where should I be creating these objects?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","class","unity3d"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":85,"score":4,"question_id":12314145,"title":"How does Unity JS have a class?","body":"<p>I was reading an article on Unity JS.

This means, the DB Helper will contain the code to open and close the DB, as well as the code for inserting, updating and deleting all records. The DB Helper will return data not as cursors, but as Data Class objects that I create, each Data Class will have a constructor which takes the cursor and uses it to populate the values of the Class.</p></li>\n<li><p>Data Classes will allow DB records to be represented as objects and not just cursors. As the DB Helper will only be returning objects I will have to create adapters for items such as ListView's to render my object's data as opposed to the cursor (I'm a bit fishy on this point, not sure if this is a good idea or not). All business logic, so all calculations to be done on the data contained in the Data Class, will be done in the Data Class itself. I envision my Data Classes having typical getters and setters as well as \"calculate\" methods, these calculate methods will take vars from the Data Class and do some meaningful business logic on them, returning the result (is this a good idea?).</p></li>\n<li><p>View Controller Activity Classes will literally tie the DB Helper's methods to the Data Classes and update the Views with the resulting information. This Activity Class will be quite normal, it will initialize the layout and widgets, it will use the lifecycle methods to perform various queries on the DB through the DB Helper at the appropriate times, and it will have simple update methods which update widgets using the Data Class object they're fed.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am finding I have no troubles with Android except for struggling with issues of design such as these.

I have a general idea of where to use static methods, but I'm not sure if here it's a good idea.</p>\n\n<p>My questions is about which is actually the best approach for the specific problem I am facing (described below). The general guidelines I've found online didn't help for this specific problem. Here is what I thought (from more likely to be correct to less):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Extend the Language class, create a single object (that gets the language in the initialization) and call a method with the $id that would return the translated string.</p></li>\n<li><p>Merge both classes into one. The language would be found when initialized and a method called when needed. But it would behave a little as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object\" rel=\"nofollow\">God object</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make the Language class static. Therefore I would be able to use it from within the Text. I would create a Text instance and call a method with different $id. Similar to using it with globals. There's almost no other place where I'd need to use the Language class.</p></li>\n<li><p>Extend the Language class with Text, create an object for each translation. This would probably create too much overhead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not do anything. It's tempting (don't fix it if it's not broken), but I intend to start developing with someone else soon, so clean and clear code is needed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Code</h2>\n\n<p>Now the simple class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Language\n  {\n  public $Lang;\n  public function __construct()\n    {\n    if ( !empty($_POST['lang']) )    // If the user tries to change the language\n      {\n      $this-&gt;Lang = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['lang']);  // Assign the language to variable.\n      $_SESSION['lang'] = $this-&gt;Lang;      //Sets the session to have that language.\n      if ($_SESSION['logged']==1)          // If user is logged\n        {\n        $User=$_SESSION['user'];\n        mysql_query(\"UPDATE users SET lang='$this-&gt;Lang' WHERE email='$User'\") or die(mysql_error());  // Saves the language into user preferences\n        }\n      }\n    else      // If no request is done.\n      {\n      if ($_SESSION['logged']==1)    // DO.

I know Its a long post but I would be very grateful for any help you can offer.\nI am working on a chatbot program that reads in from a .dat file to populate a library of keywords.

What is the most pythonic way to have <em>editable</em> values shared between apples such as <code>type</code> but also have individual attributes for each apple in the group? Coming from <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, my first instinct is a general struct, and a struct for each apple with a pointer to the general struct, as it seems silly for each apple instance to contain the group information, because if I wanted <code>type = \"Red Apple\"</code> I'd have to iterate though all the apples to edit their <code>type</code> value, which is a waste of programming power.</p>\n\n<p>In real code, on my current work project, I am currently working on a git script to help parse output in a way that makes sense for my company.

Why?    </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The answers by @Razvan and @LouisWasserman have been helpful.<br>\nI have 1 last question after these:<br>\nThe point from both seems to be the following:<br>\nFrom @Razyan<br>\n<code>System.out.println(\"My name is \"+ this.name); //&lt;-- note the this</code><br>\nFrom @Louis<br>\nThat the <code>this</code> refers to <code>Animal</code> and that <code>the implementation of display() is in the Animal class</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So far ok. But how are these points consistent with the fact that if I modify <code>display()</code> as follows:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Animal{  \n   String name = \"Animal\";  \n   public void display(){  \n    System.out.println(\"Current class is \"+ this.getClass().getName());  \n    System.out.println(\"My name is \"+ name);  \n   }  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then the result of:  </p>\n\n<pre><code> Dog d = new Dog();  \n d.display();  \n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Current class is <strong>Dog</strong><br>\n  My name is animal</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was expecting that <code>this</code> inside the <code>display</code> would be <code>Animal</code> as I understood the answers here. But it is not. Why?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","oop","class","static","inner-classes"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":1,"question_id":12052560,"title":"Access Modifiers in Java (static)","body":"<p>I got this program <a href=\"http://www.codeforge.com/read/147427/Term.java__html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> and I combined the two classes into one for practice purposes.

It still seems a bit off to me.</p>\n\n<p>/<strong><em>*</em>***<em></strong> Edit 3 <strong></em>**<em>*</em>****</strong>/</p>\n\n<p>Alright, seems to me the thing I want to do is be able to return a different instance than I called up.  So, call new item($module,$id);, but if $module == photos (in my example) I'd want to return an instance of new item_photos($module,$id);.  So far I've come up with 2 possible solutions.</p>\n\n<p>First is what I outlined in Edit 2 (see above).</p>\n\n<p>Second option would be to simply call a function (probably 'item') and return the correct object instance there (since functions can return any object instance you want while the class constructor only returns an instance of its own class).  So (basic example):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function item($module,$id) {\n    $class_module = 'item_'.$module;\n    // Module class\n    if(class_exists($class_module)) return new $class_module($module,$id);\n    // Core class\n    else return new item($module,$id);\n}\nclass item{..}\nclass item_photos{..}\n\n$item = item('photos',123);\nprint $item-&gt;id(); // photo-123\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not sure I like mixing function/classes, but it does the trick pretty simply.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","instantiation"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":8,"view_count":98,"score":-8,"question_id":12021662,"title":"Object instantiation and assignment in a class","body":"<p>Where can an object be instantiated and assigned inside a class? i.e does the assignment have to take place inside one of the class methods? </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Foo{\n\n   Bar b1 = new Bar();\n   Bar b2;\n\n   void Foo(){\n      b2 = new Bar();\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is <code>b1</code> a valid instantiation?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","class","classpath"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":145,"score":1,"question_id":12021499,"title":"How do I use an external .class file in eclipse?","body":"<p>I am having problems importing an external .class file into an eclipse project.
