What I would like to do is then when a message comes into the inboundMessage function, i would like to loop through the linked list until I find a transaction code which matches, and then call the member function which is for that message, passing it the data in the message.  </p>\n\n<p>I think I have everything initialized correctly, but here is the problem.  When I try and compile I get an error saying \"func does not exist in this scope\".  I have looked all over for a solution to this, but can not find one.  My codes is below</p>\n\n<pre><code>StateController.cpp\n\nStateController::StateController(){\n  currentState = Idle;\n  prevState = Idle;\n  lastRunState = Idle;\n\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_BURN, &amp;StateController::BURNprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_MANE, &amp;StateController::MANEprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_MAND, &amp;StateController::MANDprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_PUMP, &amp;StateController::PUMPprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_STAT, &amp;StateController::STATprocessor});  \n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_SYNC, &amp;StateController::SYNCprocessor});\n  txnTable.push((txnRow){MSG_VALV, &amp;StateController::VALVprocessor});\n}\n\nvoid StateController::inboundMessage(GenericMessage msg){\n  // Read transaction code and do what needs to be done for it\n\n  for (int x = 0; x &lt; txnTable.count(); x++)\n  {\n    if (compareCharArr(msg.code, txnTable[x].code, TXN_CODE_LEN) == true)\n    {\n      (txnTable[x].*func)(msg.data);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>StateController.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>class StateController{\n  // Public functions\n  public:\n\n    // Constructor\n    StateController();\n\n    // State Controller message handeler\n    void inboundMessage(GenericMessage msg);\n\n    // Main state machine\n    void doWork();\n\n  // Private Members\n  private:  \n\n    // Hardware interface\n    HardwareInterface hardwareIntf;\n\n    // Current state holder\n    StateControllerStates currentState;\n\n    // Preveous State\n    StateControllerStates prevState;\n\n    // Last run state\n    StateControllerStates lastRunState;\n\n    // BURN Message Processor\n    void BURNprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // MANE Message Processor\n    void MANEprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // MAND Message Processor\n    void MANDprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // PUMP Message Processor\n    void PUMPprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    //STAT Message Processor\n    void STATprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // SYNC Message Processor\n    void SYNCprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    // VALV Message Processor\n    void VALVprocessor(char data[]);\n\n    void primePumps();\n\n    // Check the value of two sensors given the window\n    int checkSensorWindow(int newSensor, int prevSensor, int window);\n\n    struct txnRow{\n    char code[TXN_CODE_LEN + 1];\n    void (StateController::*func)(char[]);\n    };\n\n    QueueList&lt;txnRow&gt; txnTable;\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea what is wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["jquery","class","div","toggle","swap"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":13179276,"title":"Changing Classes by clicking inside and outside a div [Solved] + jquery scroll and auto center DIV","body":"<p>I want to make a horizontal tiles of boxes, with \"class-1\", when you click on any of them, its class should change to \"class-2\" while other boxes are still \"class-1\".</p>\n\n<p>when you click on another random box, this box should change to \"class-2\" and all the others should be \"class-1\".</p>\n\n<p>something like this <a href=\"http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects</a></p>\n\n<p>any ideas?

I have a bunch of classes (~10) that form a hierarchy. A is the parent of them all and then I have some B, C, D that inherits from A and some E, F, G, that inherits from B, C, D and so on. The hierarchy has many virtual methods which are overridden or not according to the child class.</p>\n\n<p>Now the problem is: I need to give custom behavior to some methods which lay high in the hierarchy (most of them are in class A) so that I can decide to instantiate an object, let's say of class E, with a specific implementation of <code>A::method</code> instead that another.</p>\n\n<p>I already know that I have 3 sets of behavior that I need so thing is not going to be so generic but my problem is that, to give a different implementation of <code>A::method</code>, the only OOP way that I know is by subclassing it with A2 and override the specific method. That would be nice but I would also need to generate a whole new hierarchy of classes that inherits from A2 (B2, C2, D2 and whatever). What is worst is that I would need A3 too and consequently also B3, C3, D3..</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering: is there a better solution? Actually available solutions to my knowledge are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>generating 3 hierarchies of classes so define A, A2, A3, B, B2, B3 that will become a hell to maintain</li>\n<li>using a non OOP approach in which in A::method() I just use an if/else to change implementation according to the specific kind (which defeats OOP)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I never used templates for something else than trivial situation so I don't really know if they may help me but they sound more suitable for parametric polymorphism which is not directly this case.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also open to solutions that are not so ortodox if they allow me to keep things enough simple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:\nThe specific case is that I'm working on a multiplayer game for which I have already everything set up for single player. The set of classes represent the dynamic entities which are involved in the game and they are customized entities with customized behavior.\nTo manage the multiplayer I need to differentiate them because Entities which reside on server will do more things compared to entities which reside on client but many of these behavior will be kept common. For example I have a <code>stopMe</code> method which should do something on the server but something else on the client while the rest remains the same. At the same time while playing locally <code>stopMe</code> just stops the entity while on server it must also generate a packet for clients and so on.</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","multithreading","class","inheritance","initialization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":1,"question_id":13187762,"title":"Python threading override init","body":"<p>I am using threading.py and I have the following code:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>import threading  \nclass MyClass(threading.Thread):  \n    def __init__(self,par1,par2):\n       threading.Thread.__init__(self)  \n       self.var1 = par1  \n       self.var2 = par2  \n    def run(self):\n       #do stuff with var1 and var2 while conditions are met\n... \n... \n... \nmyClassVar = MyClass(\"something\",0.0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I get the following error:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>18:48:08    57  S E myClassVar = MyClass(\"something\",0.0)  \n18:48:08    58  S E File \"C:\\Python24\\Lib\\threading.py\", line 378, in `__init__`  \n18:48:08    59  S E assert group is None, \"group argument must be None for now\"  \n18:48:08    60  S E AssertionError: group argument must be None for now  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am kind of new using python, it is the first time I use threading...</p>\n\n<p>What is the bug here?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan</p>\n"},{"tags":["python","class","methods"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":1,"question_id":13183501,"title":"staticmethod and recursion?","body":"<p>I have following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        baz=self.bar(10)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def bar(n):\n        if n==0:\n            return 'bar'\n        else:\n            return bar(n-1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>bar() as a recursive function it needs reference to itself.

For some strange reason DateTime does get this next one right:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$test = new DateTime('2012-10-29'); // Monday\necho $test-&gt;modify('Sunday this week')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');  // 2012-11-04\n\n// But...\n\n$test = new DateTime('2012-11-04'); // Sunday\necho $test-&gt;modify('Monday this week')-&gt;format('Y-m-d');  // 2012-11-05 instead of 2012-10-29   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I think I can make the question clearer:\n<strong>Can the DateTime() class be used with monday as the first day of the week. If not, can the class be extended to use monday as the first day of the week.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nOk, I think I'm getting somewhere... I'm not a pro at coding classes..but this seems to work for the weeks. But it still needs rules for first day, second day... and also for the day name Sunday itself. I don't think this is foolproof.

These special classes are dynamically compiled and stored in a byte array inside MyClassLoader. When the MyClassLoader is asked for a class, it first checks if its <code>specialClasses</code> dictionary contains it, before delegating to the System classloader. It looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n    Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; specialClasses;\n\n    public MyClassLoader(Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; sb) {\n        this.specialClasses = sb;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {\n        if (specialClasses.containsKey(name)) return findClass(name);\n        else return super.loadClass(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class findClass(String name) {\n        byte[] b = specialClasses.get(name);\n        return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);\n    }    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I want to perform transformations (e.g. instrumentation) on the <code>specialClasses</code>, I can do so simply by modifying the <code>byte[]</code> before i call <code>defineClass()</code> on it. </p>\n\n<p>I would also like to transform the classes which are provided by the System classloader, but the System classloader doesn't seem to provide any way of accessing the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes it provides, and gives me the <code>Class</code> objects directly. </p>\n\n<p>I could use a <code>-javaagent</code> instrument all classes loaded into the JVM, but that would add overhead to the classes which I do not want to instrument; I only really want the classes loaded by MyClassLoader to be instrumented.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any way of retrieving the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes provided by the parent classloader, so I can instrument them before defining my own copy? </li>\n<li>Alternately, is there any way of emulating the functionality of the System classloader, in terms of where it grabs it's <code>byte[]</code>s from, so that MyClassLoader can instrument and define its own copy of all the System classes (Object, String, etc.)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>So I tried another approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using a <code>-javaagent</code>, Capture the <code>byte[]</code> of every class that is loaded and store it in a hashtable, keyed by the name of the class.</li>\n<li>MyClassLoader, instead of delegating the system classes to its parent classloader, would instead load their bytecode from this hashtable using the class name and define it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In theory this would let MyClassLoader define its own version of the system classes with instrumentation.

And it's work much better, both in performance and readability.</p>\n\n<p>So I am trying to implement it in Java. </p>\n\n<p>the main Idea of this pattern is that you are working with objects instead of types, saving by this the time to find the \"Dispatcher\" class to handle your event dispatch.(Dispatching event is sending event to all the listeners)</p>\n\n<p>So lets jump into the code:\nIn this sample I will create AlarmManager and handle his alarm event.</p>\n\n<p>First we need to create our Interface for this event</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IAlarmEvent {\n    void alarmEventHandler(String alert);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the event itself:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AlarmEvent extends Signal&lt;IAlarmEvent&gt; implements IAlarmEvent {\n\n    public void alarmEventHandler(String alert) {\n        dispatch(\"alarmEventHandler\", alert);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is the AlarmManger:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class AlarmManager {\n\n    public final AlarmEvent alarmEvent = new AlarmEvent();\n\n    public void init(){\n        // Dispatching the event\n        alarmEvent.alarmEventHandler(\"Wake up\");\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is an Activity who is listening for this event:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity implements IAlarmEvent{\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n        AlarmManager alarmManager = new AlarmManager();\n        alarmManager.alarmEvent.addListener(this);\n\n        alarmManager.init();\n    }\n\n    public void alarmEventHandler(String alert) {\n        Log.d(\"MyLog\", \"Event : \" + alert);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is how I wrote the Signal class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class Signal&lt;T&gt; {\n    private LinkedHashMap&lt;T, T&gt; listeners = new LinkedHashMap&lt;T, T&gt;();\n\n    protected void dispatch(String methodName, Object...arguments){\n        Set&lt;T&gt; keySet = listeners.keySet();\n        if(keySet.size() == 0){\n            return;\n        }\n\n        Iterator&lt;T&gt; iterator = keySet.iterator();\n\n        Method method = null;\n        do{\n            T listener = iterator.next();\n            if(method == null){\n                try {\n                    Class&lt;?&gt;[] classes = new Class&lt;?&gt;[arguments.length];\n                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++){\n                        classes[i] = arguments[i].getClass();\n                    }\n                    method = listener.getClass().getMethod(methodName, classes);\n                } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n\n            try {\n                method.invoke(listener, arguments);\n            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n\n        }while(iterator.hasNext());\n    }\n\n    public void addListener(T listener) {\n        listeners.put(listener, listener);\n    }\n\n    public void removeListener(T listener) {\n        listeners.remove(listener);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This pattern is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fast - no need to search for type and trigger the eventDispatcher, it's done immediately.  </li>\n<li>have great readability - Just by looking at the class you know exactly what events he dispatch, and how each event looks like.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However it's not working well. If I am using primitives for my interface, the Signal fails to find the Method and invoke it. And I don't like the idea passing the Method name to the signal. Any Ideas how to improve this?

I am not quite sure how this is going to be used later in the game, but I figured if I could get it functioning with a list, then changing the list to a string or an array or whatever could be done quite easily later. Once I know how to call this string I should be able to modify the code for all the other strings and integers I have to call. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","mockito","arguments","matcher"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2066,"score":1,"question_id":7500312,"title":"Mockito match any class argument","body":"<p>Is there a way to match any class argument of the below sample routine?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n     public B method(Class&lt;? extends A&gt; a) {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I <strong>always</strong> return a <code>new B()</code> regardless of which class is passed into <code>method</code>?

After searching in a lot of sites and forums all this week I found the point of the problem I was having. The problem is that when I create a New MFC project in Visual C++, if I set the Application type as \"Dialog Based\" and let the respective dialog class derive from its default CDialogEx, then the problem shows immediately compiling and executing the program without modifying any of the code (I don't know if you could try this in your machine).</p>\n\n<p>2.-The wired behavior is that with the dialog window active, if I click on a free space in the task bar (and even in another not maximized window), then the borders (including the title bar) of the window of the dialog-based applications stays as \"focused\" (not-grayed), being that clicking on the task bar or in another window that does not cover completely my application window then my application window should kind of lose the focus.</p>\n\n<p>3.-I realize this after a lot of code, because I discovered this behavior using a CFileDialog class, because when I create (DoModal) a CFileDialog instance, then my application window loses the focus (gets \"grayed) when the file dialog opens (as should be) but when the file dialog finishes, the borders of my window stays grayed (which is not correct), and it stays that way until I minimize and restore my window, or I switch to another window and return to my window.</p>\n\n<p>4.-I discovered that the problem was in inheriting from the CDialogEx class, because I created a New project from scratch (as I described in paragraph 1), to see if it was me who modified something that made my program behave wrong, and it turns out that the new project behaves as I described in paragraph 2.</p>\n\n<p>5.-The good new is that I tried creating a new project but this time inheriting from CDialog instead of CDialogEx. And for my surprise is that this new program behaves correctly, I mean, the wired behavior described in paragraph 2 is no present in this new project. As I described in paragraph 3, another of my problems was with the file dialog (CFileDialog class), fortunately changing the code of my project to inherit from CDialog, instead of CDialogEx, solved this problem too. I mean, the problem was the CDialogEx class.</p>\n\n<p>6.-I decided to write this question and also provide the information that I discovered because when I was searching I saw much people in different forums having the same problem without getting a solution. I want to mention that I tried all the advises provided in the forums and, as for they, nothing worked for me.</p>\n\n<p>7.-As I said, one solution is to change the inheritance from CDialogEx to CDialog. But my question is if you know something I should do to make my program behave correctly under the CDialogEx class, because I prefer to use the new interfaces and not the old ones. I also want to know if you experiment the same problem as me in your visual studio or not.</p>\n\n<p>I hope my information and your answers are useful to others.\nThank you very much for your answers. </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","class","syntax","methods"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12900341,"title":"Best DRY Method for PHP methods 2 levels deep in a Class?","body":"<p>I am working inside of a large class that is one of the backbones of an application, we'll call this <code>myClass</code>.

As mainly a C# programmer, I'm used to declaring classes in a large scope, typically near the top of the file, outside any functions, and then constructing them when in use.</p>\n\n<p>After moving on to C++, the only way of replicating this is to have a default constructor, which is fine, but in some cases, I'd rather have a constructor which requires arguments than an argument-less default constructor.</p>\n\n<p>After searching around the internet for a solution, I've come across a few pieces of advice, which have their flaws:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Pointers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people have suggested to have a dynamic pointer in the desired scope, and then assign the pointer to point at the location of the class when constructed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>CClass* pClass = 0;\n\nint main()\n{\n    pClass = new CClass(1337);\n\n    delete pClass;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that you have to remember to delete the pointer afterwards, thus, static pointers are much more \"safe\". Also, I'm guessing there will be slight memory overhead doing this, albeit not much, due to having the pointer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Have a default construct anyway</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is sometimes recommended to have a default constructor anyway, which just zeros everything inside the class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CClass\n{\npublic:\n    CClass() : leetNumber(0) {}\n    CClass(int leetNumber) : leetNumber(leetNumber) {}\nprivate:\n    int leetNumber;\n};\n\n//Defaults leetNumber to 0 through default ctor\nCClass myClass;\n\nint main()\n{\n    myClass = CClass(1337);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what happens if you can't just zero everything inside the class? What if you have another class in there which cannot just be initialized to nothing? What will you do if the user tries to access a function inside the class without proper initialization of the members? (You could check for this, but I believe it would take too much code, especially if you have a lot of members).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Staying in a smaller, more local scope</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have been suggestions where people have said to stay in a small scope, pass the class as a reference to other functions that may need it, and construct as soon as they declare the class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class CClass\n{\npublic:\n    CClass(int leetNumber) : leetNumber(leetNumber) {}\n    int getLeetNumber() { return leetNumber; }\nprivate:\n    int leetNumber;\n};\n\nbool GetMuchNeededAmazingNumberFromClass(CClass&amp; myClass)\n{\n    if(myClass.getLeetNumber() == 1337)\n        return true;\n\n    return false;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    CClass myClass = CClass(1337);\n    if(!GetMuchNeededAmazingNumberFromClass(&amp;myClass);\n        return 1;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is good in the sense that you can see what function needs what, but I can imagine a function needing a lot of external classes having a massive amount of needed arguments.</p>\n\n<p>There are many more examples, but I cannot seem to find one that I can rely on, especially coming from a C# background, where this stuff is nice and easy.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate more on what I'm asking for - in C#, you can do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Program\n{\n    //See how I'm able to do this, without calling the ctor.\n    static AmazingClass amazing;\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        //And then call the constructor when I want.\n        amazing = new AmazingClass(1337);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows me to create the class without actually constructing it, this is what I'm looking for in C++.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","oop","class","multidimensional-array","scope"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":2,"question_id":12901636,"title":"Preserving PHP $this inside of foreach loop with ordered array of methods","body":"<p>I have the following PHP class which contains many other app-centric functions beside <code>my_new_iterative_function()</code> but when I enter the <code>foreach</code> the scope of <code>$this</code> (which I <em>need</em>) becomes invalid because of context.

I would like the same thing with the users class, so there is one $users object that all the classes can access, without having to create a new object every time I need to use something in the \"User\" class.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize if my question is not clear, and thanks in advance for any responses!!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everybody for the replies!</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","constructor","methods","instantiation"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1460,"score":1,"question_id":3098881,"title":"calling class method (with constructors) without object instantiation in php","body":"<p>Ive looked and tried but I can't find an answer. </p>\n\n<p>In PHP, is it possible to call a class' member function (when that class requires a constructor to receive parameters) without instantiating it as an object?</p>\n\n<p>A code example (which gives errors):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass Test {\n    private $end=\"\";\n\n    function __construct($value) {\n        $this-&gt;end=$value;\n    }\n\n    public function alert($value) {\n        echo $value.\" \".$this-&gt;end;\n    }\n}\n\n//this works:\n$example=new Test(\"world\");\n$example-&gt;alert(\"hello\");\n\n//this does not work:\necho Test(\"world\")::alert(\"hello\");\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","class","lambda","entities"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":4,"question_id":12814399,"title":"select an element from a custom column from a list","body":"<p>I am trying to implement Searching for a custom element in a list with  a custom column name using a webservice for JQgrid, but I am out of ideas I would appreciate any help on this.</p>\n\n<p>I can't copy my code here but, for example, I have an entity like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test\n{\n    public int ID {get; set;}\n    public string Name {get; set;}\n    public string Nationality {get; set;}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I created a function to return a list of this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static List &lt;Test&gt; getList()\n{\n    List&lt;Test&gt; testList = new List&lt;Test&gt;();\n    Test testList1 = new Test();\n\n    testList1.ID = 123;\n    testList1.Name = \"asd\";\n    testList1.Nationality = \"qwe\";\n\n    testList.Add(testList1);\n    return testList;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and from the querystring I get the searchField and searchString, I have stored these values in strings searchField and searchString.</p>\n\n<p>I want something to work similar to this function (I know its wrong but I want that functionality):</p>\n\n<pre><code>list=testList.Where(x=&gt;x.searchField.Contains(searchString));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have no problem with getting the list or anything but I just want something similar to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","templates","arguments","main"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":12812840,"title":"Template Classes and main","body":"<p>I have the following class setup that trys mimicks a very basic stack.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;\nclass Stack{\n    public:\n        static const unsigned MAX_STACK_DEPTH =4;\n        Stack();\n        unsigned elements() const;\n        Stack&lt;T&gt; &amp; push(T &amp;value);\n        T pop();\n        Stack&lt;T&gt; &amp; show();\n    private:\n        unsigned element;\n        T stack[MAX_STACK_DEPTH];\n};\n\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nStack&lt;T&gt;::Stack(){\n    element=0;\n}\n/*Other class function definitions*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that I'm getting the following error in main</p>\n\n<pre><code>1   IntelliSense: no instance of function template \"calc\" matches the argument list c:\\users\\nima\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\projects\\calcu\\calcu\\policalc.cpp    109 6   Calcu\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my main</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(){\n    bool run=true;\n    while(run){\n        if(calc(input()));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>here are the other two functions declarations</p>\n\n<pre><code>string input();\ntemplate &lt;class T&gt;\nbool calc(string line);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is my calc function, It's not finished.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;\nbool calc(string line){\n    static T Ans;\n    istringstream sin(line);\n    Stack stack;\n    for(string token; sin&gt;&gt;token){\n        T t;\n        if(parse(t, token)){\n            push(t);\n        }else{\n            if(token==operators[i]){\n                switch(i){\n                case 1:{\n\n                       }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["c#",".net","class","variables","methods"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":12811903,"title":"Class Variables and Methods not Available to other class","body":"<p>I am getting this problem.

I'm just learning how to build scripts that use classes... and am a relative newbie to Python/coding. </p>\n\n<p>In principle, I'm interested to know if there is a way of calling the same func twice in a class. If I briefly explain what I am trying to do it might make some sense... </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to write a web 'scraper' that parses a seeded webpage, returns URLs based on some given parameters, follows those URLs, does the same thing (potentially n times) and finally returns a pdf at the bottom of the link. This is for speeding up some content collecting my colleagues currently do manually. (I have saved literal person months of manual effort with my relatively basic previous iterations.)</p>\n\n<p>This is a method I currently use, but the code I wrote is not really scaleable or easily reusable, and I want to try and make it more versatile (I'm currently hand rolling the script for each instance). </p>\n\n<p>(I think) I want to build a class called siteInstance that I use to hold the seed url, save locations, titles, u:p, cookie and the various funcs. that I use to walk through the site to get to the target content. </p>\n\n<p>There is a repeated function I use that parses the target URL and returns the next layer URLs. These are based on some site specific RegEx, so I know I will have to feed the search filter (regEx) for each layer of URLs. I would like to be able to reuse the parser, but feed it with the layer specific Regex. DRY is a thing right? </p>\n\n<p>In my mind, this means I have a func called siteInstance.parser, that I construct a number of within each siteInstance.class (e.g. <code>siteInstance.parserA</code> for layer one, <code>siteInstance.parserB</code> for layer two ... <code>siteInstance.parsern</code> for the nth layer)   </p>\n\n<p>Follows is a simplified version, in reality there is a number of cleaning/preparation steps at each layer to result in the correct generation of a list of target URLs for the next layer.

Apart from that, a C++ compiler treats a struct the same way it would treat a class. Structs could have constructors, copy constructors, virtual functions. etc. And the memory layout of a struct is same ad that of a class. And the reason C++ has structs is for backwward compatibility with C. </p>\n\n<p>Now since people confuse as to which one to use, struct or class, the rule of thumb is if you have just plain old data, use a struct. Otherwise use a class. And I have read that structs are good in serialization but don't where this comes from.</p>\n\n<p>Then the other day I came across this article: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/468882/Introduction-to-a-Cplusplus-low-level-object-model\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/468882/Introduction-to-a-Cplusplus-low-level-object-model</a></p>\n\n<p>It says that if we have (directly quoting):</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct SomeStruct\n{ \n    int    field1;\n    char   field2;\n    double field3;\n    bool   field4; \n};  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SomeStruct someStructVariable;\n    // usage of someStructVariable\n    ... \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{ \n    int    field1;\n    char   field2;\n    double field3;\n    bool   field4;      \n    // usage of 4 variables\n    ... \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are the same.</p>\n\n<p>It says the machine code generated is the same if we have a struct or just write down the variables inside the function. Now of course this only applies if your struct if a POD.</p>\n\n<p>This is where I get confused. In Effective C++ Scott Meyers says that there no such thing as an empty class.</p>\n\n<p>If we have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EmptyClass { };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is actually laid out by the compiler for example as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class EmptyClass\n{\n    EmptyClass() {}\n    ~EmptyClass() {}\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So you would not have an empty class.</p>\n\n<p>Now if we change the above struct to a class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class SomeClass\n{ \n    int  field1;\n    char field2 \n    double field3;\n    bool  field4; \n}; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does it mean that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{\n    someClass someClassVariable;\n    // usage of someClassVariable\n    ... \n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void SomeFunction()\n{ \n    int  field1;\n    char field2 \n    double field3;\n    bool  field4;      \n    // usage of 4 variables\n    ... \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are the same in terms of machine instructions? That there is no call to someClass constructor? Or that the memory allocated is the same as instantiating a class or defining the variables individually? And what about padding? structs and classes do padding. Would padding be the same in these cases?</p>\n\n<p>I'd really appreciate if somebody can shed some light on to this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","algorithm","class","scheduler","greedy"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":0,"question_id":12775993,"title":"PHP Class Scheduler","body":"<p>I've been working on a class scheduler for our university as part of our class. \nI would just like to ask if PHP or any other framework is appropriate for this?\nWe aim to use Ext JS or HTML5 for the front end coding and PHP for the back end.\nCan someone point me in the right direction?</p>\n\n<p>The database looks like this. and business rules looks like this</p>\n\n<p>Schedules[x] runs 30 minutes per row then it will be compiled to 2 or more to form 1 class schedule \nThe meta data are:\nClass:      Faculty in charge:      Room:       Time:    Course:</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking of using greedy algorithm implemented in PHP.

However, I also have a function, that is supposed to create a new card and return it to the user, this function is now broken.</p>\n\n<p>The original command:  <code>card = newCard();</code> isn't available anymore, and <code>card = new CCard();</code> doesn't work. What other options do I have? I have a feeling using the constructor won't work, and that I probably should just create a class method newCard, but I want to see if it is somehow at all possible to do it the way the teacher wanted. </p>\n\n<p>This is creating a lot of headaches for me. I told the teacher that this is a stupid idea and not everything has to be classed in OOP. He has since told me that Java or C# don't allow code outside of classes, which sounds a little incredible. Not sure that you can do this in C++, especially when templated functions exist, or generic algorithms. Is it true that this would be bad code for OOP in C++ if I didn't force it into a class? </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank everyone for their helpful answers! However, I believe that my phrasing of the question is a little screwed up, and I think people don't understand what I am looking for. </p>\n\n<p>I do <em>not</em> want to initialize another member of type CCard. I want to intitialize</p>\n\n<p><code>CCard card</code> once and then give <code>card</code> new values through the constructor, because this is what the teacher told me to do. I do not want to create a new CCard object, just use the same variable with new values over again.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I said it probably won't work with the constructor. So I have a function that is supposed to take the initialized variable <code>card</code> and then call the constructor again( \"What?\" is what I told the teacher ) and then give it new values.</p>\n\n<p>Example code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo()\n{\n    /* Initialize card with constructor */\n    CCard card;\n    /* Give it new values through the constructor AGAIN... */\n    card;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the actual question. I'm sorry if I confused everybody xD</p>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","class","nsstring"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12693956,"title":"NSString between classes","body":"<p>I need to pass a NSString between two Classes (from ViewController Class_A to ViewController Class_B) of my app, I have searched on StackOverflow but this is the simplified code of my situation:</p>\n\n<p>Class_A.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"Class_B.h\"\n\n@interface ViewController : UIViewController {\n    NSString *stringToPass;\n}\n\n@property (retain, nonatomic) NSString *stringToPass;\n-(NSString *)stringPassage:(id)sender;\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_A.m</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (NSString *)stringPassage:(id)sender{\n    NSString *string = @\"A FANTASTIC STRING!\"; //here I define string INTO the - (NSString *) method\n    NSLog(@\"String to pass: %@\",string);\n    return string;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_B.h</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"Class_A.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Class_B.m</p>\n\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n\n    Class_A *Class_A_Instance = [[Class_A alloc] init];\n    NSString *importedString = [Class_A_Instance stringPassage:self];\n    [Class_A_Instance release];\n\n    NSLog(@\"Received String: %@\",importedString);\n\n    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, it works like a charm!

I learned AutoHotkey script, a bunch of c# and some or c++. My question is not language or syntax specific, but more of a concept. I'll start by explaining the situation (any code should be interpreted similar to psuedo code).</p>\n\n<p>My latest project is an instant messenger sort of program, with a server and a client. They work as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Server</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assign client info into 3 different arrays (I don't like this)\n<ul>\n<li>NewConnection[skt], userNick[nick], nickFromSocket[skt]</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Client</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Send messages to the server > server receives > server responds > client receives\nand logs messages to chat log.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You probably have already noticed that the array 'userNick' uses the users actual nickname in replace of the traditional index number (userNick[index]). This is important and works like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// New user has connected\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nNewConnection[skt]  // Simple to parse with a loop: NewConnection.MaxIndex()\n\n// Receive new user's nickname\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nnick = WINSOCK_getNick()\nuserNick[nick]      = nick\nnickFromSocket[skt] = nick\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The theory behind assigning the user's nickname twice is to avoid using a loop to parse the arrays. This is simple and can be achieved because when the client sends a message to the server, the server can see the socket number (which is unique to each user), with that variable, I can instantly get the user's nickname from 2 short lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Get user's nickname\nskt  = WINSOCK_getSkt()\nnick = nickFromSocket[skt]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope everything is clear till now. </p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How can I convert all this to a class, yet retain the speed of getting data from an array?

All classes have to share some indexing features, but also all of them define a lot of properties. The properties are defined on class level with descriptors, to be able to intercept writing to them for validation and check for duplicates in the DB. For this, every class has a list of the automatically maintained properties, <code>_properties</code>. They also hold <code>_indices</code> and some other features, which I don't want to copy on my own to every single Element-class (about 10 or so). </p>\n\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class BaseElement(object):\n    _properties = None\n\nclass ElementFlavour1(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n....\n\nclass ElementFlavourN(BaseElement):\n    _properties = 'e', 'f', 'g'\n\nfor item in locals():\n    if issubclass(item, BaseElement):\n        item._v_properties_set = set(item._properties) if item._properties else set()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it basically does what it should do: I need to iterate the <code>_properties</code> linearly, but I also want to do quick lookups, if some property is present in a class.

E.g. subclasses of <code>BaseElement</code> in other modules wouldn't get their properties set right.

That looks fine now for this simplified code, but the function parse_file has quite a few levels of indention as well. I'd prefer to define the function parse_file() as a class function like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClass():\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        self.filename = filename \n\n        self.stat1 = None\n        self.stat2 = None\n        self.stat3 = None\n        self.stat4 = None\n        self.stat5 = None\n        parse_file()\n\n    def parse_file():\n        #do some parsing\n        self.stat1 = result_from_parse1\n        self.stat2 = result_from_parse2\n        self.stat3 = result_from_parse3\n        self.stat4 = result_from_parse4\n        self.stat5 = result_from_parse5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course this code doesn't work because the function <code>parse_file()</code> is not within the scope of the <strong>init</strong> function. Is there a way to call a class function from within <strong>init</strong> of that class? Or am I thinking about this the wrong way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class","forward-declaration","friend-class"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":324,"score":4,"question_id":9890756,"title":"How come forward declaration is not needed for friend class concept?","body":"<p>I've just recently learned about <code>friend class</code> concept in C++ (I've googled around for a bit, but this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/437507/884412\">answer</a> made me laugh until I remembered the  most important parts), and I'm trying to incorporate it in to the project I'm working on right now. The concise question is singled out in the end, but in general, I'm confused by <em>complete lack of forward declarations</em> in my working code.</p>\n\n<p>All of my classes are separated through (sub-)folders and each one into a separate <em>.h</em> and <em>.cpp</em> file, but this should be enough to get a feeling about dependencies:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// FE.h - no implementations - no .cpp file\nclass FE\n{\n    private:\n       virtual void somePrivateFunc() = 0;\n    // 90% virtual class, interface for further implementations\n    friend class TLS;\n};\n\n// DummyFE.h\n#include \"FE.h\"\nclass DummyFE :: public FE {\n    /* singleton dummy */\n    private:\n        // constructor\n    public:\n        static DummyFE&amp; instance();\n};\n// DummyFE.cpp\n#include \"DummyFE.h\"\n// all Dummy FE implementation\n\n// ImplFE.h\n#include \"FE.h\"\nclass ImplFE :: public FE { /* implemented */ };\n// ImplFE.cpp\n#include \"FE.cpp\"\n// all Impl FE implementations\n\n\n// SD.h - implements strategy design pattern\n//        (real project has more than just FE class in here)\n#include \"FE.h\"\n#include \"DummyFE.h\"\nclass SD\n{\n    private:\n        FE &amp;localFE;\n    public:\n        SD(FE &amp;paramFE = DummyFE::instance());\n    // ... and all the other phun stuff ... \n    friend class TLS;\n};\n// SD.cpp - implementations\n# include \"SD.h\"\n/* SD implemented */\n\n// TLS.h - implements strategy design pattern\n           (on a higher level)\n#include SD.h\nclass TLS{\n    private:\n        SD *subStrategy;\n    public:\n        void someFunctionRequiringFriendliness();\n}\n\n// TLS.cpp - implementations\n#include \"TLS.h\"\nvoid TLS::someFunctionRequiringFriendliness(){\n    this-&gt;subStrategy-&gt;localFE.somePrivateFunc(); // ok!\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I've had party getting all of this to actually compile with all the dependencies (had to write it down in to a class diagram in the end to make it work), but now it does. The fact that is actually <em>confusing me</em>, is that <em>no forward declarations were needed</em>. I know about forward declarations from before, and just in case, I refreshed my memory with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/553869/884412\">this answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, to try and keep it clear, <strong>my question</strong>:\nWhen declaring the <code>class TLS</code> as a friend, how come no explicit forward declarations were needed? Does that mean that a <code>friend class</code> declaration is a forward declaration all in it self? For me, intuitively, something here is missing... And since it compiles and works normally, can somebody help correct my intuition? :D</p>\n\n<p>PS sorry for such a lengthy introduction to the question and a bunch of code. Please, don't comment on my code concept - friends are good here, I'm pretty sure it's correct for my current project (it's just a bit hard to see from this skeleton). I'd just like to know why no forward declaration was needed anywhere.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","class","search","html-lists"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":66,"score":0,"question_id":12643206,"title":"How to fetch list items by class from one page to another?","body":"<p>This is a continuation of a previous question, and I tried the previous method and I'm unsure if I did it correctly, or if it performs the intended function.

a read-only property.</li>\n<li>Pages.add(<em>key</em>, <em>value</em>) : is a function that will do an add like an associative array</li>\n<li>Pages.getByKey(<em>key</em>) : is a function that will return the value associated with the key</li>\n<li>Pages.getByIndex(<em>index</em>) : is a function that will return the value associated with the index</li>\n<li>Pages.removeAll() : is a function that will remove all the key-value pairs and therefore the length will be zero.</li>\n<li>Pages.removeByKey(<em>key</em>) : is a function that will remove the corresponding key-value pair </li>\n<li>Pages.removeByIndex(<em>index</em>) : is a function that will remove the corresponding key-value pair </li>\n<li>a constructor</li>\n<li>Pages.createFrom(<em>files</em>) : returns an instance of Pages object that will automatically create based on the files object as stated in the link above.</li>\n<li>Pages.indexExists(<em>index</em>) : returns boolean if there is such an index</li>\n<li>Pages.keyExists(<em>key</em>) : returns bookean if there is such a key-value pair</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most important characteristics are that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>whenever I add new key-value pair, it will be appended to the end of the Pages object.</li>\n<li>the key-value pair can be accessed by either the key using .getByKey(<em>key</em>) or the  .getByIndex(<em>index</em>) E.g., the first key-value pair can be accessed by index 0.</li>\n<li>whenever any existing key-value pair is removed or added, <strong>the length property is updated AND the indices are updated as well.</strong> E.g., if there are 5 key-value pairs and I remove the 2nd one, the 3rd key-value pair now can be accessed using the index 1 and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I do not need code for the various functions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I just need a skeleton structure of creating the above custom object class in javascript</strong></p>\n\n<p>I read <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6412589/set-length-property-of-javascript-object\">Set length property of JavaScript object</a> and thought I need to do it as a function.</p>\n\n<p>But then

However, tonight while working on the site I had encountered a really confusing problem and narrowed it down to that global declaration.  When I remove the global declaration, the other (more serious) problem goes away, but then I get the warning.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","jvm","classloader"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":54,"score":2,"question_id":12596527,"title":"What happens if import statements can not be resolved?","body":"<p>I am not clear on the following:<br>\nA class is loaded by JVM when needed, like lazy initialization, right?<br>\nNow if class <code>A</code> does an <code>import</code> of class <code>B</code> which class <code>B</code> actually is not in the file system (e.g. <code>B.class</code> was deleted or not delivered or any reason)<br>\nthen does class <code>A</code> get loaded and runs <strong>if</strong> no method of class <code>B</code> is called?<br>\n<em>Or</em> class <code>A</code> is not able to run at all since the imports can not be resolved?<br>\n<em>Or</em> class <code>A</code> is loaded and run up to a certain point?  </p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","class","asp.net-4.0"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":39,"score":1,"question_id":12632055,"title":"this.QueryString (NameValueCollection) access Form1 - from another class","body":"<p>i have made a helper Method using it to modify Query Strings, for testing and debugging</p>\n\n<p>the only problem now is that i would like to make it as a Class in my \nC# collection helper-class </p>\n\n<p>the method is working perfectly now , but as i am still \"fresh\" .net developer</p>\n\n<p>i couldn't figure out how to use \n<code>this.Request.QueryString</code> to access current <code>partial class</code> - form (form1) \nvalues when it's inside a separated public static or non static class </p>\n\n<p>this is the code , you're free to use it (:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void QsModify(string action, string NewP_Value, string CurQS_ParamName, string         NewQs_paramName=null, bool redirectWithNewQuerySettings=false)\n{\n\n#region &lt;&lt;=========== reflect to readonly &amp; set QueriString ReadOnly - false ============&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n// reflect to readonly property \nPropertyInfo isReadOnly = typeof(System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection).GetProperty(\"IsReadOnly\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\n\n// make collection editable \nisReadOnly.SetValue(this.Request.QueryString, false, null);\n\n#endregion\nswitch (action)\n{\n    case ModAQs_Remove:\n        if (notEmptyQs()) \n        this.Request.QueryString.Remove(CurQS_ParamName);\n        break;\n    case ModAQs_Replace:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Remove(CurQS_ParamName);\n        this.Request.QueryString.Add(NewQs_paramName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n    case ModAQs_EditValue:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Set(CurQS_ParamName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n\n    case ModAQs_Add:\n        this.Request.QueryString.Add(NewQs_paramName, NewP_Value);\n        break;\n\n}\n\n\n#region &lt;&lt;=========== joining Full Path &amp; queryString then Redirection  ============&gt;&gt;\n\n\nstring seperator = \"?\";\nUrlPath = Request.Url.AbsolutePath;\nUrlPathAndQuery = string.Join(seperator, UrlPath, this.Request.QueryString);\nisReadOnly.SetValue(this.Request.QueryString, true, null);\n\nif (redirectWithNewQuerySettings)\n{\n\n    Response.Redirect(UrlPathAndQuery);\n}\n#endregion\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how do i make it into a class that will be able to access any project i am working on \nnot knowing what the form name will be </p>\n"},{"tags":["c++","class"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":12631628,"title":"C2365 and C2063 Class error","body":"<p>I'm trying to code a basic elevator simulation for a college course using classes.
