In other words, my application is built entirely around events. I find this kind of architecture working extremely well for me, with the exception of one side case which I will describe here.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I do not think knowledge of Node.js is required to answer this question. Therefore I will try to keep it abstract.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the following situation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A global event emitter (called <code>mediator</code>) allows individual modules to listen for application-wide events.</li>\n<li>A HTTP Server is created, accepting incoming requests.</li>\n<li>For each incoming request, an event emitter is created to deal with events specific to this request</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An example (purely to illustrate this question) of an incoming request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediator.on('http.request', request, response, emitter) {\n\n    //deal with the new request here, e.g.:\n    response.send(\"Hello World.\");\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So far, so good. One can now extend this application by identifying the requested URL and emitting appropriate events:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediator.on('http.request', request, response, emitter) {\n\n    //identify the requested URL\n    if (request.url === '/') {\n        emitter.emit('root');\n    }\n    else {\n        emitter.emit('404');\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Following this one can write a module that will deal with a root request.</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediator.on('http.request', function(request, response, emitter) {\n\n    //when root is requested\n    emitter.once('root', function() {\n\n        response.send('Welcome to the frontpage.');\n\n    });\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Seems fine, right? Actually, it is <strong>potentially broken</strong> code. The reason is that the line <code>emitter.emit('root')</code> may be executed before the line <code>emitter.once('root', ...)</code>. The result is that the listener never gets executed.</p>\n\n<p>One could deal with this specific situation by delaying the emission of the <code>root</code> event to the end of the event loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mediator.on('http.request', request, response, emitter) {\n\n    //identify the requested URL\n    if (request.url === '/') {\n        process.nextTick(function() {\n            emitter.emit('root');\n        });\n    }\n    else {\n        process.nextTick(function() {\n            emitter.emit('404');\n        });\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason this works is because the emission is now delayed until the current event loop has finished, and therefore all listeners have been registered.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are many issues with this approach:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>one of the advantages of such event based architecture is that emitting modules do not need to know who is listening to their events. Therefore it should not be necessary to decide whether the event emission needs to be delayed, because one cannot know what is going to listen for the event and if it needs it to be delayed or not.</li>\n<li>it significantly clutters and complexifies code (compare the two examples)</li>\n<li>it probably worsens performance</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As a consequence, my question is: how does one avoid the need to delay event emission to the next tick of the event loop, such as in the described situation? </p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html5","node.js","upload","compression"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":89,"score":5,"question_id":13271061,"title":"Compressing huge files (> 2GB) into ZIP on the client side","body":"<p>Im building an upload tool using <code>node.js</code> and <code>socket.io</code>, because they usually upload incredibly huge files and normal upload forms wouldnt work.

I started working on web-application programming just over a year ago, and thankfully discovered nodeJS, which made web-app creation feel a lot more like traditional programming. Now, I have a node.js app that I've been developing for some time that is now running in production on the web. <strong>My main confusion stems from the fact that I am very new to the world of the web development, and don't really know what's important and what isn't when it comes to monitoring my application.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I am using a Joyent SmartMachine, and looking at the analytics options that they provide is a little overwhelming.

I want to know if my application has the right amount of resources allocated to it. Does the number of requests that it receives make the server it's on overkill, or does it warrant extra resources? What is analytics are important to look at for a NodeJS app for that purpose? (using both MongoDB and Redis on separate servers if that makes a difference)</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h2>QUESTION TWO</h2>\n\n<p>What other statistics are generally really important to look at when managing a server that's in production? I'm used to programs that run once to do something specific (e.g. a raytracer that finishes running once it has computed an image), as opposed to web-apps which are continuously running and interacting with many clients. I'm sure there are many things that are obvious to long-time server administrators that aren't to newbies like me. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h2>QUESTION THREE</h2>\n\n<p>What's important to look at when dealing with NodeJS specifically?

What I want is setting fields on database-server-side. I just send something like null-fields, and db-server setting those for me using default mongo′s mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Inserting timestamps (as <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Timestamp+data+type\" rel=\"nofollow\">native MongoDB timestamp</a>) is also a problem, but it′s not such a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>PS: No luck going through mongoskin and <a href=\"https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mongodb-native</a> docs.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","architecture","game"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":51,"score":1,"question_id":13252063,"title":"Web game architecture","body":"<p>I am working on a web based game in JS (typescript), with a node.js server and AJAX.

This seems cleaner, makes the query reusable. However I'm not sure how to go about it or if it would still manifest the same problem.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, in a more extreme case, if you have a dozen queries to make, things might get ugly.

Without further ado:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dan's Perfect Framework</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Getting Started</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>npm install -g dan\ndan create singlePageApplication\ncd singlePageApplication\ndan\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now your application is serving on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.  Here's an overview of the structure, followed by an explanation of each folder:</p>\n\n<pre><code>singlePageApplication/\n    .build/\n    data/\n    scripts/\n        pages/\n            home.co\n        main.co\n    styles/\n        pages/\n            home.styl\n        main.styl\n    templates/\n        pages/\n            home.jade\n    app.co\n    main.jade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>app.co</code> configures and runs the project rendering the only server-side template which here is called main.jade</p>\n\n<p><code>main.jade</code> sets up the greatest common set of html that's shared by all client side pages in your application.  In this case, doctype, html/head/body structure, a templated title tag, requirejs with /scripts/main.co as the main entry point, and a stylesheet link to /styles/main.styl</p>\n\n<p><code>main.co</code> is the entrypoint that sets up client side routing by instantiating dan.Router.  The router loads the home page by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>creating a singleton of /scripts/pages/home.co which inherits from dan.Page</li>\n<li>which injects home.jade into index.jade, fetching it from the server if it hasn't been fetched yet.</li>\n<li>and includes /styles/pages/home.styl if it exists.  This also removes any other style definition that was dynamically added at the same level as home.styl (not by templates that are added to home.jade)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>scripts/</code> is where javascript, coffeescript, coco, or whatever you choose to write your app logic in, go.  In the case of the basic app, main.co</p>\n\n<p><code>scripts/pages/*.co</code> deserves special mention because these inherit from dan.Page and are instantiated as singletons by dan.Router.  Navigation links can be created as <code>&lt;a class=\"navigate\" href=\"#somePage\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags and are handled by the router which instantiates and/or runs scripts/pages/somePage.co.  Navigation can be done programatically with dan.Router.go('somePage').  The pages hang on to their state because they're singletons but can also store it to localStorage to handle the user refreshing the browser.</p>\n\n<p><code>styles/</code> is where css, styl, less, or any other style definition files go.</p>\n\n<p><code>templates/</code> is where html, jade, haml, or any other markup files go.</p>\n\n<p><code>data/</code> is where javascript objects are saved to the database mechanism of choice.  By default, <code>dan</code> stores objects to the filesystem.

I have a node.js application that takes messages from one source (a socket.io client), and then does processing on the message, which might result in zero or more messages back out, either to the sender, or other clients within that group.</p>\n\n<p>For the processing, I would like to essentially just shove the message into a queue, then it works its way through various message processors that might kick off their own items, and eventually, the bit running socket.io is informed \"Hey, send this message back\"</p>\n\n<p>As a concrete example, say a user signs into the service, that sign in message is then placed in the queue, where the authorization processor gets it, does it's thing, then places a message back in the queue saying the client's been authorized. This goes back to the socket.io socket that is connected to the client, along with other clients that might be interested. It can also go to other subsystems that might want to do more processing on authorization (looking up user info, sending more info to the client based on their data, etc).</p>\n\n<p>If I wanted strong coupling, this would be easy, but I tried that before, and it just goes to a mess of spaghetti code that's very fragile, and I would like to avoid that. Another wrench in the setup is this should be cluster-able, which is where the real problem comes in. There might be more than one, say, authorization processor running. But the authorization message should be processed only once.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, I'm looking for a pattern/technique that will allow me to, essentially, have multiple \"groups\" of subscribers for a message, and the message will be processed only once per group.</p>\n\n<p>I thought about maybe having each instance of a processor generate a unique name that would be used as a list in Reids. This name would then be registered with some sort of dispatch handler, and placed into a set for that group of subscribers. Then when a message arrives, the dispatch pulls a random member out of that set, and places it into that list. While it seems like this would work, it seems somewhat over-complicated and fragile. </p>\n\n<p>The core problem is I've never designed a system like this, so I'm not even sure the proper terms to use or look up. If anyone can point me in the right direction for this, I would be most appreciative. </p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1364,"score":6,"question_id":10058814,"title":"Get data from fs.readFile","body":"<pre><code>    var content;\n    fs.readFile('./Index.html', function read(err, data) {\n        if (err) {\n            throw err;\n        }\n        content = data;\n    });\n    console.log(content);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Error: content is undefined.

The setup seems to work great and I've researched all the\nsuggested methodologies such that I believe the setup is solid. We're\nrunning node.js 0.8.1 with Express 2.5.11 and XMLHttpRequest 1.4.2.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the issue: We're doing a \"dark launch\" test of this product\n(i.e. the browser client code has javascript ajax calls to our APIs in\nthe background, but is not used on the page or shown to the user).  After a few minutes running successfully, the system is throwing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We're catching the error with the 'uncaughtException' event in the\ncluster controller (which starts each worker), however there is no\nstack trace available at that level.  I've done extensive research on\nthis issue and can't seem to find anyone with a similar error.  After\ncombing through EVERY line of code in the system, here's what I know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I cannot find any recursion or circular references.  (I've read that\nthis error doesn't always mean a recursion problem, but we've checked;\nwe've actually run tests by removing most of the code anyways and it\nstill happens, see below);</li>\n<li>I've gone down to 1 worker process per box to try and eliminate the\ncluster as an issue -- the problem still happens;</li>\n<li>The problem ONLY happens under high load.  Our traffic is approx.\n1500 pages per second and, during heavy traffic times, can reach 15000\npages per second (we haven't been able to replicate on a dev\nenvironment);</li>\n<li>The timing of the error being caught varies, but is usually within 15 minutes;</li>\n<li>The error does NOT seem to impact operation!  By this, I mean that\nthere are no corrupt responses and, aside from the occasional timeout,\nthe system never crashes;</li>\n<li>The worker process that traps the error recovers and starts serving\nrequests again after a few seconds;</li>\n<li>I have gotten the error to happen on the most basic design--no\nadditional APIs are called.  Simply take a request and respond with a\nsimple json response.  This is the most curious part.  It doesn't seem\nlike the system is failing in any of my code -- It's failing without\ninstantiating any of the classes to do the <em>real</em> work.  Obviously, I\nstarted out with more code, but slowly took out pieces until it was\nstill failing under a bare-bones setup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most telling symptom, I believe, is that the error always happens\nAFTER a request has been fully served.  That is, the server takes a\nrequest, finds the proper Express route, calls res.send, and is\nfinished.  This really feels like garbage collection to me!

I have read in Addy Osmani Javascript patterns about interfaces, although my implementation was not the same, and although interface usage is acceptable, it is probably not needed.</p>\n\n<p>It might be simpler to keep the strategy approach but with a different implementation, one that is outlined in Javascript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov, where you have one implementation and based on some form of configuration you know which strategy to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pseudo Sample</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>QueryBuilder = function () {\n   this.types = [];\n}\n\nQueryBuilder.prototype.create = function (type, query) {\n    var strategy = types[type];\n    strategy.create(query);\n};\n\nQueryBuilder.types.Select = {\n\n    create: function (query) {\n        params = query.parameters,\n        paramList = query.parameters.length &gt;= 1 ?

I stuck with the strategy-ish approach in that every strategy defined the same function(s), essentially encapsulating what varied across the implementations and giving them a common contract for want of a better term.  </p>\n\n<p>One thing that changed was the base class/interface which, as correctly pointed was not doing anything constructive was removed, each strategy is independent (so not 100% in the classical representation of the pattern) they, as stated just define the same create function.</p>\n\n<p>From the place where the nested ifs and switches once belonged has been replaced with a single switch which decides which query strategy to use based on the type of query type requested.  This could be re-factored into a factory later on, but for now it serves its purpose:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Query.prototype.generate = function () {\n\nvar self = this,\n    strategy = undefined;\n\nswitch (this.queryType) {\n    case \"SELECT\":\n        strategy = new Select(self);\n        break;\n    case \"INSERT\":\n        strategy = new Insert(self);\n        break;\n    case \"UPDATE\":\n        strategy = new Update(self);\n        break;\n    case \"DELETE\":\n        strategy = new Delete(self);\n        break;\n}\n\nreturn strategy.create();\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each strategy is independently tested, and i feel this is easier to maintain as if something fails, it will fail in one place and investigation will be easier based on the unit tests.  Obviously there is a trade off, more files, and a slightly more complex structure...we will see what happens.</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","session","expressjs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":1,"question_id":13158719,"title":"How can I do something right before the session expire(destroy)","body":"<p>Hi I am using <code>expressjs</code> for my web application, and I use the <code>session</code> middleware, my question is that how I can do something right before the session expire?</p>\n\n<p>For example, I store something in the session, and I set the <code>req.session.cookie.maxAge</code> to 60000(1 minute), when the session timeout, I want to save the data in the session to disk, how I can do this?

I load the coffeescript source into the node environment to simulate the browser <code>window</code> using vm.createContext:</p>\n\n<pre><code>vm = require 'vm'\nfs = require 'fs'\ncoffee = require 'coffee-script'\nbackboneDualstoragePath = './backbone.dualstorage.coffee'\nsource = fs.readFileSync(backboneDualstoragePath, 'utf8')\nwindow = require('./global_test_context.coffee').window\ncontext = vm.createContext window\ncoffee.eval source, sandbox: context, filename: backboneDualstoragePath\nexports.window = context\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works great - in my tests, I can access <code>window.foo</code>, where foo is an attribute exported on the window object in global_test_context.coffee.</p>\n\n<p>I can use Jasmine spies on and redefine methods on any object nested under the window sandbox. Eg:</p>\n\n<pre><code>spyOn(window.Store.prototype, 'create').andReturn(true)\nwindow.Store.create() # The spy is called\nwindow.localsync.create() # This function instantiates a Store object and calls create on it\n                          # The spy is called\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However if I try to spy on or otherwise modify the context's direct attributes, the change is not seen inside the sandbox context:</p>\n\n<pre><code>spyOn(window, 'localsync').andReturn(true)\nwindow.localsync() # The spy is called\nwindow.dualsync() # This function references the global localsync\n                  # The original localsync is called\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_vm_createcontext_initsandbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">vm.createContext documentation</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A (V8) context comprises a global object together with a set of\n  build-in objects and functions. The optional argument initSandbox\n  <em>will be shallow-copied to seed the initial contents of the global object</em> used by the context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it sounds like it copies the attributes from my window variable into the vm context. When I spy on or otherwise modify <code>window</code> after this point, I am working with the vm context, which I export as an attribute named <code>window</code>. Therefore I think that the paragraph above is irrelevant, but I wanted to include it in case I'm wrong.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p>The flow of events boils down to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>window = vm.createContext({globalVariables: forTesting...})\n\n# similiar to vm.runInContext(backboneDualstorageSource, window)\ncoffee.eval(backboneDualstorageSource, sandbox: window)\n\n# localsync and dualsync are both defined in the backboneDualstorageSource\nspyOn(window, 'localsync')\nwindow.dualsync() # calls the original localsync instead of the spy\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why is it that after modifying attributes on the vm context, references to those \"global\" attributes/functions inside the vm don't change? I want to understand this.</p>\n\n<p>How can I work around this so that I can modify/spyOn globals in the browser script I'm testing?</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to look at <a href=\"https://github.com/nilbus/Backbone.dualStorage/tree/tests/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">the source</a> to get a better idea of how things are actually written compared to the snippets in this question.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>I was able to work around this issue by creating the spy inside an eval that runs in the context, like the rest of the tested code.

Minor aggregations would be grouping things with metadata (how many percents used client1 vs. client2 etc.). All the aggregations will be system defined, so users can't set them by themselves, at this point at least. Thus, as far as I understand, the sharding should be done through ID, as big majority of the aggregations will be ID centric? Also, this should mean that the most recent events on any given ID are always in memory as Mongo keeps the latest stuff in memory and only dumps the overflow to disk.</p>\n\n<p>Also, real time is not a requirement.

The\n  client never sees the implementation and doesn’t personally modify the\n  data. The server does all the work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And following this advice, I implemented this in my code: </p>\n\n<p>Server-side: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Meteor.methods({\n\n  addMovie: function(data) {\n    var movie = Movies.insert({name: data});\n    return movie;\n  },\n\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Client-side: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Template.movies.events = ({\n\n  'click #add-movie': function(e) {\n\n    var name = document.getElementById('movie-name').value;\n    Meteor.call('addMovie', name);\n\n    return false;\n\n  }, \n\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works, but it's slow. The UI doesn't update instantly like it would if you called <code>Movies.insert()</code> on the client-side. The <a href=\"http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_methods\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs</a> indicate that, to rectify the problem, you can create stubs on the client-side: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Calling methods on the client defines stub functions associated with\n  server methods of the same name. You don't have to define a stub for\n  your method if you don't want to. In that case, method calls are just\n  like remote procedure calls in other systems, and you'll have to wait\n  for the results from the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But what should these stubs look like? Should it basically look the same as the server-side method? If so, what's the point?

If I were to have a static front end, that communicates with a node backend (to handle the DB queries, etc.) how should I design the front end?</p>\n\n<p>Any tips on how I should handle authentication?

Basically during a game, a player's browser should track realtime mouse input events and keep broadcasting them to all other players in the same game.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example, let's say my avatar follows around my mouse pointer on the screen, and it should be broadcasted to rest of the players on the screen in realtime. I would do something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// client side\n$(document).on(\"mousemove\", function(event){\n    io.emit(\"coordinate\", {x: event.pageX, y: event.pageY});\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and on the server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// server side\nio.sockets.on(\"connection\", function(socket){\n    ...\n    socket.on(\"coordinate\", function(coordinate){\n        socket.get(\"username\", function(err, username){\n            socket.broadcast.emit(\"move\", {username: username, coordinate:coordinate});\n        });\n    });\n    ...\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think this should work, but this requires the browser emitting several events per second to the server, which subsequently should broadcast them to rest of the players in the same game, and I am worried about the implication of this. One thing though is that the size of each fragment of data being transmitted is not that large (basically it's just an x and y coordinate). If this is too expensive, no matter how great this game is, I don't think I can ship it. Could anyone enlighten me? Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] To clarify, I am not asking about how to make this architecture more efficient.

I'm out of ideas, and am looking for new suggestions. This problem is killing the stability of my production servers and really needs to be resolved ASAP.</p>\n\n<p>To recap, the basic idea is that my node server(s) sometimes intermittently slow down, sometimes resulting in Gateway Timeouts. As best as I can tell from my logs, something is blocking the node thread (meaning that the incoming request is not accepted), but I cannot for the life of me figure out what. </p>\n\n<p><em>The problem ranges in severity</em>. Sometimes what should be &lt;100ms requests take ~10 seconds to complete; sometimes they never even get accepted by the node server at all. <strong>In short, it is as though some random task is working and blocking the node thread for a period of time, thus slowing down (or even blocking) incoming requests; the one thing I can say for sure is that the need-to-fix-symptom is a \"Gateway Timeout\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>The issue comes and goes without warning</em>. I have not been able to correlate it against CPU usage, RAM usage, uptime, or any other relevant statistic. I've seen the servers handle a large load fine, and then have this error with a small load, so it does not even appear to be load-related. It is not unusual to see the error around 1am PST, which is the smallest load time of the day!

The response is very consistent, no slow down.</p>\n\n<p>Something to do with # of concurrent threads that Node.js (http.request) can handle.  </p>\n\n<p>------------ <strong>More</strong> --------------</p>\n\n<p>I did more test today and here it is: \nI used http.Agent and increase the max socket.  However, the interesting this is that, on one testing server (EC2), it improves a lot and no more slow down.  HOwever, the other server (rackspace) only improves a bit.  It still shows slow down.  I even set \"Connection: close\" in the request header, it only improves 100ms. </p>\n\n<p>if http.request is using connection pooling, how to increase it?</p>\n\n<p>in both server, if I do \"ulimit -a\", the # of file open is 1024. </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** <strong>MORE AND MORE</strong> ** -------------------</p>\n\n<p>It seems that even I set maxSockets to higher number, it only works at some limit.  There seems to be a internal or OS dependent socket limitation.  However to bump it up? </p>\n\n<p>------------- ** AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING ** ---------------</p>\n\n<p>After reading lots of post, I find out:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>quoted from: <a href=\"https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/877</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1) If I set the headers with connection = 'keep-alive', the performance is good and can go up to maxSocket = 1024 (which is my linux setting).  </p>\n\n<pre><code>var options1 = {\n                  host: 'www.google.com',\n                  port: 80,\n                  path: '/',\n                  method: 'GET',\n    **headers: {\n            'Connection':'keep-alive'\n    }**\n                };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I set it to \"Connection\":\"close\", the response time would be 100 times slower. </p>\n\n<p>Funny things happened here:</p>\n\n<p>1) in EC2, when I first test with Connection:keep-alive, it will take about 20-30 ms.  Then if I change to Connection:Close  OR set Agent:false, the response time will slow down to 300 ms. WIHTOUT restarting the server, if I change to Connection:keep-alive again, the response time will slow down even further to 4000ms.   Either I have to restart server or wait for a while to get back my 20-30ms lighting speed response.</p>\n\n<p>2) If I run it with agent:false, at first, the response time will slow down to 300ms.  But then, it will get faster again and back to \"normal\".   </p>\n\n<p>My guess is connection pooling still in effect even you set agent:false.   However, if you keep connection:keep-alive, then it will be fast for sure.  just don't switch it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update on July 25, 2011</p>\n\n<p>I tried the latest node.js V0.4.9 with the http.js &amp; https.js fix from <a href=\"https://github.com/mikeal/node/tree/http2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mikeal/node/tree/http2</a>  </p>\n\n<p>the performance is much better and stable.</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":951,"score":5,"question_id":10808805,"title":"Accessing WebCam with NodeJS","body":"<p>Does anyone have any experience with trying to access a webcam through node?

NodeJS and HTML5 have grown and matured since then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What people usually do:</strong>\nWhen using multimedia streaming (i.e. video or audio) to a server, there is definitely nothing that beats Flash at the current point in time till the full arrival of <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">getUserMedia()</a> - which quite honestly might <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">take a while</a> till 99% of the browser users will get to use it at all.</p>\n\n<p>General practice to stream data to the server is by using a client Flash or Flex application which is then connecting to a RTMP protocol powered media server like <a href=\"http://www.red5.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RED5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/adobe-media-server-family.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FMS</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wowza.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wowza</a>. For example, the client app sending the microphone input over RTMP could look like (simplified version)</p>\n\n<pre><code>import flash.net.NetStream;\n\nprivate var myMic:Microphone;\nprivate var nc:NetConnection;\nprivate var ns:NetStream\n\nnc = new NetConnection();    \nns = new NetStream(nc);\nnc.connect(rtmp://localhost/serverApp);\nmyMic = Microphone.getMicrophone();\nns.attachAudio(myMic);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Together with a server application one is easibly able to stream data to the server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I would like to do:</strong>\nHave an app server running on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">nodeJS</a> (possibly implementing <a href=\"http://socket.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">socketIO</a> and <a href=\"http://binaryjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">binaryJS</a>) that catches the incoming RTMP stream. Something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>//require\nvar rtmp = require('node-rtmp'),\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n//rtmp server address\nvar rtmpServer = 'rtmp://localhost';\n\n//create a binary server listening that receives stream data\nvar RTMPServer = rtmp.RTMPServer();\nvar server = RTMPServer ({port: 1935});\n\nserver.on('connection', function(client){\n //check if user is allowed to do so\n rtmp.newStream(client.stream);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Possibly it might be better to use socketIO to differentiate between user interactions via eventEmitters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What might be the advantages:</strong> Generally speaking it seems like a bit overhead to make this kind of approach, but for me there might be advantages and I'd also like you to comment on this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>easy validation of user interaction by running e.g. <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">express</a> and socketIO</li>\n<li>hybrid implementation of a flash (via RTMP) and getUserMedia() (via binary transport mechanisms by adding binaryJS and the Mozilla AudioAPI)</li>\n<li>if getUserMedia() gets fully supported, flash implementations can be dropped easily</li>\n<li>more control over the rtmp followup and user interaction in general</li>\n<li>easier implementation into server frameworks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nI've talked to Mr. Malcontenti-Wilson who is responsible for the <a href=\"https://github.com/adammw/node-rtmp\" rel=\"nofollow\">only node-rtmp package</a> that was written but discontinued 8 months ago as it was poorly written and he hit a roadblock.

I see that the models module is exporting mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema); so I have to believe that is how the routes module has access to it, but I don't know why. What am I missing? I have a feeling its just not a complete understanding of scope in this situation. Also, I am not sure of the reasoning of having the routes function anonymous. </p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","mongodb","csv","export-to-csv"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48,"score":0,"question_id":13041648,"title":"Call mongoexport from javascript Node.js","body":"<p>I would like to export a Mongo Collection to an .csv.

Then check the users privacy settings, if he would like to receive notifications and then send and save it into the database.</p>\n\n<p>So to me this somehow seems not to be the most effective solution...</p>\n\n<p>At the moment <strong>I would use mongo-db native driver for node.js and have db operations done by serversided javascript.\nI still need to implement facebooks javascript sdk to get the friendslist, but I would have trouble with the users privacy settings.</strong> Doesn´t this destroy all the advantages of non-blocking I/O?</p>\n\n<p>How do you actually solve this. To me, it seems very complex.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","local-storage"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":431,"score":0,"question_id":10358100,"title":"How to access localStorage in node.js?","body":"<p>I tried searching the web for a node module that can access the client's localStorage but wasn't able to find anything.

I start to understand the basics :)</p>\n\n<p>I process data which is serialized in RDF (which is neither JSON nor XML). I manage to fetch the data (in real code via request) and parse it into a JS object using <code>rdfstore</code> module.</p>\n\n<p>So far I do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>s.createReadStream('myRDFdata.ttl').pipe(serialize()).pipe(process.stdout);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>serialize()</code>does the job of parsing an serializing the code at the same time right now. I use <code>through</code> module to interface to the stream.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have some more methods (not the real function declaration but I hope you get the point):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>getRecipe(parsedRDF)</code> -> takes the parsed RDF (as a JavaScript object) and tells me how to use it</li>\n<li><code>createMeal(parsedRDF, recipe)</code> ->  takes the parsed RDF and the recipe from above and creates a new RDF object out of it</li>\n<li>this new object needs to get serialized and sent to the browser</li>\n<li>(In the real world <code>getRecipe</code> will have to do a user interaction in the browser)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I like the idea of chaining this together via pipes for higher flexibility when I enhance the code later. But I don't want to serialize it to a RDF serialization every time but just send around the JS object. From what I've read in the documentation I could use the <code>stringify</code> module to get a string out of each step for piping it to the next step. But:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>does this actually make sense? In terms of do I add unnecessary overhead or is this negligible?</li>\n<li>I don't see how I could give the parsedRDF to both methods with the dependency that <code>getRecipe</code> would have to be called first and the output is input for <code>createMeal</code> as well. Are there modules which help me on that?</li>\n<li>It might be that I have to ask the user for the final recipe selection so I might need to send stuff to the browser there to get the final answer. Can I do something like this over sockets while the pipe is \"waiting\"?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope this shows what I'm trying to do, if not I will try to give more details/rephrase.</p>\n\n<p>Update: After sleeping over it I figured out some more things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It probably doesn't make sense to serialize a format like RDF into something non-standard if there are official serialization formats. So instead of using <code>stringify</code> I will simply pass an official RDF serialization between the steps</li>\n<li>This does imply that I parse/serialize the objects in each step and this surely does add overhead. Question is do I care? I could extend the RDF module I use to parse from stream and serialize into one</li>\n<li>I can solve the problem with the dependency between <code>getRecipe</code> and <code>createMeal</code> by simply adding some information from <code>getRecipe</code> to <code>parseRDF</code>, this can be done very easily with RDF without breaking the original data model. But I would still be interested to know if I could handle dependencies like this with pipes</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["json","node.js","mongodb"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":1,"question_id":13002601,"title":"MongoDB Collections format","body":"<p>I need to store restaurants with their corresponding menu items, so i did something like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ name: 'Foo',\n  menu: \n [ { item: 'foo',\n   description: '...',\n   price: 20 },\n { item: 'bar',\n   description: '...',\n   price: 30 } ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is i sometimes need to access this items, but it's not easy doing this, should i instead use something like this?</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ name: 'Foo',\nmenu: \n{ \"0\": { item: 'foo',\n   description: '...',\n   price: 20 },\n \"1\": { item: 'bar',\n   description: '...',\n   price: 30 } }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think it's cheaper to find an specific item.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","node.js","audio-streaming","html5-audio"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":445,"score":2,"question_id":10924955,"title":"Using Node.js to stream audio to html5 audio tag and bypass iOS limitation","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a project that use HTML5 audio and we have problems with the limitations on iOS devices (mostly multiple audio channels limitation).</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking that it may be possible to control the sounds server-side using node.js.

However, one of the directives in my Nginx configuration file ensures that requests for non-existent static files are not passed on to Yii. Instead, a simple 404 error is returned.

It shows the coordinates.  However, the OTHER browser doesn't do anything.  But if I move the mouse over to the other browser, it then displays the coordinates on its window.  It's like it only relays to the browser I am currently hovering over.  The server console shows movements on both browsers.  </p>\n\n<p>But since both browser windows are responding to the <code>relay</code> event (channel), shouldn't both browsers echo the coordinates?  So that browser 1's mouse movement is echoed to browser 2 and when I go over to browser two, its coordinates are echoed over to browser 1?</p>\n\n<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>** SOLUTION **</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Victor Stanciu for the quick answer.

My local version was outdated, and when pushing to Heroku, Heroku downloaded the latest version, with the API change that crashed my app.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong> : When using libraries not stable yet (that didn't reach 1.0), stick to a specific version.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you guys for trying to help me.</p>\n\n<p>=================</p>\n\n<p>Using Node 0.8.latest, express 3.latest. </p>\n\n<p>One of my route works perfectly locally, but gives me a 500 error when the app is deployed. The error message is very app-specific, but illogic. It's a TypeError, telling me that something (that should be defined) is undefined. To make it work, the only weird solution I found was to remove <code>node_modules</code> from .gitignore and tracking it under git. When pushed on heroku, no error appears and the url just works</p>\n\n<p>It starts to get strange when you know that I DID NOT change any code inside of the node_modules folder. I also compared locally and \"heroku\"ly installed dependencies by comparing a local <code>npm ls</code> to the list of modules produced when pushing to heroku, since it rebuilds the dependencies because they're <code>.gitignore</code>'d. I see minor but inexplicable differences on a few packages noted <code>invalid</code> with <code>npm ls</code>. None of this package is in my <code>package.json</code> file, they're dependencies for my package in <code>package.json</code>. Namely, <code>connect</code> is 2.4.4 locally and 2.5.0 on heroku, <code>send</code> is 0.0.4 locally and 0.1.0 on heroku, <code>emitter-compnonent</code> is 0.0.1 locally and 0.0.5 on heroku. The rest is striclty identical.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing to note is that the error stacktrace points a module which has identical versions on both environments and which doesn't depend on nor isn't a dependency for the modules that have different versions. So even the minor dependency differences shouldn't be the cause of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>But then, I can't see where does the problem come from, and I would like to avoid tracking my <code>node_modules</code> files.

I'm about 30% through with that. Right now I have a working prototype too, though not too far into the development of the client/server part. However, I know for a fact that all of my target audience WILL be connected to the internet (and not just LAN), and since I just did some reading on Node.js, <strong>I was thinking if I could make Windows Form clients (UI), with the clients interacting with a Node.js instance (backend).</strong></p>\n\n<p>From what I've read, I understand that one of the major advantages of using Node.js is that you can use the same language for both client and server. Perhaps creating a .NET web service would have been more sensible, but since I want to get my 'hands dirty' with Node.js, I would like to know if there is atleast a little sense in me trying to have a node.js server. Also, I want to try to get this done without spending money, since I'm just trying it out. I created an account with appfog, and it seems to be fairly easy to setup; I believe creating a reliable .NET web service will require me to <strong><em>BUY</em></strong> shared hosting at the least (not sure)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is such a communication (between .NET and node.js) readily possible?

(Also this is written in coffee-script running on node.js w/ harmony proxies enabled)</p>\n\n<p>The container is pretty straight forward. You create a new instance of a container object and store that variable globally, or locally.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Context    = require('ettore').Context\nAppContext = new Context()\nApp = AppContext.create 'App'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, I've also implemented a context object that manages sub-contexts (though i'll probably take that out)</p>\n\n<p>To store information within the container you use the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>App.set 'Namespace.Controller.Action', 'Value goes here'\nApp.set 'Namespace.Controller.Action.Index', 'Value goes here x2'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works perfectly and resolving a dependency is just as simple (also have the ability to use an async approach)</p>\n\n<pre><code>App.resolve 'Namespace.Controller.Action' # 'Value goes here'\nApp.get 'Namespace.Controller.Action' # 'Value goes here'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a good system but requires boilerplate code and it's required to go through the IoC container up-front and not \"behind the scenes\". So I started implementing an alias system that would make the previous code work like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NM = App.alias \"Namespace\"\nNM.Controller.Action # 'Value goes here'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works using harmony proxies provided by the V8 engine (with fallback to a library use). </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>The problem is simple but yet complex at the same time (unless I'm over thinking this...). Again with the previous set examples we have two components:</p>\n\n<p>Namespace.Controller.Action\n   Namespace.Controller.Action.Index</p>\n\n<p>My system works flawlessly with the first example, returning a resolved dependency if one has been found. Otherwise it will either emit an error or return false. The problem comes with knowing if you should return a dependency or another proxy object so they can continue down the line.</p>\n\n<p>To make this clear:</p>\n\n<p>The system goes object by object through the proxy and returns (typically) the same proxy object. This allows you to have long namespaces or a naming scheme of your choosing. If you call the following statement:</p>\n\n<p>Namespace.Controller.Action</p>\n\n<p>It will go through the system 2 times. One for the controller, and another for the action. The problem is that you honestly don't know if there's another object attached to the current one. (e.g Are they calling .Index after Action?)</p>\n\n<p>Right now i've implemented a sort of promise system that isn't so great. For the current \"loop\", it will check if a dependency exists for the fully qualified name. If so then it will add a mixing method called \"then\" apart from the ordinary proxy. </p>\n\n<p>So if you have the following namespaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Namespace.Controller.Action\nNamespace.Controller.Action.Index\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To access the contents of the \"Namespace.Controller.Action\" component you must use a promise as there's a \"conflict\" in naming. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Namespace.Controller.Action.then -&gt;\n   @get # 'Value goes here'\nNamespace.Controller.Action.Index # 'Value goes here x2'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to achieve or fix this problem? I'm getting closer with time but it all seems a little hacky at times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong>\nFor obvious reasons, I didn't post the full source code here as it's quite long.

I was able to determine this by putting lots of logs throughout my code, where I discovered that the \"begin-request\" log (described below) was not triggered when in the middle of an outbound request.</p>\n\n<p>I have been able to demonstrably show that when the Node+OAuth module is making a few outbound requests, the inbound requests to my API (via a browser window) will hang and not be received until one of those outbound OAuth requests has finished.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I've already done:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require('http').globalAgent.maxSockets = 999;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Per a suggestion in IRC, I've added</p>\n\n<pre><code>console.log(require('http').globalAgent.requests);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this always seems to be === {}, implying that there are no pending inbound requests AFAIK.</p>\n\n<p>Thus I am left to conclude that either node.js or express is choosing to, for some reason, block incoming requests due to the outbound requests, even though there should be plenty of sockets available...</p>\n\n<p>Anybody have any hints on how to solve this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have an API created in node.js using Express, Mongoose, etc. deployed on the Amazon Cloud which works wonderfully and fast 99% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Except, once in a while, a request seems to be somehow dropped or otherwise ignored. I'm talking about requests that usually complete in milliseconds randomly being unresponsive with no clear picture <strong>why</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The symptom is a simple \"Gateway Timeout\" when connecting to the API endpoint. An identical request, made from the same client with the same params, just moments before or moments after, will work just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, my first thought was \"duh, server overload!\" So I spent a lot of time optimizing my requests, monogoDB, etc. Finally I got to the point that the CPU/disk/RAM usage across the board (both in Node.js servers and in Mongo servers) was <strong>very</strong> low. I use Scout and RightScale to track my servers in real-time, and I log any request or query that takes more than 100ms. My node servers currently have 5GB of FREE RAM, 70% Free CPU (on the 1st core), etc. So I'm 99.99% certain it is not a performance issue.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I fell back on a desperate attempt: I attached a random number to all requests being made by my client(s). Then, in the node.js app, I do a console.log() when the request is first received and when it completes. Eg, here's the middleware I use in express:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var configureAPI = function() {\n    return function(req, res, next) {\n        if(req.body.ruid)\n            console.log(req.body.ruid);\n\n        // more middleware stuff...\n    };\n}\nserver.configure(function(){\n\n    server.use(express.bodyParser());\n    server.use(configureAPI());\n    server.use(onError);\n\n    // ...  more config stuff\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I found shocked me: apparently, <strong>the node.js app is not even receiving the requests in question</strong>. I have a Javascript webapp, and I print the \"ruid\" sent with the request to the console. Whenever the request succeeds, there is a corresponding \"ruid\" printed in the node.js console. Whenever it times out, there is not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: more debugging &amp; info.</p>\n\n<p>My app servers actually started (and continue) to also serve PHP (thus, they have Apache, etc. installed). I needed <a href=\"http://streamified.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://streamified.me</a> to serve my website (PHP) and <a href=\"http://api.streamified.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://api.streamified.me</a> to serve my API (node.js)... so I have a line in my httpd.conf file to cause requests to api.streamified.me (instead of streamified.me) to go to node.js via port 8888:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^api.streamified.me\nRewriteRule ^(.*) http://localhost:8888$1 [P]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, in the same httpd.conf file, I turned on RewriteLogLevel 5 and then created a simple PHP+CURL script on my localhost to hit my api.streamified.me with a random URL (which should cause node.js to trigger a simple \"not found\" response) until it resulted in a Gateway timeout. Here, you can see that it has happened -- and the rewrite log shows that the request was definitely received by the app server and forwarded to port 8888... but it was never received by node.js (or, at least, the first line of code in the first line of middleware never gets it...)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3OQxS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've been over and over my node.js code and am quite certain I do not have blocking code, and even if I did, I cannot imagine it blocking the thread long enough to miss a request without it raising a red flag somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?

The problem there is that I'm not overriding 'onConnect, onMessage' functions manually, instead Socket.IO does all that for me.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some way to integrate WebSockets into my Android Phonegap application?</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","codeigniter","node.js","notifications","socket.io"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":130,"score":0,"question_id":12867731,"title":"Creating a Node.js event listener for when there is a new mysql record inserted into table (For Notification Feed)","body":"<p>I am writing a PHP web application in Codeigniter that needs to have real time functionality.

The site will have users and they will have profiles and the profile pages will be provided by nginx (and some database).</p>\n\n<p>Now here is where it starts to get fuzzy for me. I want to use websockets, not ajax, for several things. One thing is that there will be a mail messaging on this site. When someone sends someone else a mail I want the mail to appear in that users mailbox without that user having to reload their webpage. I realize this is probably done through something called Comet? Basically the server is pushing info to the clients browser without them requesting it, right? So I want their mail to just appear (in real time) in the box.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the confusing part for me is that if you have nodejs sitting there and you direct some websocket traffic to it, how do you connect that with the rest of the web page? Would the node.js server and the nginx server have to talk to each other about how the final web page is appearing?</p>\n\n<p>Here is another example of a thing I want to do. Suppose that a user profile shows friends. When one friend comes online I want it to \"appear\" on their friend list, wherever that is. If nodejs is handling websockets and websockets is what is directing this bidirectional communication, will nodejs also have to talk to the database to get who the user is? Or will the database just be connected to nginx? Will both nginx and nodejs talk to the database which will hold information like users and their information?</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","profiling"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":1,"question_id":12864221,"title":"nodejs memory profiling","body":"<p>Need to profile node process. i've some memory leaks in production, after some days of running node process.</p>\n\n<p>i've tried node-inspector + v8, but it doesn't work, in new version of node-inspector there is no Profile tab. and in old version when i start profiling error is fired and debugging stopped.</p>\n\n<p>i've also tried nodetime.com, but it doesn't show what i need, also it takes too much memory, it's not for production.</p>\n\n<p>i've also tried dtrace (<a href=\"http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/04/25/profiling-node-js/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/04/25/profiling-node-js/</a>) but it doesn't give me necessary information.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>so what information i need for profiling memory:<br/>\nget live instances, instances count, size in memory, instance types</p>\n\n<p>do u know how to get that information?</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","binary","streamwriter"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":64,"score":0,"question_id":12868089,"title":"NodeJS write binary buffer into a file","body":"<p>I can't rewrite a file that I am getting from a binary buffer,  I have checked with the original file and all bytes are the same.</p>\n\n<p>This is the file create from NodeJS:</p>\n\n<pre><code># hd test.txt  | head\n00000000  47 49 46 38 39 61 32 00  32 00 f7 00 00 96 8c 73  |GIF89a2.2.�....s|\n00000010  66 5e 45 c6 bb 9f 7b 72  5a 47 47 47 8a 81 65 ca  |f^Eƻ.{rZGGG..e�|\n00000020  c1 a6 c9 c1 ac ee ea dd  c8 c5 bc 8c 87 7a d3 c9  |���������ż..z��|\n00000030  ab 43 3b 26 eb e5 d1 fa  fa fa e5 e4 e2 a6 9d 83  |�C;&amp;����������..|\n00000040  86 7e 67 c1 b4 8e e4 dc  c6 82 82 82 e1 dd d1 e3  |.~g��.���...����|\n00000050  dd ca e4 da bc f5 f1 e6  26 25 25 9c 91 73 f8 f3  |���ڼ���&amp;%%..s��|\n00000060  e4 c3 b9 9d d3 ca b4 4a  42 2a d1 c6 a2 6c 62 46  |�ù.�ʴJB*�ƢlbF|\n00000070  ea e6 db bb b3 9c db d3  bb 5c 54 3d f1 ee e6 dc  |��ۻ�.�ӻ\\T=����|\n00000080  da d3 e7 e4 dc ce c2 9f  f8 f6 f2 76 6c 53 fc fb  |�������.���vlS��|\n00000090  f9 e9 e1 ca 17 13 09 67  4d 00 f8 f4 e8 dc d3 b5  |����...gM.����ӵ|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This the original one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ hd runner_small.gif   | head\n00000000  47 49 46 38 39 61 32 00  32 00 f7 00 00 96 8c 73  |GIF89a2.2......s|\n00000010  66 5e 45 c6 bb 9f 7b 72  5a 47 47 47 8a 81 65 ca  |f^E...{rZGGG..e.|\n00000020  c1 a6 c9 c1 ac ee ea dd  c8 c5 bc 8c 87 7a d3 c9  |.............z..|\n00000030  ab 43 3b 26 eb e5 d1 fa  fa fa e5 e4 e2 a6 9d 83  |.C;&amp;............|\n00000040  86 7e 67 c1 b4 8e e4 dc  c6 82 82 82 e1 dd d1 e3  |.~g.............|\n00000050  dd ca e4 da bc f5 f1 e6  26 25 25 9c 91 73 f8 f3  |........&amp;%%..s..|\n00000060  e4 c3 b9 9d d3 ca b4 4a  42 2a d1 c6 a2 6c 62 46  |.......JB*...lbF|\n00000070  ea e6 db bb b3 9c db d3  bb 5c 54 3d f1 ee e6 dc  |.........\\T=....|\n00000080  da d3 e7 e4 dc ce c2 9f  f8 f6 f2 76 6c 53 fc fb  |...........vlS..|\n00000090  f9 e9 e1 ca 17 13 09 67  4d 00 f8 f4 e8 dc d3 b5  |.......gM.......|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can compare these two files and every bytes are the same, I am guessing that the encoding from NodeJS is not the right one.</p>\n\n<p>This is the piece of code</p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = \"71%73%70%56%57%97%50%0%50%0%247%0%0%150%140%115%102%94%69%198%187%159%123%114%90%71%71%71%138%129%101%202%193%166%201%193%172%238%234%221%200%197%188%140$\nvar bytes = foo.split(\"%\");\n\nvar b = new Buffer(bytes.length);\nfor (var i = 0;i &lt; bytes.length;i++) {\n        b[i] = bytes[i];\n}\n\nfs.writeFile(\"test.txt\", b,  \"binary\",function(err) {\n    if(err) {\n        console.log(err);\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"The file was saved!\");\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can try to run it on your NodeJS and see that the result is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>What can I do to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","uglifyjs"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12472702,"title":"How to use uglifyjs in node.js?","body":"<p>I want to use uglifyjs to compress the javascript files.

Well, now my \"posts\" are shown in a basic \"paginated\" visualization, I mean they're just picked up from mongo, sorted by date descending, a page at a time.

But then I have to show \"NEXT\" or \"PREV\" links, so I need to know what's the next or previous day containing posts, if any.

Then it repeats.</p>\n\n<p>All is well, the cycle goes on, errors are logged one after another:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>[...]\nError { [Error: asdasd 1068]\n  domain_thrown: true,\n  domain: { members: [ [Object] ], _events: { error: [Function] } } }\nError { [Error: asdasd 1069]\n  domain_thrown: true,\n  domain: { members: [ [Object] ], _events: { error: [Function] } } }\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I add the <code>domain.dispose()</code> where I suppose it should be:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>dm.on('error', function(er) {\n    console.error('Error', er);\n    dm.dispose();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way, the cycle is repeated only two times:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>Error { [Error: asdasd 1]\n  domain_thrown: true,\n  domain: { members: [ [Object] ], _events: { error: [Function] } } }\nError { [Error: asdasd 2]\n  domain_thrown: true,\n  domain: { members: [ [Object] ], _events: { error: [Function] } } }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No more output, the program just exits.</p>\n\n<p>So, either I don't understand the purpose and semantics of <code>domain.dispose()</code>, or it does what it should not do.

It provides a response and does not call next(). Therefore I am surprised to see that the 3rd handler ('*') is also called!\nAnother surprise is that the response ('res') passed to the 3rd handler is not the same as the one passed to the first handler. (If I were to call next() from the 1st handler then the 2nd handler would be called, and with the same response object.)</p>\n\n<p>Now for my real scenario: I want to process requests and verify authentication in a global manner. Some routes, however, should remain available for non-authenticated users. I based my solution on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7951810/check-each-node-js-request-for-authentication-credentials\">Zikes' answer</a>.\nI routed the \"free\" paths first. Then I included an route handler for all ('*'). It would call next() if the user is authenticated or next(err) otherwise. Following are all the \"restricted\" routes. And finally, my own error handler using app.use. It looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.use(app.router);\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n    console.log('An error occurred: ' + err);\n    res.send(401, 'Unauthorized');\n});\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello all');\n});\n\napp.all('*', function (req, res, next) {\n    if (req.user) {\n        next(); // authorized\n    } else {\n        next(new Error('401')); // unauthorized\n    }\n});\n\napp.get('/members', function (req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello member');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works rather well, blocking access to '/members'. However, it has bug: the authentication check and error handling happens even when accessing the non-restricted path ('/'). After the intended response is sent, the error handler tries to send a 401 error response. The latter does not get sent, but the code should not run.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a side effect of this mechanism is that unauthenticated users get an 401 error for non-existing pages. I may want to return a 404 in some of those cases. But now I'm just pushing it...</p>\n\n<p>I kinda have 2 questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this behavior a bug? Should the general handler be called without next being called?</li>\n<li>What would be a good solution for hooking many but not all routes, without having to mark them individually?</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["mongodb","node.js","pagination","mongoose"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":6,"up_vote_count":17,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":4079,"score":17,"question_id":5539955,"title":"How to paginate with Mongoose in node.js?","body":"<p>I am writing a webapp with Node.js and mongoose.

I'm currently using Python/Pylons for my web framework on the server, and doing polling to update items in the DOM of the page.

For instance if I want to update totals presented on the web application page, and those totals change due to actions in the system outside of node.js (other web applications), how is node.js notified of those changes? The thing that comes to mind is to have node.js poll the database for various changes and propagate the changes to the various Views. But to me that just sounds like I'm moving my polling from the web application to the node.js server?</p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any ideas, suggestions or pointers on this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!\nDoug</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","node.js","ftp","sftp","fileserver"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":50,"score":0,"question_id":12756430,"title":"Internal File Server Design Patterns?","body":"<p>My company processes data that comes from our clients.

I have failed finding the reason why this happens and why it doesn't happen every time.</p>\n\n<p>Code snipet of the login function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DB.getOne('User',{filters:{'primary':{email:req.body.email}}}, function(err,data){\n  if(data[0] &amp;&amp; data[0].active == 1){\n    var encodedPass = self.encodePass(req.body.pass,req.body.email);\n    if(encodedPass == data[0].pass){\n      req.session.pr.user = data[0];\n      req.session.pr.user.status = true; \n      res.writeHead(302, {\n        'Location': goTo \n      });\n      res.end();\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Looking directly into memcached I can see that this executes perfectly and the data is always saved into memcached under the original sessionID. For some reason the redirect must be changing the sessionID</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":12714979,"title":"Get the node.js install path from code","body":"<p>I'm trying to write a debugging framework for <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">node.js</a> and am having a hard time figuring out how to get the full path to a core module file like <code>fs.js</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard it's in the <code>/lib</code> folder of the node installation, but I'd need to get this from the code in a consistent way for a variety of install situations (including windows).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried taking a look at the <code>process</code> and <code>process.env</code> values for something like a node install path but can't see anything that immediately pops out at me.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","typescript"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":423,"score":1,"question_id":12742082,"title":"nodejs require inside TypeScript file","body":"<p>I am wondering how to load regular nodejs module from <code>node_modules</code> directory from inside <code>TypeScript</code> class.</p>\n\n<p>When I try to compile <code>.ts</code> file that contains:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var sampleModule = require('modulename');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>compiler tells me I cannot use require in this scope.

I want to use either <code>jsdom</code> or <code>node-jquery</code> to update the page that the user is on. I know that when I write the code, I could just have a regular <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that linked to a JavaScript file in the public directory, but I want to learn how to do it from the server if that is even possible. What I really want is to allow multiple users to connect to a page and have the page update for all users when one user does an action. For example, button 1 turns the background black. Button 2 turns it red, and button 3 turns it white. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that's possible by linking to a JavaScript file via a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. So looking at <code>jsdom</code>: </p>\n\n<pre><code>jsdom.env({html: ???, src: jquery, done: callback });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ok so here is <strong>problem number 1</strong>. I have no idea what to put for html in this bit of code to get my DOM objects, or what I can do. My files are written in jade, so I can't just load them from a file. Then I started thinking that maybe I can put this piece of code in the routing portion of my code and get the html from the <code>req</code> variable. So I started playing around in my routing code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>exports.index = function(){\n  res.render('index', {title: 'MyTitle'});\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And let me just say that this whole routing thing is already blowing my mind up. I have tried to <code>res.render</code> a second time, but that doesn't work. So that leads to <strong>problem number 2</strong>. Even if I could get the DOM objects and manipulate them, I don't know how I would push them back to the clients because doing a second <code>res.render</code> doesn't work. Not to mention that would defeat the purpose because I might as well redirect them to another page if I was making them re-render.</p>\n\n<p>I am planning on using <code>socket.io</code> to handle the users connections so maybe the key lies there. Maybe I could set a <code>socket.on('button_click', function(){ ... });</code> but I have no idea what to put inside that function to handle the DOM manipulation and update of the DOM, or how on the client side to have the button emit <code>'button_click'</code> because the client doesn't have access to the socket.io variable.</p>\n\n<p>So if someone could help explain these things to me using examples that would be so great. I really have tried to figure all of this out, I've spent a few days researching and reading the  API docs of node.js, express.js, socket.io, jsdom, and node-jquery. It just seems that all of the examples I find are very basic to just their own sphere and there are no examples that really tie them together.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","mongodb","nosql","node-mongodb-native"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":0,"question_id":12701235,"title":"Structuring database object with mongodb-native bindings for node.js","body":"<p>I'm working on creating an object that I can reuse throughout my server.

To use middleware, the function to use is <code>app.use()</code>. When the middleware is being executed, it will either call the next middleware by using <code>next()</code> or make it so no more middleware get called. That means that the order in which I place my middleware calls is important because some middleware depends on other middleware, and some middleware near the end might not even be called.</p>\n\n<p>Today I was working on my application, and had my server running in the background. I wanted to make some changes and refresh my page and see the changes immediately. Specifically, I was making changes to my layout. I couldn't get it to work so I searched SO for the answer and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612777/stylus-and-express-stylesheets-are-not-re-compiled-when-modified\">found this question.</a> It says to make sure that <code>express.static()</code> is beneath <code>require('stylus')</code>. But when I was looking at that OP's code, I saw that he had his <code>app.router</code> call at the very end of his middleware calls, and I tried to figure out why that was.</p>\n\n<p>When I made my express application (version 3.0.0rc4), I used the command <code>express app --sessions --css stylus</code> and in my app.js file the code came setup with my <code>app.router</code> above both the <code>express.static()</code> and <code>require('stylus')</code> calls. So it seems like, if it comes already setup that way, then it should stay that way.</p>\n\n<p>After re-arranging my code so I could see my Stylus changes, it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.configure(function(){\n  //app.set() calls\n  //app.use() calls\n  //...\n  app.use(app.router);\n  app.use(require('stylus').middleware(__dirname + '/public'));\n  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public', {maxAge: 31557600000}));\n});\n\napp.get('/', routes.index);\n\napp.get('/test', function(req, res){\n  res.send('Test');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I decided that the first step would be to find out why it is important to even have <code>app.router</code> in my code. So I commented it out, started my app and navigated to <code>/</code>. It displayed my index page just fine. Hmm, maybe it worked because I was exporting the routing from my routes file (routes.index). So next I navigated to <code>/test</code> and it displayed Test on the screen. Haha ok, I have no idea what <code>app.router</code> does. Whether it is included in my code or not, my routing is fine. So I am definitely missing something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So Here Is My Question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Could somebody please explain what <code>app.router</code> does, the importance of it, and where I should place it in my middleware calls? It would also be nice if I got a brief explanation about <code>express.static()</code>. As far as I can tell, <code>express.static()</code> is a cache of my information, and if the application can't find the requested page, it will check the cache to see if it exists.</p>\n"},{"tags":["image","node.js","mongodb","jade","expressjs"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12682543,"title":"ExpressJS: Retrieving images from MongoDB and displaying them in Jade","body":"<p>I am looking for good ways to retrieve images from MongoDB and display them.

I would like to use nodejs/socket.io to add that kind of functionality. \n<br/><br/>\nFirst problem I found was how to properly authorize user on nodejs side (user is already authenticated on php backend through PHP session). Using <strong>socket.handshake.header.cookie</strong> on nodejs side i can parse and get PHP session id, which I can authenticate through redis/memcache/database (depending on what have I used to save session information).<br/> Everything looks cool when user has only one tab/window of the site opened - when having more and using <strong>session_regenerate_id()</strong>, in nodejs the user authenticates with another sessionid key, so I cannot distinguish two tabs by anything other than the socket id they connected with. When user logouts he shouldn't be getting any messages on any tab (because he already logged out on every tab/window from that browser). So on logout message (sent from browser just before the logout PHP things) I should remove all the socket connections connected to the authorized user id. But what if user logges in on two devices (fe. pc browser and an ipad safaris). After logout on one device, he shouldn't be getting any messages on the device he logged out, not on every device. <strong>How can i distinguish connections from different devices/browsers in socket.io?</strong> Of course not using <strong>session_regenerate_id()</strong> would be efficent here, but what can I do if I really want to use this feature?\n<br/><br/>\nAnother problem I have is rather a security issue (or even question). Let's assume that authorized user in application can see page <strong>example.com/user1</strong> (which is a news feed for user1) and cannot see <strong>example.com/user2</strong> (fe. he doesn't have rights to see it). I'd like socket.io to send update messages to browser when user is on <strong>example.com/user1</strong>, and of course not to send when user is on <strong>example.com/user2</strong> site. On socket.io side I can read the referer address (so presumably, when user is on user2 site he does not get any socket.io connection). The question is: <strong>should I compare the referer address with the rights of authenticated user on node.js side? Or maybe the referer value is <em>safe</em> on the node.js side?</strong> Adding another db check on node.js side would slow it down (because almost every request there should be same database check on two sides - PHP and node.js).\n<br/><br/>\nOr maybe the whole concept of socket.io + PHP application working the way I presented is wrong? </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\n<br/><br/>\nI think I found a way to omit problems with the first question - basically I just add another cookie (besides PHPSESSID) fe. named NODESESSID, which I generate (fe. using uniqid()) when user is authorized. Now authorization on node.js side is comparing PHPSESSID and NODESESSID (both must match). Now, when user logges out he delivers the message <em>logout</em> to socket.io and socket.io disconnects all the sockets with NODESESSID. This is like connecting the benefits of regenerating session id and not regenerating session id (but is not vulnerable to session fixation, isn't it?). </p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","hosting"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":100,"score":1,"question_id":12685578,"title":"Free NodeJS hosting with own custom domain","body":"<p>I need to share my a little NodeJS application on a free nodejs hosting with my  bought via godaddy.com custom domain name .

I found one interesting node.js <a href=\"http://nodeguide.com/style.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">style guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A coding style guide, or coding conventions, should include (but is not limited to):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Code layout: indentation (2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs, ...), newlines, line breaks, etc.</li>\n<li>Whitespace, e.g., \"function (arg)\" vs. \"function(arg)\"</li>\n<li>Semicolon or no semicolon, var declaration, ...</li>\n<li>Naming, e.g., do_this() vs. doThis(), var_name vs. varName, ... </li>\n<li>node.js and JavaScript idioms, e.g., == vs. ===, callback's first arg is an error object, ...</li>\n<li>Comments and documentation</li>\n<li>Accompanying tools, like lint checker, unit test framework, ...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This topic obviously is highly subjective, but I think it's an important step of a community to establish a common and widely accepted coding style in the process of getting mature. Also, it's not all just about taste. In particular, rules like \"use === instead of ==\" have a direct influence on code quality.</p>\n"},{"tags":["node.js","dependency-injection"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":0,"question_id":12651489,"title":"Models with dependency injection in Nodejs","body":"<p>What is the best practice for injecting dependencies into models?

Namely I notice that query results are automatically being limited to 1000 records, while pretty much everything else works the same. In my code (below) I set a value <code>maxIvDataPoints</code> that limits the number of data points returned (and ultimately sent to the client browser), and that value was set elsewhere to 1500. I use a count query to determine the total number of potential results, and then a subsequent mod to limit the actual query results using the count and the value of <code>maxIvDataPoints</code> to determine the value of the mod. I'm running node 0.8.4 and mongo 2.0.4, writing server-side code in coffeescript.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to installing mongoose 3.1.x the code was working as I had wanted, returning just under 1500 data points each time.
