I have been doing this on a daily basis but almost every single day I get the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error - 'D:\\Code\\Website' is already locked via 'D:\\Code\\Website'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only very randomly does this error not happen and I am able to successfully merge trunk back into the branch. However, all day I've been trying to get the latest from the trunk without success. I have looked high and low for answers to this issue.. SO, Google, random forums on the internet... etc. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on why this might be happening.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I've already tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run \"Clean up\" on every single folder within the directory.</li>\n<li>Checked for \"lock\" file in .svn directory - doesn't exist.</li>\n<li>Opened wc.db file and checked WC_LOCK table - nothing in there.</li>\n<li>Disabled anti-virus.</li>\n<li>Disabled IIS.</li>\n<li>Checked out a fresh copy of the branch.</li>\n<li>Updated TortoiseSVN</li>\n<li>Completed uninstalled and re-installed TortoiseSVN with latest MSI from TortoiseSVN.net (1.7.10.23359, SVN 1.7.7).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am able to Update the branch and Commit it.. there has never been an issue with that. It's just Merging trunk back in that is causing me issues. No one else on the team seems to have this problem (with this branch, or any others). They can freely check the branch out.. merge trunk in and commit it without issues.</p>\n\n<p>I am using TortoiseSVN. Any help you guys/gals have would be fantastic!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also, a Test Merge works.. but an actual Merge doesn't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>It turns out TSVNCache.exe CONSTANTLY holds locks on the wc.db file. I have no idea why. Even if I kill the process; once I go through the TSVN Merge GUI it fires up the cache again and locks it. I have managed to successfully merge via the command line.. is there any way to fix the cache locking issue to avoid having to rely on the command line?</p>\n"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","svn","tortoisesvn","aptana"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":51,"score":1,"question_id":11820000,"title":"installing source control with Aptana","body":"<p>I am using Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.2.1.201207261642, I want to add my code any kind of source control for managability.

These files are generated to a separate directory, and only the necessary files are copied over (we don't copy all, because we don't want our partial files to be overwritten) to our working SVN copy of the project.</p>\n\n<p>Once those files are copied over, we compile, test locally, and then commit to SVN when stable.

He copied it over only to find that TortoiseSVN did not find any files changed. Odd, considering a new field was added to the database, and that usually affects quite a few files. He then did a \"Diff with previous version\" via the TortoiseSVN Explorer commands to confirm or deny the issue.</p>\n\n<p>However, when doing a diff between the previous version and the working copy version, he found that the file has, in fact, changed. For some reason TortoiseSVN isn't seeing that the file has changed.</p>\n\n<p>So, I wanted to give it my scout's best to determine if this was some isolated issue on his machine or something more. I killed my working copy, rechecked out, and tried doing the same steps. Same issue. TortoiseSVN was not picking up the changes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, just as an experiment, I opened up the file and copied over the contents manually. In this case, TortoiseSVN picked up the change perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with doing this manually, of course, is that it relies on the developer having to know every single file that was changed...and in addition takes a lot more time due to the sheer number of files updated.</p>\n\n<p>So, we're at our wits' end here.

However, now I feel like I've come to the point where I really want to start working on larger projects with multiple people. I've been talking over a few project ideas with another programmer who lives a few hours away from where I live, and even though we can meet up in person and share files about once a week, we're interested in the idea of using version control to share files and allow us to feel more secure with huge rewrites of our code.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is that neither of us have used any type of version control software, and we don't really know where to begin with sharing our source files over the internet.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard of git, SVN, mercurial, etc. And I've seen sites like github and google code. But I'm not really sure what the best solution is for our needs. From what I can tell, git is a very common version control software, but it seems not to be very user friendly at all. <em>Does git need to work with a site like github, do I need to host a private server, or is there some way to connect between just a few users in a peer-to-peer kind of way? Also, we use various programming languages (c++, java, c#, and lua); should that have any influence on which version control software that we use? Is there a more user friend (GUI-based or just simpler) version of git or other version control solutions that we should know about? [I should also add that we all use windows, so far..]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Basically, what is a good version control solution for a small team (2-4) of programmers who have little-to-no experience with version control to use?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit (elaboration):</p>\n\n<p>Which GUI frontends make the experience of using git or other VCS easier to learn and manage for inexperienced users?</p>\n\n<p>When using a system like git is it possible to sync our repository via LAN or even via removable media (like an external HDD)?

In this post, the svnsync is used to synchronize the subgit-repo with the svn-repo, but the synchronization is one-way only, from svn-repo to subgit-repo :(</p>\n\n<p>So, I've discovered svnadmin dump and load and I can use them to keep svn-repo synchronized with the subgit-repo. For example:</p>\n\n<p>svnadmin dump --incremental subgit-repo | svnadmin load svn-repo</p>\n\n<p>My question is: Is it a good idea to use svnadmin dump and load to keep my repositories synchronized?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":59,"score":2,"question_id":12567516,"title":"SVN one project : multiple programmers, Locking or Brancing which one is better?","body":"<p>We multiple programmers have to work at one project simultaneously.

If it does not copy, do I really need to change the permissions with every checkout?</li>\n<li>I have a .htaccess file that I don't want to check into the repository. If I do an update on a working copy that contains a .htaccess (but the repository doesn't have that file), will the file be deleted or will the update leave it alone?</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["xcode","svn"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":0,"question_id":12921076,"title":"Can't commit/update file in Xcode editor (SVN)","body":"<p>I'm having problems with Xcode's built in SVN manager.</p>\n\n<p>I checked out an SVN repository and I want to commit the changes while I'm working in Xcode's editor.

I'm planning to start collaborating with a friend on one of the projects, and will be shifting the repository to my own website.  I've read a lot of \"git beats SVN!\" posts over the last couple years, and figured I ought to at least see what the fuss was about.  Some research turned up the \"git svn\" command, and that TortoiseGit claims to have some level of git-svn support.  I like the idea of keeping the SVN repository, and doing some local commits or branches with git before committing them to the repository.  The \"shelve\" command also sounds useful.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while there's a number of CLI git-svn tutorials, there's nothing for TortoiseGit (which admittedly seems to be still in early development).  As a result, I'm having problems trying to figure out what workflow I need to get these pieces to cooperate.  </p>\n\n<p>I have an SVN repository in D:\\Projects\\repositories\\MyProject.  I created D:\\Projects\\temp\\gittest, and tried to do a TortoiseGit \"Git Clone\" of the repository.  From there, I've had issues trying to indicate the location of the trunk/branches/tags folders (which are just the standard layout in my repository).  I was only able to get useful results when I left those unchecked.  When I did seem to get the git repository started correctly, I was able to make some changes and do a couple git commits, but then had problems doing an SVN DCommit.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm hoping someone out there can provide a reasonably detailed set of instructions on how to correctly use TortoiseGit with an existing SVN repository (with the repository on either the local filesystem or on a remote server).  No \"don't use SVN!\" responses, please - I'm interested in learning how to get these two pieces to work together.  If you feel TortoiseGit's SVN support isn't mature enough to make this work, that would also be useful information.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn","svnignore"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":2,"question_id":12898256,"title":"How to know if a specific file is being ignored or not","body":"<p>I would like to know if there is any way to know if an specific file is being ignored or not inside a subversioned project.

The problem I'm experiencing is keeping my shared-code synced between the projects - my current solution is very \"manual\" and time consuming (and error prone when I forget to update everything). I started looking into SVN externals as a solution, but there's one problem. The Unity game engine uses *.meta files to maintain data for how the files in question are used within each game. </p>\n\n<p>As a quick example - here is a sample folder structure:</p>\n\n<p>Project 1:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ROOT</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.cs</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.meta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Project 2:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ROOT</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.cs</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.meta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The obvious/immediate solution is to just make my \"SharedCode\" folder an SVN external. The issue that arises is that the SharedScript.cs file should be identical on both projects, but the SharedScript.meta file is project specific and auto-generated by the game engine (so I can't say, store all my meta files in a single folder somewhere external to the \"SharedCode\" folder). </p>\n\n<p>There are hundreds of these files, so I'd love a solution that doesn't involve treating each \"shared\" file as an SVN external unto itself. </p>\n\n<p>My current ugly solution is to keep the whole project tree in SVN - and I have a sub-folder that is a GIT repo which ignores the .meta files. It's pretty ugly though, and I frequently commit/update the main project and forget to commit/push/pull the git \"library\" project. </p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3104,"score":5,"question_id":361801,"title":"How to change structure of subversion repository?","body":"<p>I'm a newbie with Subversion, so I don't now if this is a dumb question:</p>\n\n<p>I've inherited a subversion repository with a flat structure with no /trunk /tags /branches top level).</p>\n\n<p>I'd like re-structure it so that it follows the </p>\n\n<pre><code>/trunk\n/tags\n/branches\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>layout.</p>\n\n<p>Is this possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","svn","version-control","branching-and-merging"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":82,"score":0,"question_id":12889215,"title":"File version control vs revision control","body":"<p>I used SVN + GIT but still find it's not quite satisfied as they do not use file-level version control.

The problem is each branch not only contains those files but also the project settings files, the configuration, the test scripts ... that i needed to put in version control while developing the library as well.

One of the small goals is to update multiple locations when we change our passwords. One of these locations that needs to be updated is subversion. Most of the developers use TortoiseSvn but not all do (so I'd prefer a program neutral solution but it's not a requirement). </p>\n\n<p>From my research around this topic, my first impression was that Tortoise or another application would have a change password function that I could use. This isn't so from what I can find. So my next thought was to change the encrypted password that is stored in %APPDATA%\\Subversion\\auth\\svn.simple. This way, we could bypass any program and just fix the local machine credentials and be on our merry way.</p>\n\n<p>For a Windows machine, subversion uses the wincrypt password-store for encryption. Working with that code was fairly straight forward. I found this <a href=\"http://www.obviex.com/Samples/Dpapi.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">DPAPI (from Obviex)</a> code that would work to handle the encryption for me. It just takes care of the details for me (small note: I had some small issues with <code>System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData</code> so I decided to stick with this other way).</p>\n\n<p>With this code, I was able to decrypt the password from the svn.simple folder and find that it worked (Previously saved authentication was decrypted and turned up the right password). However, when I would encrypt the password and store it in the proper place, I will always get a login screen from TortoiseSvn. It doesn't like my encrypted password. </p>\n\n<p>So what's my question... has anyone accomplished something similar to what I am trying to do? Should I just forget trying to update the subversion password? Should I force a checkout of a repository and provide the credentials (I can do this using <a href=\"http://sharpsvn.open.collab.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SharpSvn</a>) and then delete the repository once it finishes?</p>\n\n<p>Guess I am just hoping to find that someone has solved this problem already and can point me in the right direction.

They are often targeted at guys who just want to use git and hack locally, without using the full power of git, like pull, fetch, merge and the like between multiple developers who would all have cloned the svn repository with git-svn, then still expect to be able to push their changes anytime to the (official) svn repository, and get back to working in git and sharing their stuff etc.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever these articles admit you can't do everything you'd do in pure git, the consequences and possible screw ups are never clearly explained (or maybe it's juste me ?). Even the git-svn man page mentions caveats, but not really in an extensive manner.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what I've read, I feel there could be problems when git-svn is used in that specific way, which I'll describe below. Can someone tell me if I'm right about this ?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the \"wanted\" way of doing things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We have a project in a svn repository</li>\n<li>Developer A git-svn-clone's the svn repo. He begins to hack things locally</li>\n<li>Developer B git-svn-clone's the same svn repo. He begins to hack things on his own.</li>\n<li>After doing that for some time, possibly adding devs C/D/..., and having other developers who do \"standard\" svn commits to the original repo, the git users would want to share their code and do all kinds of git magic.</li>\n<li>Any one of those git users would like to be able to push the now merged changes to svn (dcommit?)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My question is: am I dreaming? I read some time ago, in a git book I think, that git-svn-clone could create git repositories that are of course a \"mirror\" of the svn repo, but that git repos created that way by different developers would have different \"ids\" and commits would have different hashes. So my understanding was that those git repos wouldn't share any common git ancestor, and thus wouldn't be able to use all the git commands you need to share, merge, and so on. Is it true, are we gonna face problems with this workflow ?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I read this could be done, using at least an \"official\" bare git repository, that would be the only one to be git-svn-cloned, and all git users would have to start form this one. Then you need someone who is in charge of this central git repo, and gathers the changes between the git devs, before dcommiting everything to the svn repo. This would be the only way for git users to be \"unaware\" that the original git repo comes from svn, and would let them use all git commands as they like. The only person who would need to be fluent in both git and svn (and know about git-svn caveats) would be the \"merge manager\" (or whatever he's called).</p>\n\n<p>Am I completely misunderstanding git-svn caveats ?

It should also be noted that we've been running this server for a while no without these problems and apart from splitting the project into two repositories, no changes have been made to the server (ie, config files are the same).</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that these errors only appear when we try to check in multiple files at once.

Also, it only appears in Subclipse as far as we know right now, Versions.app (OS X) seems to work fine so that is our current workaround.</p>\n\n<p>So, the questions is how do I analyze the error to find the cause and subsequently fix it?

Also, when I \"split\" the project into two repositories, I imported the original repository with a new name. I did not do a dump and then import that dump. Could that be the source of our issues, and if so, how would I solve that?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After some jerking around it seems as though it is indeed related to when checking in files in different repositories. If I try to do a single commit in both Repo A and Repo B (referenced by svn:externals) at the same time, I get the error. Versions.app handles this correctly, but I guess it might just be doing two commits, not a single one. Subclipse fails miserably. For now, we simply do multiple commits, one for Repo A and one for Repo B, that works just fine.

The Ditz readme mentions that there are 3 different ways of maintaining the file and one is to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keep the issue database in the repository but in a separate branch. Issue changes can be managed by your VCS, but is not tied directly to code commits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This led me to think that I could use the same thing to keep some files used for packaging in a repository shared with a few other developers that I now keep separate. So I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why should I use/not use this approach?</li>\n<li>How is this setup? Not specifically for Ditz, but for any files. </li>\n<li>How does it work day-to-day?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have almost no experience with branching and everywhere I look it is used to keep an edited copy of trunk that will be merged later.\nI use mainly subversion, but an answer for a dvcs is also fine as long as it translates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I looked a bit more into this and this is what I've found. The following apply to subversion.</p>\n\n<p>From the svnbook,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Subversion has no internal concept of a branch—only copies</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which maybe means that svn branches are not exactly what is suggested in the ditz readme. It seems to me that what ditz is suggesting can be achieved using <code>svn:externals</code>. Assuming the following structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/trunk/project1/\n/trunk/project2/\n/branches/notes/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>one could set the <code>svn:externals</code> property in project1 and project2 to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>notes http://reposerver/branches/notes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way updating the working copies of the projects would also get the \"external\" notes, but committing would need to take place separately for the notes and the other files in the projectX trees. Other than that, everything would be the same as usual. The disadvantages are more or less the disadvantages of svn:externals, i.e. only applicable to directories and that they are defined as absolute URLs.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if anyone has any further insights I would be interested.</p>\n"},{"tags":["eclipse","svn","subversive"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":12552819,"title":"How to share only source with SVN in Eclipse?","body":"<p>I want to share the source code of my project through SVN, but I can only share the entire project.

What if I dump out just the revisions of the project I'm interested in? I can run <code>svnadmin dump</code> for each revision. I think this might actually be faster. However, how will this affect the load into a new repository?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a problem of simply dumping only the revisions I want?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","svn","shell","code-review"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12535191,"title":"Bash script to copy|move untracked SVN|GIT files from repository","body":"<p>I am learning shell scripting at the moment and, as an exercise, I wrote a little script to copy/move all untracked files and folders from my GIT/SVN repository to the output directory.</p>\n\n<p>Now I need a code-review.
