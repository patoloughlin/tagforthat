Versions.app handles this correctly, but I guess it might just be doing two commits, not a single one. Subclipse fails miserably. For now, we simply do multiple commits, one for Repo A and one for Repo B, that works just fine.

What is this .edited file, and is there some way that I can configure SVN or Subclipse to stop generating it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn","repository","migrate"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":530,"score":2,"question_id":7666671,"title":"Migrating Subversion Repositories accross servers","body":"<p>We're in the process of moving servers and one of the last items is moving over the svn repositories. </p>\n\n<p>There are about 10 gigs of various svn repositories.

These files are generated to a separate directory, and only the necessary files are copied over (we don't copy all, because we don't want our partial files to be overwritten) to our working SVN copy of the project.</p>\n\n<p>Once those files are copied over, we compile, test locally, and then commit to SVN when stable. This has worked fine on this project for more than a year.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, one of our developers generated the code as the norm. He copied it over only to find that TortoiseSVN did not find any files changed. Odd, considering a new field was added to the database, and that usually affects quite a few files. He then did a \"Diff with previous version\" via the TortoiseSVN Explorer commands to confirm or deny the issue.</p>\n\n<p>However, when doing a diff between the previous version and the working copy version, he found that the file has, in fact, changed. For some reason TortoiseSVN isn't seeing that the file has changed.</p>\n\n<p>So, I wanted to give it my scout's best to determine if this was some isolated issue on his machine or something more. I killed my working copy, rechecked out, and tried doing the same steps. Same issue. TortoiseSVN was not picking up the changes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, just as an experiment, I opened up the file and copied over the contents manually. In this case, TortoiseSVN picked up the change perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with doing this manually, of course, is that it relies on the developer having to know every single file that was changed...and in addition takes a lot more time due to the sheer number of files updated.</p>\n\n<p>So, we're at our wits' end here. Is this a bug? Some setting that might have been tricked?

Once the checkout reaches a certain directory (bad revision adds 2,000 files to this directory (which contains 17,000 files already)) files are added to the working copy significantly slower (like 5 files a second) for the rest of the checkout.

I'm planning to start collaborating with a friend on one of the projects, and will be shifting the repository to my own website.  I've read a lot of \"git beats SVN!\" posts over the last couple years, and figured I ought to at least see what the fuss was about.  Some research turned up the \"git svn\" command, and that TortoiseGit claims to have some level of git-svn support.  I like the idea of keeping the SVN repository, and doing some local commits or branches with git before committing them to the repository.  The \"shelve\" command also sounds useful.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while there's a number of CLI git-svn tutorials, there's nothing for TortoiseGit (which admittedly seems to be still in early development).

I am an indie game developer working on 6-7 client projects at any given time with the Unity game engine. The problem I'm experiencing is keeping my shared-code synced between the projects - my current solution is very \"manual\" and time consuming (and error prone when I forget to update everything). I started looking into SVN externals as a solution, but there's one problem. The Unity game engine uses *.meta files to maintain data for how the files in question are used within each game. </p>\n\n<p>As a quick example - here is a sample folder structure:</p>\n\n<p>Project 1:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ROOT</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.cs</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.meta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Project 2:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ROOT</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.cs</li>\n<li>ROOT/Assets/SharedCode/SharedScript.meta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The obvious/immediate solution is to just make my \"SharedCode\" folder an SVN external. The issue that arises is that the SharedScript.cs file should be identical on both projects, but the SharedScript.meta file is project specific and auto-generated by the game engine (so I can't say, store all my meta files in a single folder somewhere external to the \"SharedCode\" folder). </p>\n\n<p>There are hundreds of these files, so I'd love a solution that doesn't involve treating each \"shared\" file as an SVN external unto itself. </p>\n\n<p>My current ugly solution is to keep the whole project tree in SVN - and I have a sub-folder that is a GIT repo which ignores the .meta files. It's pretty ugly though, and I frequently commit/update the main project and forget to commit/push/pull the git \"library\" project. </p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3107,"score":5,"question_id":361801,"title":"How to change structure of subversion repository?","body":"<p>I'm a newbie with Subversion, so I don't now if this is a dumb question:</p>\n\n<p>I've inherited a subversion repository with a flat structure with no /trunk /tags /branches top level).</p>\n\n<p>I'd like re-structure it so that it follows the </p>\n\n<pre><code>/trunk\n/tags\n/branches\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>layout.</p>\n\n<p>Is this possible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","svn","version-control","branching-and-merging"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":83,"score":0,"question_id":12889215,"title":"File version control vs revision control","body":"<p>I used SVN + GIT but still find it's not quite satisfied as they do not use file-level version control.

One of the small goals is to update multiple locations when we change our passwords. One of these locations that needs to be updated is subversion. Most of the developers use TortoiseSvn but not all do (so I'd prefer a program neutral solution but it's not a requirement). </p>\n\n<p>From my research around this topic, my first impression was that Tortoise or another application would have a change password function that I could use. This isn't so from what I can find. So my next thought was to change the encrypted password that is stored in %APPDATA%\\Subversion\\auth\\svn.simple. This way, we could bypass any program and just fix the local machine credentials and be on our merry way.</p>\n\n<p>For a Windows machine, subversion uses the wincrypt password-store for encryption. Working with that code was fairly straight forward. I found this <a href=\"http://www.obviex.com/Samples/Dpapi.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">DPAPI (from Obviex)</a> code that would work to handle the encryption for me. It just takes care of the details for me (small note: I had some small issues with <code>System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData</code> so I decided to stick with this other way).</p>\n\n<p>With this code, I was able to decrypt the password from the svn.simple folder and find that it worked (Previously saved authentication was decrypted and turned up the right password). However, when I would encrypt the password and store it in the proper place, I will always get a login screen from TortoiseSvn. It doesn't like my encrypted password. </p>\n\n<p>So what's my question... has anyone accomplished something similar to what I am trying to do? Should I just forget trying to update the subversion password? Should I force a checkout of a repository and provide the credentials (I can do this using <a href=\"http://sharpsvn.open.collab.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SharpSvn</a>) and then delete the repository once it finishes?</p>\n\n<p>Guess I am just hoping to find that someone has solved this problem already and can point me in the right direction.

They are often targeted at guys who just want to use git and hack locally, without using the full power of git, like pull, fetch, merge and the like between multiple developers who would all have cloned the svn repository with git-svn, then still expect to be able to push their changes anytime to the (official) svn repository, and get back to working in git and sharing their stuff etc.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever these articles admit you can't do everything you'd do in pure git, the consequences and possible screw ups are never clearly explained (or maybe it's juste me ?). Even the git-svn man page mentions caveats, but not really in an extensive manner.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what I've read, I feel there could be problems when git-svn is used in that specific way, which I'll describe below. Can someone tell me if I'm right about this ?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the \"wanted\" way of doing things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We have a project in a svn repository</li>\n<li>Developer A git-svn-clone's the svn repo. He begins to hack things locally</li>\n<li>Developer B git-svn-clone's the same svn repo. He begins to hack things on his own.</li>\n<li>After doing that for some time, possibly adding devs C/D/..., and having other developers who do \"standard\" svn commits to the original repo, the git users would want to share their code and do all kinds of git magic.</li>\n<li>Any one of those git users would like to be able to push the now merged changes to svn (dcommit?)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My question is: am I dreaming? I read some time ago, in a git book I think, that git-svn-clone could create git repositories that are of course a \"mirror\" of the svn repo, but that git repos created that way by different developers would have different \"ids\" and commits would have different hashes. So my understanding was that those git repos wouldn't share any common git ancestor, and thus wouldn't be able to use all the git commands you need to share, merge, and so on. Is it true, are we gonna face problems with this workflow ?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I read this could be done, using at least an \"official\" bare git repository, that would be the only one to be git-svn-cloned, and all git users would have to start form this one. Then you need someone who is in charge of this central git repo, and gathers the changes between the git devs, before dcommiting everything to the svn repo. This would be the only way for git users to be \"unaware\" that the original git repo comes from svn, and would let them use all git commands as they like. The only person who would need to be fluent in both git and svn (and know about git-svn caveats) would be the \"merge manager\" (or whatever he's called).</p>\n\n<p>Am I completely misunderstanding git-svn caveats ?

I considered four approaches but they all have downsides; is there another approach that I haven't considered, or barring that, can anyone provide insight into the best approach long-term?</p>\n\n<p>Here are the approaches I considered:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the appropriate subfolder of the SVN repo in each system folder. Probably the simplest technically, but I don't like that a lot of separate commits become necessary to constitute what might be a single \"logical\" commit. Same with updates.</li>\n<li>Keep a SVN checkout in a single spot and use a program to sync the SVN hierarchy and the system folders. Makes SVN usage a little simpler, but it's more moving parts. It's also pretty easy to overwrite uncommitted work if someone syncs in the wrong direction.</li>\n<li>Single SVN checkout, use junctions/symlinks to the system folders. Based on my attempts and some web searches, this appears to be technically impossible at this time. It also feels a little fragile.</li>\n<li>I might be able to go the opposite way and change the hard-coded program folders so that they are symlinks/junctions to subfolders of my SVN checkout. That still seems a little fragile: software updates might replace the symlink, or one or more of the programs might not like symlinks either. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please note that some of the people that will be working with this repository are not developers, so I'd like to keep things as simple as possible for them.

The Ditz readme mentions that there are 3 different ways of maintaining the file and one is to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keep the issue database in the repository but in a separate branch. Issue changes can be managed by your VCS, but is not tied directly to code commits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This led me to think that I could use the same thing to keep some files used for packaging in a repository shared with a few other developers that I now keep separate. So I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why should I use/not use this approach?</li>\n<li>How is this setup? Not specifically for Ditz, but for any files. </li>\n<li>How does it work day-to-day?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have almost no experience with branching and everywhere I look it is used to keep an edited copy of trunk that will be merged later.\nI use mainly subversion, but an answer for a dvcs is also fine as long as it translates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I looked a bit more into this and this is what I've found. The following apply to subversion.</p>\n\n<p>From the svnbook,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Subversion has no internal concept of a branch—only copies</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which maybe means that svn branches are not exactly what is suggested in the ditz readme. It seems to me that what ditz is suggesting can be achieved using <code>svn:externals</code>. Assuming the following structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/trunk/project1/\n/trunk/project2/\n/branches/notes/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>one could set the <code>svn:externals</code> property in project1 and project2 to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>notes http://reposerver/branches/notes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way updating the working copies of the projects would also get the \"external\" notes, but committing would need to take place separately for the notes and the other files in the projectX trees. Other than that, everything would be the same as usual. The disadvantages are more or less the disadvantages of svn:externals, i.e. only applicable to directories and that they are defined as absolute URLs.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if anyone has any further insights I would be interested.</p>\n"},{"tags":["eclipse","svn","subversive"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":12552819,"title":"How to share only source with SVN in Eclipse?","body":"<p>I want to share the source code of my project through SVN, but I can only share the entire project.

What if I dump out just the revisions of the project I'm interested in? I can run <code>svnadmin dump</code> for each revision. I think this might actually be faster. However, how will this affect the load into a new repository?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a problem of simply dumping only the revisions I want?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","svn","shell","code-review"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":34,"score":0,"question_id":12535191,"title":"Bash script to copy|move untracked SVN|GIT files from repository","body":"<p>I am learning shell scripting at the moment and, as an exercise, I wrote a little script to copy/move all untracked files and folders from my GIT/SVN repository to the output directory.</p>\n\n<p>Now I need a code-review.

I've been reading the <a href=\"http://svnbook.red-bean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Subversion book</a> and there seems to one major feature that StarTeam has that Subversion doesn't - the concept of labels.  I know Subversion has labels, but they mean something different in StarTeam.  In StarTeam, I can label a set of files as \"ready to build\" and then only check those out and include in a particular release.  I can then create a frozen label indicating what files were included in that release (similar to a Subversion tag, except it's on those specific revisions, not everything in the directory).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to get such functionality in Subversion?  I know you can specify which revision to tag, but what happens in the situation where you have code and are about to do a release, and find a bug, or someone decides a particular change shouldn't be included.  I know you can create the tag based on the repository and your local working copy, but this involves checking out specific revisions of the files that shouldn't be included and creating the tag.  With a ready to build \"label\", you wouldn't put that label on the head version of the files you didn't want.  There doesn't appear any automatic way to designate certain revisions for a build in Subversion.  This isn't the case where a new feature should be developed in a branch, but more if a revision is in the trunk (or wherever you will make the tag from), but shouldn't be included.  It may not need to be reverted - the change could be appropriate, but in a future release, not this current one.  If you don't have a specific revision with the exact file versions you need, it seems like you'll have to manually mix and match from the repository and your working copy.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar situation, what if you have files in Subversion that aren't part of the release and don't need to be tagged.

Is this what <strong>svndumpfilter exclude</strong> is for?</p>\n\n<p>In short, is there a way to only include specific revisions of certain files in a tag, or does it have to be either a specific revision in the repository, or a manual mix of files in the repository and your working copy?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","svn","maven","build","jenkins"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":12405645,"title":"How can I checkin a file, generated by maven build, automatically in SVN?","body":"<p>I build my project in Jenkins and during the build process I generate some DB files. </p>\n\n<p>They should be checked in SVN at the end.</p>\n\n<p>How can I do that?</p>\n"},{"tags":["linux","svn","tor"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":2,"question_id":12015700,"title":"Configuring SVN to pass through TOR proxy","body":"<p>I can find \"http-proxy-*\" variables in .subversion/server to configure SVN to pass through HTTP proxy server.

The main usage is to keep versions for the source code files in the project: make changes on trunk, create branches to play or make any kind of work with the source code files and define the final versions using the tag folder; this is a good software tool and people in my work (including myself) is very attached with it. But lately, I've seen in my workplace that there are similar problems handling documents (word, excel, some power point and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>I know this could be a silly question but it would be good to use SVN to handle versions for these files too? Maybe (or maybe not) SVN will behave the same handling these kind of files as with source code files, but I just have this doubt in my mind. I've used it to save documents before on a college project and it didn't give problems, but after doing some research on the internet I haven't found any post saying that you could use SVN for a different purpose than keeping versions of source code.

Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program\n# (script, executable, binary, etc.) named 'pre-commit' (for which\n# this file is a template), with the following ordered arguments:\n#\n#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)\n#   [2] TXN-NAME     (the name of the txn about to be committed)\n#\n#   [STDIN] LOCK-TOKENS ** the lock tokens are passed via STDIN.\n#\n#   If STDIN contains the line \"LOCK-TOKENS:\\n\" (the \"\\n\" denotes a\n#   single newline), the lines following it are the lock tokens for\n#   this commit.  The end of the list is marked by a line containing\n#   only a newline character.\n#\n#   Each lock token line consists of a URI-escaped path, followed\n#   by the separator character '|', followed by the lock token string,\n#   followed by a newline.\n#\n# The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so\n# the program should set one explicitly if it cares.\n#\n# If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed; but\n# if it exits with failure (non-zero), the txn is aborted, no commit\n# takes place, and STDERR is returned to the client.   The hook\n# program can use the 'svnlook' utility to help it examine the txn.\n#\n# On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have 'pre-commit'\n# invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the\n# work itself too.\n#\n#   ***  NOTE: THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN, EXCEPT  ***\n#   ***  FOR REVISION PROPERTIES (like svn:log or svn:author).   ***\n#\n#   This is why we recommend using the read-only 'svnlook' utility.\n#   In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that pre-commit\n#   hooks should not modify the versioned data in txns, or else come\n#   up with a mechanism to make it safe to do so (by informing the\n#   committing client of the changes).  However, right now neither\n#   mechanism is implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.\n#\n# Note that 'pre-commit' must be executable by the user(s) who will\n# invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must\n# have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.\n#\n# On a Windows system, you should name the hook program\n# 'pre-commit.bat' or 'pre-commit.exe',\n# but the basic idea is the same.\n#\n# The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of\n# its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the\n# PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so\n# that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.\n# If you're having unexpected problems with a hook program, the\n# culprit may be unusual (or missing) environment variables.\n# \n# Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter.\n# For more examples and pre-written hooks, see those in\n# the Subversion repository at\n# http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/hook-scripts/ and\n# http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/contrib/hook-scripts/\n\n\nREPOS=\"$1\"\nTXN=\"$2\"\n\n# Make sure that the log message contains some text.\nSVNLOOK=/usr/local/bin/svnlook\n$SVNLOOK log -t \"$TXN\" \"$REPOS\" | \\\n   grep \"[a-zA-Z0-9]\" &gt; /dev/null || exit 1\n\n# Check that the author of this commit has the rights to perform\n# the commit on the files and directories being modified.\ncommit-access-control.pl \"$REPOS\" \"$TXN\" commit-access-control.cfg || exit 1\n\nC:\\wamp\\bin\\php\\php5.4.3\\scripts\\phpcs-svn-pre-commit \"$REPOS\" -t \"$TXN\" &gt;&amp;2 || exit 1\n\n# All checks passed, so allow the commit.\nexit 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am pretty new to both SVN and codesniffer so i am pretty much just following guides and running tests as i go along.

I think finally today we found the cause of svn being slow. We're using Zend_Auth and call Zend_Auth::hasIdentity() on every page to check if users are logged in. This call creates a session, which in turn creates a session file on the server. If the browser (or googlebot) is browsing with cookies turned off we create one session file for every single request. Hence our session directory had millions of files. We deleted the files in the directory and fixed the way we determine if the user is logged in by checking if the cookie has been set before calling hasIdentity(). <code>svn</code> updates now run at &lt;30 seconds.</p>\n"},{"tags":["svn","tortoisesvn"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":8,"up_vote_count":51,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":48462,"score":51,"question_id":1625406,"title":"Using TortoiseSVN via the command line","body":"<p>I want to use commandline SVN options.

There are many <code>svn copy</code> operations (Subversion people call them branches) in the history of my Subversion repository. The release policy has been that after each release or other branches created, the old URL is left unused and the new URL replaces the old one for containing the work.</p>\n\n<p>Optimally, by my reading, it seems like this should do the trick:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git svn clone --username=mysvnusername --authors-file=authors.txt \\\n    --follow-parent \\\n    http://svnserver/svn/src/branches/x/y/apps/module module\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(where <code>branches/x/y/</code> depicts the newest branch). But I got an error, which looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>W: Ignoring error from SVN, path probably does not exist: (160013): Filesystem has no item: '/svn/src/!svn/bc/100/branches/x/y/apps/module' path not found\nW: Do not be alarmed at the above message git-svn is just searching aggressively for old history.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The directory <code>module</code> get created and populated, but the Subversion history past the newest <code>svn copy</code> commit is not imported (the git repository created ends up having just two commits when I expected hundreds).</p>\n\n<h3>Possible Cause</h3>\n\n<p>Searching for the error message, I found this: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1493052/git-svn-anonymous-checkout-fails-with-s\">git-svn anonymous checkout fails with -s</a>\nwhich linked to this Subversion issue: <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3242\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3242</a></p>\n\n<p>What I understand by my reading, something in Subversion 1.5 changed about how the client accesses the repository. With newer Subversion, if there is no read access to some super directory of the URL path (true for me, <code>svn ls http://svnserver/svn</code> fails with <code>403 Forbidden</code>), then we fail with some Subversion operations.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution I am Looking For</h3>\n\n<p>Currently it looks like a way to go around the issue (other than downgrading my Subversion and svn libraries etc which all turns out to appear a pretty involved exercise) would be to <code>git svn fetch</code> the URLS from the oldest to newest, and combine the history together.</p>\n\n<p>I know I could make separate repositories for each URL, and then taking the history\nof each repository except for the oldest one using <code>git format-patch</code> and play the patches in the oldest repository using <code>git am</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Is there easier way to have the same effect? Is it possible to just use a single git repository, and after getting the history for one URL doing <code>git fetch</code> for the next URL in time, playing the changes on top of the previous URL history?</p>\n\n<p>(Other way of navigating around the issue is of course considered if you come up with a way.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>I do not like this, but I ended up doing <code>clone</code>  splitted into <code>init</code> and <code>fetch</code> with some editing of <code>.git/config</code> between (<code>repopath=apps/module</code>, <code>gitreponame=module</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git svn init--username=mysvnusername \\\n            --branches=/src/branches/ \\\n            --trunk=/src/trunk/${repopath} \\\n            --tags=/src/tags/ \\\n            http://svnserver/svn/src ${gitreponame}\n$ cd ${gitreponame}\n$ sed -i.bak \"s|*:|*/${repopath}:|\" .git/config\n$ git fetch --authors-file=../authors.txt --follow-parent\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I could not find how to specify the branches for subdirectory migration with <code>git svn</code> - hence the editing of the <code>.git/config</code> file. The following unified diff illustrates the effect of the editing with <code>sed</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code> [svn-remote \"svn\"]\n        url = http://svnserver/svn/src\n        fetch = trunk/apps/module:refs/remotes/trunk\n-       branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/*\n-       tags = tags/*:refs/remotes/tags/*\n+       branches = branches/*/apps/module:refs/remotes/*\n+       tags = tags/*/apps/module:refs/remotes/tags/*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As the actual desired <code>HEAD</code> was in an another URL, I ended just adding another <code>[svn-remote]</code> section to <code>.git/config</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+ [svn-remote \"svn-newest\"]\n+       url = http://svnserver/svn/src\n+       fetch = branches/x/y/apps/module:refs/remotes/trunk\n+       branches = branches/*/apps/module:refs/remotes/*\n+       tags = tags/*/apps/module:refs/remotes/tags/*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(in real life experiment I also added here some branches that were not picked up by the first fetch), and fetching again:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git svn fetch --authors-file=../authors.txt --follow-parent svn-newest\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note-1</strong> : I probably could have just told my \"trunk\" to be <code>branches/x/y/apps/module</code> as the meaning of \"trunk\" for <code>git-svn</code> seems to basically have the meaning of git HEAD (Subversion concepts of trunk, branches, tags have no deep technical basis, they are matter of socially agreed convention).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note-2</strong> : probably <code>--follow-parent</code> is not required for <code>git svn fetch</code>, but I am not going to experiment with this.</p>\n\n<p>Wish this is of some use to somebody, and wish even more that somebody would indicate a more elegant way of doing this... :-)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Earlier reading of <a href=\"https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git\" rel=\"nofollow\">svn2git</a> which seems to be a wrapper over <code>git-svn</code> I failed to see the motivation, but seeing the messy presentation of tags I kind of get it now.

I have a subversion repository which I use to store the source code for a very large PHP site. Here are some details about my setup that are important:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The dev version ot the site lives on the server at /var/www/sitename-dev, and was created by doing an svn checkout from the repository.</li>\n<li>A live version of the site lives at /var/www/sitename, and was also created with svn checkout.</li>\n<li>There is a post-commit hook set up on the repository that will run an svn update on the dev site after every commit, and an svn update on the live site if the commit log entry contains a special deployment keyword.</li>\n<li>All of the above works wonderfully and has improved the productivity of my team considerably.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The purpose of the site is to provide a set of core functionality that many companies need, and let each company who purchases our product have their own specially branded site that provides our functionality. This is accomplished using the Smarty templating engine (which is excellent). Each branded site shares the same core files (therefore fixing a bug in a core file fixes it for every site), and has a directory structure for templates located in /resources/site. Each file in /resources/site is needed, but the contents will vary from site to site.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to be able to do is create a form in the administrator section of the site that will create a new branded site as a clone of the /resources/site directory of an existing default site (in the local copy in /var/www), and add it to the subversion repository (add/commit). This will allow us to start redoing the template immediately after our next svn update. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function addNewSiteHandle($handleName){\n    try{\n        $resourceRoot = \"/var/www/site\";\n        echo \"Resource Root = \".$resourceRoot.\"&lt;br /&gt;\";\n        $resourceRoot .= \"/resources\";\n        echo \"Resource Root = \".$resourceRoot.\"&lt;br /&gt;\";\n        $this-&gt;recursiveCopy($resourceRoot.\"/rtx\", $resourceRoot.\"/\".$handleName);\n        $files = array();\n        foreach(scandir($resourceRoot.\"/\".$handleName) as $file){\n            if($file != \".\" &amp;&amp; $file != \"..\" &amp;&amp; $file != \".svn\"){\n                echo \"Processing \\\"$file\\\"&lt;br /&gt;\";\n                svn_add($resourceRoot.\"/\".$handleName.\"/\".$file, true, true);\n                array_push($files, $resourceRoot.\"/\".$handleName.\"/\".$file);\n            }\n        }\n        svn_commit(\"Handle \\\"$handleName\\\" added through the Website.\", $files);\n    }\n    catch(Exception $e){\n        error_log($e-&gt;getMessage());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This complains with the error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Wed Aug 15 14:31:01 2012] [error] [client 192.168.1.x] PHP Warning:\n  svn_add(): svn error(s) occured\\n155007 (Path is not a working copy\n  directory) '/var/www/site/resources/testtt43' is not a working\n  copy\\n in /var/www/site/Subversion.class.php on line 76,\n  referer: <a href=\"http://b1.festivadev.com/cloneTest.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://b1.festivadev.com/cloneTest.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know the site is a working copy directory, so I'm not sure what the problem is.
