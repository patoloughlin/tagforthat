I have an account with Bean Stalk, added a remote git repository there, and have successfully initiated the local git repo in Coda 2. I'm also setting up a local dev environment where I can run MAMP Pro and use thedomain.dev on my network to develop locally. The end game is to code away locally, using the local git repo, and then when I'm satisfied, pushing (correct term?) to the remote repo, which would then upload those files to the staging domain, hosted on a remote server. My old workflow involved editing files directly on the server, which is horrible. So, I am trying to do things the right way.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot find any good resources on how to do this. Again, my local git repo is working just fine. However, I want to be able to push those changes to the remote repository in Coda 2. The \"Source\" tab in the edit sites panel only has \"local\" in the dropdown and I can't change anything in it, can't figure out how to do it and can't find much help on Google. </p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?

There is now a common (bare) repository, managed by gitolite, where people push their local changes.\nI then discovered that many tags from the old CVS history were not perfectly imported. I could fix that by re-doing the migration from CVS using cvs2git (locally), and grafted the branches' heads of my first repo onto the new tree given by cvs2git (still locally). I now have a complete tree with a nicer history than before, where the heads of all the branches have the same hash as what is currently on the remote (I used grafts and filter-branch, as in this answer: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2428339/1005470\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/2428339/1005470</a>)</p>\n\n<p>What I would now like to do is to push those changes to the remote.

In the progress of development I started to have a local git repository in parallel to make it easier for me to test new features without breaking the current version. Sadly git-svn failed to work which would have make my life easier.</p>\n\n<p>Now my client switch to another server and in this process they moved the SVN repo to git (using git2svn).</p>\n\n<p>Although I'm happy about this in general, <strong>I have two problems now</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Since I worked on a bigger feature I didn't commit to SVN for 7 days. I worked in a local feature branch and made backups of that to my local server but the SVN copy which is now the remote git repo is outdated compared to my local version.</p></li>\n<li><p>Since the remote repo has been created by git2svn it is totally different from my own repo (message: Warning: Repo has no common commits.) - which makes standard merging impossible.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now my <strong>desired goals</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Merge both repos to have my current version be the checked in one and push to origin works again.</p></li>\n<li><p>Keep the history of both repos (old ones from SVN as well as the ones from the last 7 days from my git)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>What I tried so far</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I tried to clone the remote git (from svn) and merged my local repo into it. I got 153 conflicts with \"changed in both versions\". Accepting \"theirs\" (i.e. my latest developments) loses the history of the file (it just starts with the initialisation with my parallel git repo).</p>\n\n<p>My idea is that I can create a patch for each commit of the last 7 days and commit this into the new repo with the corresponding commit message (i.e. \"manual merge\"). Before I write a script to do this, I wanted to ask if there is a built-in way to do that.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I tried many solutions but every one of them failed me. The basic problem is that I have two branches now with <em>not a single common commit</em> but the <em>same tree structure</em>. This results in merge conflicts like \"added in both branches\" because git doesn't know that <code>myFile.txt\" and</code>myFile.txt\" are the same and can be merged. Instead I have to do a manual merge of the 150 files which I changed in that week - which I can't and won't do.</p>\n\n<p>My best approach so far was to create a patch for the changes and apply that to the \"new\" repo. But I didn't get around to create a patch that won't fail yet due to a tree mismatch. I have yet to find the right commit to start the patch info from.</p>\n\n<h2>Resolution</h2>\n\n<p>TL;DR: There is none. You can just choose between the lesser evil.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can use the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13289318/409349\">merge method desribed here</a> but it will replace the individual file history from the SVN with the one from your side-git (i.e. you can't lookup why this file has been changed 3 month ago if your other repo is just 2 months old). But on the positive side you still have your changes merged together in the global history via git log.</p></li>\n<li><p>The other option I ended up with was to copy and replace all the files in the \"new\" (aka SVN) repo with the current status of my git repo (via <code>cp -vru</code> but omitting the <code>.git</code>-folder and all generated files). This let me loose the history worth of one week but still let me look back into the past until the beginning of the project which I prefer.\nTo ease the pain of this loss a bit I crafted a detailed summary of my doings in the commit message using <code>git log --date=short --pretty=\"format:%cd - %s\" --name-status</code> which at least gives me the chance to go back to this entry and see a message with a description.\nBut of course this won't work for file deletions and you can't know which change actually belongs to which part of the biiiig commit message.</p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["git","svn","merge","git-svn"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":14,"score":0,"question_id":13288641,"title":"Git-svn merge and checkout --theirs","body":"<p>I unfortunately have to work with an SVN repository at work.

Then we release a <em>patch version</em>, 1.2.4A.</li>\n<li>patches are rather exceptional. We usually do no more than 1-2 patches for the minor release.

I don't want the entire repo, just the one folder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/using-merge-subtree.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The subtree merge strategy</a> won't work because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only one subtree is supported; when you do the pull for the subtree (git pull -s subtree...) it only updates the one at the highest level (no matter the order in which they were created).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now bear in mind I am new to git so it's possible the above conclusions are wrong. But this is what I have discovered through both research and experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>The possible solution I have come up with is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a branch for Project1.</li>\n<li>Delete everything I don't want from this branch.</li>\n<li>Move the files I DO want to the root of this branch.</li>\n<li>Delete Subfolder.</li>\n<li>Add this branch as a submodule to Project1+.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This sorta-kinda worked. I modified the Project1 master branch and was able to merge the changes into the new branch, and therefore update the submodule, but this seems unnecessarily complex (given how easy it is in SVN). Furthermore when I merged the changes in Project1 it seemed to consider the deleted files as conflicted; i.e. it was just a huge PITA to update Project1. Maybe I need a different merge strategy?</p>\n\n<p>But mainly I'm asking is this even the right path at all?</p>\n\n<p>For the record, this is trivially easy with SVN Externals. So the use-case is there. And I realize it's entirely possible no one is doing this with git. The explanations I can find online after a couple days of research all boil down to \"restructure your projects so each repo has what you want to share\"; i.e. \"Subfolder\" from Project1 becomes its own repo. I'm hoping that's not really the final answer.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["git"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13274557,"title":"Diff content changes across renames","body":"<p>My project history looks like this:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Edit files a, b</li>\n<li>Commit, rev1</li>\n<li>Rename files a, b -> c, d</li>\n<li>Commit, rev2</li>\n<li>Edit files c, d</li>\n<li>Commit, rev3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I want to view a diff of what the edits I made to the two files across these commits, but <code>git diff rev0..rev3</code> isn't helpful because I just see the deletion of files a &amp; b, and all of the edits to c &amp; d as one big add mixed in with the creation of the files. </p>\n\n<p>How can I see a diff including rev1 and rev3 where ((a,c), (b,d)) are treated as the same files, without the file rename clutter in the diff?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","metadata","file-permissions"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10,"score":0,"question_id":13275000,"title":"Can anybody explain how use git-cache-meta?","body":"<p>I want keep directories permission in a git repo and seem to me that one easy way is using git-cache-meta, but I really can't found out there a simple \"git-cache-meta how-to\", can anybody give me some example and a minimal explanation of how use it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","diff","gitk"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":2,"question_id":13196045,"title":"git diff does not create temp files","body":"<p>I am experiencing something a bit weird when using git.

I'm following <a href=\"http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> workflow and this topic is just going to start with the initialization and creating feature branches then when I'm confident with that I'll create a new topic for Releases and Hotfixes. Hopefully this will help other people to who are looking to use GIT in a similar workflow.</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 developers, let's call them A, B and C who will all work on their local machine, we have 4 remote servers - 'Development', 'Staging', 'Production' and Unfuddle (as the centralized server). Developer A has the directory of files on their local machine.</p>\n\n<p>So, i'm thinking the workflow will be as follows.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I need to create the repository on Unfuddle and locally then push my files to the Unfuddle server.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a repository in Unfuddle called 'website' and give it the abbreviation 'web'</li>\n<li>Create an SSH Keypair on 'Development', 'Staging' and 'Production' servers and add them to Unfuddle account.</li>\n<li><p>Developer A initializes a Git repository in their document root:</p>\n\n<p><code>git init</code> </p></li>\n<li><p>Associate the Unfuddle repository with developer A's local one and designate it as an upstream server:</p>\n\n<p><code>git remote add unfuddle git@subdomain.unfuddle.com:username/web.git</code></p>\n\n<p><code>git config remote.unfuddle.push refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Developer A adds all files to index</p>\n\n<p><code>git add *</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Developer A commits all files</p>\n\n<p><code>git commit -am 'initial commit'</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Developer A pushes locally made commits to Unfuddle Git repository.</p>\n\n<p><code>git push unfuddle master</code></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I should now see all of my files within my Unfuddle repository. Developers B and C may now clone the repository to get a copy of the website files.</p>\n\n<pre><code>`git clone git@subdomain.unfuddle.com:username/web.git`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Feature Branches:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each developer can now begin creating feature branches using the following workflow:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>git checkout -b develop</code> </li>\n<li><code>git checkout -b feature\\test develop</code> </li>\n<li>Make any code changes </li>\n<li><code>git commit -a -m \"Make test code changes\"</code> </li>\n<li><code>git checkout develop</code> </li>\n<li><code>git merge --no-ff feature\\test</code> </li>\n<li><code>git branch -d feature\\test</code> </li>\n<li><code>git push unfuddle develop</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>OK so the next part I'm unsure of. We have pushed the feature changes to the centralized Unfuddle server, however the other developers need to get the changes, therefore would they need to create a 'develop' branch and then do <code>git pull unfuddle develop</code>? I've read a fetch and merge is better than pull, is this the case? If so, would it be <code>git fetch unfuddle develop</code> then <code>git merge develop</code> ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","cygwin","github"],"answer_count":13,"favorite_count":89,"up_vote_count":124,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":78929,"score":124,"question_id":3777075,"title":"HTTPS github access","body":"<p>I'm stuck behind a firewall so have to use https to access my github repository.

For this reason is it not wise to put huge amounts of content into one single repository (thanks for <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/899373/transferring-legacy-code-base-from-cvs-to-distributed-repository-e-g-git-or-mer/899428#899428\">this answer</a>). I know that this a not a bug but a feature, but I wonder whether this is a requirement for all distributed revision control systems.</p>\n\n<p>In distributed rcs the history of a file (or a chunk of content) is a directed acyclic graph, so why can't you just clone this single DAG instead of the set of all graphs in the repository? Maybe I miss something but the following use-cases are hard to do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clone only a part of a repository</li>\n<li>merge two repositories (preserving their histories!)</li>\n<li>copy some files with their history from one repository to another</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I reuse parts of other people's code from multiple projects I cannot preserve their full history. At least in git I can think of a (rather complex) workaround:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>clone a full repository</li>\n<li>delete all content that I am not interested in</li>\n<li>rewrite the history to delete everything that is not in the master</li>\n<li>merge the remaining repository into an existing repository</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is also possible with Mercurial or Bazaar but at least it is not easy at all. So is there any distributed rcs that supports partial checkout/clone by design? It should support one simple command to get a single file with its history from one repository and merge it into another. This way you would not need to think about how to structure your content into repositories and submodules but you could happily split and merge repositories as needed (the extreme would be one repository for each single file).</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","gitignore"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":105,"score":0,"question_id":13208833,"title":"How do I ignore files with a .gitignore file?","body":"<p>Always when I run <code>git status</code> some files are listed as untracked, that is how it should be.

The existing filesystem was within Dropbox, so I performed the same setup on the two other machines that use the filesystem (now a git repo).</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I tried to get JGit to add a file, commit it and then push it. Here's the gist of the code up until the point it breaks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FileRepositoryBuilder builder = new FileRepositoryBuilder();\n        Repository repository = builder.setGitDir(new File(\"path/to/my/repo\"))\n          .readEnvironment() // scan environment GIT_* variables\n          .findGitDir() // scan up the file system tree\n          .build();\n\n    Git git = new Git(repository);\n    AddCommand add = git.add();\n    try{\n        add.addFilepattern(\"PlayState.as\").call();`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is basically taken verbatim from a JGit tutorial, incidentally.

I get that a bare repo is one with just git in and no other files, but it seems to me that now it has files in it. I've already manually added, committed and pushed to github using git from Terminal. So I can't immediately see why it won't even recognise the repo.</p>\n\n<p>Any takers?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - For clarification, killing off this repo is no big deal if someone can propose another solution.

The odd one out is &lt;long_filename&gt; which is listed as a merge instead of a deletion. Still, no files are visible in the directory I cloned to after the reset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can view all the wiki entries that should be present by using gitk from the cloned folder, but I am quite certain that the files are not present in a raw format anywhere on my filesystem, otherwise \"find / -name &lt;filename&gt; 2>/dev/null\" should return some useful output.</p>\n\n<p><strong>update 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apparently one of my filenames is too long for git to manage.

XCode will recreate a reference to the Project with the correct Capitalization.  Note that the renaming of the directory seems to force XCode to recognize the new directory name when the repository is recreated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another way to resolve the issue is:</strong> within XCode's Organizer window (select the Repositories Tab), delete the reference to the repository.  Then, still in Organizer, select the \"Projects\" tab at top.  To the left of the project's window is a list of all the projects...select MyProjectName.  Now in the center frame is a field named \"Derived Data\" with a path to your project.  Click the little -> arrow to the right of the PATH to open up the Project's Internal Settings Directory in Finder.  Open the file called \"info.plist\" and edit the key \"WorkspacePath\" such that it's value EXACTLY MATCHES the location of your project (correct the capitalization of the directory if necessary).  Save, and return to Organizer.  Close XCode.  Reopen XCode and the repository reference will be recreated.  You can go directly into Organizer now, select the \"Repositories\" tab, then select MyProjectName's repository.  You'll see the commit messages there (even if you haven't committed yet, you'll still see the auto-generated 'first-commit' that occurred internally when your project was created).</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","githooks","pre-commit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":122,"score":4,"question_id":7495819,"title":"How to test current commit and not the working tree?","body":"<p>I am trying to set up a pre-commit hook to test my project before any commit goes through, but I can't find how to make sure that only HEAD (with patches from the current commit) are tested and not the current working_tree (which in most cases is dirty for me).</p>\n\n<p>Solutions found:</p>\n\n<p>Found this link and ended up doing the following.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://newartisans.com/2009/02/building-a-better-pre-commit-hook-for-git/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://newartisans.com/2009/02/building-a-better-pre-commit-hook-for-git/</a></p>\n\n<pre><code># Checkout a copy of the current index into MIRROR\ngit checkout-index --prefix=$TMPDIR/ -af\n\n# Remove files from MIRROR which are no longer present in the index\ngit diff-index --cached --name-only --diff-filter=D -z HEAD | \\\n   (cd $TMPDIR &amp;&amp; xargs -0 rm -f --)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["git","continuous-integration","hudson","github","jenkins"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":9,"up_vote_count":29,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10734,"score":29,"question_id":5212304,"title":"Authenticate Jenkins CI for Github private repository","body":"<p>I'd like for Jenkins to automagically fetch data from my private repository hosted on Github.\nBut I have no idea how to accomplish that task..

There are a couple different site \"designs\" and for each design, there's a couple cookie-cutter type versions of the same thing.

Mainly, what I want to be able to do is quickly and easily update the common files.

This problem has had me stressed out for quite some time now and there doesn't seem to be any clear solution, other than forcing non-windows machines to use the file permissions windows seems to inflict.</p>\n\n<p>Let's begin with the scenario. I have 2 development machines, one running Windows7, the other Mac OSX. They both are using Eclipse and EGit, and both have cloned the same project from a remote repo. That's where the similarities end, because my windows machine has a nasty habit of retaining a file mode of <strong>644</strong> (r-xr--r--) on its local repo, while the mode on the Mac defaults to a cool <strong>775</strong> (rwxrwxr--x).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem's obviously the file permissions - GIT reports there are files that have changed due to differences in file modes and not actual content. The solution seemed obvious, run the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code> git config core.filemode false\n git config --global core.filemode false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which worked like a charm, <em>except</em> when committing and merging resolved <em>conflicts</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say files A, B and C exist on both the Windows and Mac repos. Next, let's change the file mode for these 3 files on the Mac machine so that the developer can edit them. Now change some of the contents in file A. Because we're ignoring the file modes (thanks to the commands above) only file A will be committed and pushed, ready for the Windows machine to fetch, merge and enjoy...</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's edit file A again on the Mac <em>and</em> on the Windows machines, effectively causing a potential conflict, and let the Windows machine commit and push file A first. Then, when the Mac user commits their changes to file A and fetches the latest changes from the remote repo, a conflict is obviously created.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving the conflict on the Mac machine and adding file A back to their local repo, committing that merge includes the previously ignored files B and C, and thus highlighting my problem! Why are the previously ignored files being included in this merge commit? This doesn't seem to be a Mac / Windows problem exclusively, as this problem can be recreated both ways...</p>\n\n<p>This probably wouldn't matter if there were only 3 files, but this project I'm referring to includes thousands, and all these up and down push and pulls are insane.

I have a more specific requirement and general question. The specific requirement is that I want to use Git. The more general question is, how should documents (for design, test, general practices, tips, etc, of a project) be stored in Git? More broadly, what documents should be stored?</p>\n\n<p>I can think of a few ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Word / Open Office documents. The new Office Word has docx format, which zips up documents, but it also has an unzipped XML format, which could be used to efficiently store diffs in Git. The diff feature is still broken though, since the XMLs are squished on a single line. This is no better than storing a binary file into Git.</li>\n<li>Wiki. What distributed wikis exist out there? It'd be like some kind of Latex thing where documents are written and compiled / viewed as a wiki.</li>\n<li>Latex - but from using it for papers I find it pretty unsuitable for documents. Is there a documentation equivalent? (How are man pages written?)</li>\n<li>Plain text formats, but this is rather lacking due to lack of diagrams, which bring up another point.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How should visuals be stored? What should they be composed in in the first place? I'm developing on a Linux environment, but some other participants in the project are on Windows. What cross-platform solution is there that resembles Visio? And of course, it should not create binary files to be stored into Git. How then would this tie in with documentation? (E.g. Similar to how Latex can reference other diagrams when compiled.)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","github","markdown"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1005,"score":9,"question_id":10189356,"title":"How to add screenshot to READMEs?","body":"<p>Is it possible to place a screenshot in README file in a GitHub repository?

Is there a git workflow that allows this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: Based on Karl Bielefeldt's answer the <code>git checkout --orphan</code> should be the right answer. But one still needs to 'clone' that branch alone to the new user, and be able to push it effectively.</p>\n\n<p>The man page states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [[-b|-B|--orphan] &lt;new_branch&gt;] [&lt;start_point&gt;] --orphan</code></p>\n  \n  <p>Create a new orphan branch, named <code>&lt;new_branch&gt;</code>, started from\n  <code>&lt;start_point&gt;</code>  and switch to it. The first commit made on this new\n  branch will have no  parents and it will be the root of a new history\n  totally disconnected from  all the other branches and commits.</p>\n  \n  <p>The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously\n  run <code>git checkout &lt;start_point&gt;</code>. This allows you to start a new\n  history that  records a set of paths similar to <code>&lt;start_point&gt;</code> by\n  easily running <code>git  commit -a</code> to make the root commit.</p>\n  \n  <p>This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit\n  without  exposing its full history. You might want to do this to\n  publish an open  source branch of a project whose current tree is\n  \"clean\", but whose full  history contains proprietary or otherwise\n  encumbered bits of code.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of\n  paths that  is totally different from the one of <code>&lt;start_point&gt;</code>, then\n  you should clear  the index and the working tree right after creating\n  the orphan branch by  running <code>git rm -rf .</code> from the top level of the\n  working tree. Afterwards  you will be ready to prepare your new files,\n  repopulating the working tree,  by copying them from elsewhere,\n  extracting a tarball, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>VonC's link to Junio's comments is interesting. I think the manual should provide the guidance in this case, and allow the right command [e.g. <code>clone &lt;branch&gt; --options</code>] to extract just the relevant part of the repo. Obviously the probability of <code>push</code> success is increased by having a few linked commits and SHA1s at the bottom of the history that will lock down the repo matching.</p>\n"},{"tags":["git"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":11,"up_vote_count":18,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":574,"score":18,"question_id":6436681,"title":"How to stage only part of a new file with git?","body":"<p>I <strong>love</strong> <em>git add --interactive</em>.

I'm using git as\nI want to have it's awesome little local branches for everything and rebasing on each other.</p>\n\n<p>I also need to update from central repo often, so using separate svn/git is not an option.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is - <code>git svn --help</code> (man page) says that it is not a good idea to use <code>git merge</code> into <em>master</em> branch (which is set to track from svn's <em>trunk</em>) from local branches, as this will ruin the party and <code>git svn dcommit</code> would not work anymore.</p>\n\n<p>I know that it's not exactly true and you may use <code>git merge</code> if you are merging from \nbranch which was properly rebased on <em>master</em> prior merge, but I'm trying to make it safer and actually use <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git am</code>. We are using code review, so I'm making patches anyway. I also knew about <code>git cherry-pick</code>, but I want to just <code>git am /reviewed/patches/dir/*</code> without actually recalling what commits was corresponding to this patches (without reading patches, that is).</p>\n\n<p>So, what's wrong with <code>git svn</code> and <code>git am</code>? It's simple - <code>git am</code> for a few very hard points is doing <em>CRLF</em> into <em>LF</em> conversion for patches supplied (<code>git-mailsplit</code> is doing this, to be precise), if not rebasing. <code>git format-patch</code> is also producing proper (LF-ended) patches.</p>\n\n<p>As my repo is mostly <em>CRLF</em> (and it should remain so), patches are, obviously, failing due to wrong EOL. Converting diffs to <em>CRLF</em> and somehow hacking <code>git am</code> to prevent it from conversion is not working, too. It will fail if any file was removed or deleted - <code>git apply</code> will complain about expected /dev/null (but he got <code>/dev/null^M</code>).</p>\n\n<p>And if I'm applying it with <code>git am --ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace</code> that it will\ncommit LF endings straight to the index, which is also weird. I don't know if it will preserve over commiting into svn (via <code>git svn dcommit</code>) and checking it out and I don't want to try out.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it's still possible to try hacking around patches to convert only actual diffs, but this is too much hacks for simple task.</p>\n\n<p>So, I wonder, is there really no established way to produce patches and apply them to the same repo on the same system?

Experimental is adding a fairly large new feature.  </p>\n\n<p>The main problem I'm having is that developers working on Stable don't also put their changes in Experimental.  As I'm working on Experimental, I have to merge both branches.  </p>\n\n<p>I've been using Git by myself for about a year, and it's worked great with one branch (Stable), as I can just:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git checkout master\n&lt;copy all Stable files over, which will add changes&gt;\ngit commit -a -m \"Updated files 06/19/2011\"\ngit checkout New_Feature\ngit rebase master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This updates all my files with the changes from Stable.  However, now that they are using two development branches, I'm getting a lot of merge conflicts.

They are often targeted at guys who just want to use git and hack locally, without using the full power of git, like pull, fetch, merge and the like between multiple developers who would all have cloned the svn repository with git-svn, then still expect to be able to push their changes anytime to the (official) svn repository, and get back to working in git and sharing their stuff etc.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever these articles admit you can't do everything you'd do in pure git, the consequences and possible screw ups are never clearly explained (or maybe it's juste me ?). Even the git-svn man page mentions caveats, but not really in an extensive manner.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what I've read, I feel there could be problems when git-svn is used in that specific way, which I'll describe below. Can someone tell me if I'm right about this ?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the \"wanted\" way of doing things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We have a project in a svn repository</li>\n<li>Developer A git-svn-clone's the svn repo.

I read some time ago, in a git book I think, that git-svn-clone could create git repositories that are of course a \"mirror\" of the svn repo, but that git repos created that way by different developers would have different \"ids\" and commits would have different hashes. So my understanding was that those git repos wouldn't share any common git ancestor, and thus wouldn't be able to use all the git commands you need to share, merge, and so on. Is it true, are we gonna face problems with this workflow ?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I read this could be done, using at least an \"official\" bare git repository, that would be the only one to be git-svn-cloned, and all git users would have to start form this one. Then you need someone who is in charge of this central git repo, and gathers the changes between the git devs, before dcommiting everything to the svn repo. This would be the only way for git users to be \"unaware\" that the original git repo comes from svn, and would let them use all git commands as they like. The only person who would need to be fluent in both git and svn (and know about git-svn caveats) would be the \"merge manager\" (or whatever he's called).</p>\n\n<p>Am I completely misunderstanding git-svn caveats ?

I am using Redmine for a issue tracking system for my upcoming project and I recently did the install on Heroku and I was wondering if there was a good way to use Git via a github repository to do issue tracking (ie. I can make a commit, do a refs #issue_number and it would associate that commit with the issue I'm tracking). I know there is some way to do it with svn, but we want to use git for the project. I heard that heroku is unable to do Redmine with git from someone since you need a 'bare' and 'minimum' directory? (or something similar to that) Is this true? or is there a guide out there (I've been googling 'git with heroku and redmine' and other variants for the last little bit with no luck) on installing git to associate it with my github repository for my heroku based Redmine?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced!</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","github"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1796,"score":1,"question_id":10922028,"title":"Github: ERROR: Repository not found. fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly (different from similar posts apparently)","body":"<p>I created a directory <code>hello_git</code>.

These all exist in a single www folder which happens to be the top level directory for all three projects. I would like to cleanly integrate all of these into their respective repositories, but the only solutions for multiple repositories in a single directory that I have found are submodules (which I love the idea of, but as far as I can tell require each project to be in a subfolder of the main Git repo) and symlinking the files into place (should work, but a bit messy and rather annoying to keep up).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a clean way to get this done? Here is an example of my folder structure. I have denoted in which repo(s) each file/directory resides - M = Magento, B = Boilerplate, P = Private:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/www\n   |-- app [M]\n       |-- frontend [M]\n           |-- base [M]\n           |-- magento-boilerplate [B]\n               |-- default [B]\n               |-- myprivatetheme [P]\n   |-- skin [M]\n       |-- frontend [M]\n           |-- base [M]\n           |-- magento-boilerplate [B]\n               |-- default [B]\n               |-- myprivatetheme [P]\n   |-- .htaccess [M][B][P]\n   |-- favicon.ico [M][P]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, even without the whole .htaccess and favicon.ico being in multiple repositories mess (I would just gitignore or --assume-unchanged them in the Magento and Boilerplate repos and use my private one for them) the top level directory is www due to the way that Magento splits code and themes into separate folders with a common parent of www. Due to that you can even technically say that the app, skin, and various frontend folders exist in multiple repos as well, since they must exist in each repo all the way up to the top level directory for structure.</p>\n\n<p>Is sym-linking these repos in from separate folders my only solution? It's not a huge problem, but I would be really interested to know if Git is flexible enough to deal with my case.

The central directory domain will be test.development. When they come to committing any changes to the central repository they will SSH into the server and commit their changes and when we want to update the central repository we will pull these changes to get the latest version which can then be viewed at test.development.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the right method of doing things or should we all have a local LAMP stack installed (apart from the designer who uses Windows) and have our repositories locally? If so, should the central repo still be on the rackspace server?

I will try to explain the situation as clear as possible:</p>\n\n<p>I have a remote VPS that runs my live website on www.example.com and the development version on dev.example.com (they reside in /var/www/example/htdocs/ and /var/www/example/subdomains/dev/). </p>\n\n<p>Development is run from a bare repository in /opt/git/example.git/. There is a master and development branch in the bare repo. Me and the other developer both have a clone of this repository on our local machine. We pull from the development branch and work from there. The idea is that dev.example.com has up to date code from the development branch and once that is properly tested, we merge into master, add a tag and update example.com (basically, this <a href=\"http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\">git flow</a>). </p>\n\n<p>The first approach I found on the Git IRC channel uses hooks to update repositories, but this feels very limitting and sometimes also unwanted, I'd like to run a command on the server myself after pushing, that updates the development environment. Another command (or shell script) would update the live site from the master branch after development has been merged). I also found Capistrano, but that seems a little over my head at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>While reading, I found a lot of people suggesting to create two more clones on the remote: one for the live site and one for the development site, pulling in branches when necessary. This however also leaves the version control files accessible via the web, which is something I don't want. Ideally, I want a \"clean\" copy without any git files or folders.</p>\n\n<p>I also found an approach using git archive, but running git archive from my bare repository only allows me to archive the master branch. I do this using the command <code>git archive --format=tar HEAD | (cd /var/www/example/htdocs/ &amp;&amp; tar xf -)</code> in /opt/git/example.git/.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like the <code>git archive</code> approach brings me closest to an answer, but I am limited by my lack of Git knowledge. Can I alter the command to use a branch instead of HEAD (when I tried using origin/master instead of HEAD, I got an error)?

To achieve this, I downloaded the Orchard.Source distro instead of the Orchard.Web distro.</p>\n\n<p>So, I used GIT to publish the Orchard.Source.1.5.1 distro from a repository on my local machine to an Azure web site (preview technology).  The deployment worked, but the subsequent build on Azure failed because it could not determine which solution was \"the one\" it should build:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>remote: Unable to determine which solution file to build. \n    C:\\DWASFiles\\Sites\\MySite\\VirtualDirectory0\\site\\repository\\src\\Orchard.sln, \n    C:\\DWASFiles\\Sites\\MySite\\VirtualDirectory0\\site\\repository\\src\\Orchard.Azure\\Orchard.Azure.sln, \n    C:\\DWASFiles\\Sites\\MySite\\VirtualDirectory0\\site\\repository\\src\\Orchard.Azure\\Orchard.Azure.Web\\Modules\\Orchard.ContentTypes\\Orchard.ContentTypes.sln, \n    C:\\DWASFiles\\Sites\\MySite\\VirtualDirectory0\\site\\repository\\src\\Orchard.Azure.Tests\\Orchard.Azure.Tests.sln, \n    C:\\DWASFiles\\Sites\\MySite\\VirtualDirectory0\\site\\repository\\src\\Orchard.Web\\Modules\\Orchard.ContentTypes\\Orchard.ContentTypes.sln.\n    remote: Error - Changes committed to remote repository but your website not updated.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first solution Azure listed in that dump is the one it should be using.  How do I tell that to Azure?</p>\n\n<p>With help from David Ebbo, I now understand that I was asking the wrong question:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the problem is solved with a '.deployment' configuration file and </li>\n<li><p>pointing to the \"correct\" Visual Stuio solution is incorrect!  To deploy to Azure through GIT, I must point to a project file (in this case, Orchard.Web.csproj):</p>\n\n<p>[config]<br>\nproject = src/Orchard.Web/Orchard.Web.csproj</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This gets me further along, but my next problem is that I intentionally omitted the 'lib' folder of Orchard.Source from my GIT repository.  I figured, wrongly, that if I enabled \"nuget restore\" for the Orchard.sln, the build of the project files in Azure would fetch needed dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of Sebastien, I now understand enabling nuget may be an uphill battle because some number of Orchard 3rd party dependencies have had source-level customizations by the Orchard team.  In short, if I want to get up and running quickly with the Orchard.Source distro - then I need to simply commit the 'lib' folder into my GIT repository (darn!).</p>\n\n<p>When I did my next push to Azure through GIT, my compilation still failed - but at least the number of errors were reduced dramatically.  I think the only thing it is upset with now is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>For OrchardFramework.csproj:\n   Could not find assemblies: Castle.Core, Casstle.DynamicProxy2\n   Missing type or namespace: Castle, AbstractLoggerFactory, DefaultProxyBuilder\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I can overcome this issue, I might finally have the best of boths worlds: a Visual Studio development environment (due to the Orchard.Source distro) and a GIT-enabled push to Azure.  Anyone know what this last issue might be?</p>\n\n<p>p.s. there is a \"ClickToBuildAzurePackage.cmd\" file in the Orchard.Source distro, which was created before the \"GIT push to Azure\" was created.  That little batch file attempts to duplicate much of the work that a GIT push to Azure now offers.  I may explore that option more, but of course the ideal situation would be to rely on the new Azure built-in capabilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: It turns out this is simply because <code>lib/*/Castle Windsor 2.0/bin/*</code> is being ignored by <code>.gitignore</code>.  Having forced those files in as well, the whole thing now builds and deploys!  Only issue now is the site does not give a response when I visit it.

First, here's what is seen on the developer non-bare (contains working copy) repository:</p>\n\n<p>git branch</p>\n\n<pre><code>* master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>git branch -a</p>\n\n<pre><code>* master\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master\n  remotes/origin/master\n  remotes/origin/rebuild\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>git ls-remote .</p>\n\n<pre><code>3403cde92193332e5a86c0ee1001652217f14b2c    HEAD\n3403cde92193332e5a86c0ee1001652217f14b2c    refs/heads/master\n70dc401eb10191f9c025e8e1883c3e281b52e066    refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\n70dc401eb10191f9c025e8e1883c3e281b52e066    refs/remotes/origin/master\n4c8d40b286c00c876bfcbcc31cd92aa32bb970fc    refs/remotes/origin/rebuild\n78df712072ede26debe1a86609e92950643b554c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-10\n8278623b80f3abac676992a656a1022d387d9543    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-11\n3b20e4b64adc53ca7d1687a7583665d6119dc0c5    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-12\nee1b8b37951baa8b9894d8158d0f8524c649560f    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-13\n79567390f4107a1d069c5b225a7949689adeb84e    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-14\n1ac143798b92b6e9bc575a9e1c2feb118d986656    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-15\n96f8ffef3262136d090f6499b964f1aeadedf110    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-16\naf49a2dcd48d95957c13ec2b396f588b9ad3700c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-17\ned5cf3d5aa9d3bc7897a62c348fd30fd3a540f6e    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-18\nd72672c1c5b42d2a1f5bac83348265ef4702230a    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-19\n9b14a5b49ef0f775fa95daaf9be1cdf83e48f6e7    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-20\nb0a7d1b19d68b31db17702222977cf86503782a1    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-21\n51b583583e31bdcfceb6f43863dc456982b87b6c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-22\n38a68987f1f77e1ebe2898ae612af4c75a3276aa    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-6\n829692b020d5227270d946744f63e693eada22ad    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-7\n146c7426f68c5bf45365d72285eb2badfa1e26dc    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-8\nb8ef169cbfa6a94ad63e039811a1c4429eb7628b    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-9\nb3b0f04b541b18b47819c65b3e63a242e0819e2a    refs/tags/pressflow-6.22.105\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now on the internal shared bare repository, if I run the same commands I get something different:</p>\n\n<p>git branch</p>\n\n<pre><code>* master\n  rebuild\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>git branch -a</p>\n\n<pre><code>* master\n  rebuild\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>git ls-remote .</p>\n\n<pre><code>70dc401eb10191f9c025e8e1883c3e281b52e066    HEAD\n70dc401eb10191f9c025e8e1883c3e281b52e066    refs/heads/master\n4c8d40b286c00c876bfcbcc31cd92aa32bb970fc    refs/heads/rebuild\n78df712072ede26debe1a86609e92950643b554c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-10\n8278623b80f3abac676992a656a1022d387d9543    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-11\n3b20e4b64adc53ca7d1687a7583665d6119dc0c5    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-12\nee1b8b37951baa8b9894d8158d0f8524c649560f    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-13\n79567390f4107a1d069c5b225a7949689adeb84e    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-14\n1ac143798b92b6e9bc575a9e1c2feb118d986656    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-15\n96f8ffef3262136d090f6499b964f1aeadedf110    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-16\naf49a2dcd48d95957c13ec2b396f588b9ad3700c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-17\ned5cf3d5aa9d3bc7897a62c348fd30fd3a540f6e    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-18\nd72672c1c5b42d2a1f5bac83348265ef4702230a    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-19\n9b14a5b49ef0f775fa95daaf9be1cdf83e48f6e7    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-20\nb0a7d1b19d68b31db17702222977cf86503782a1    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-21\n51b583583e31bdcfceb6f43863dc456982b87b6c    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-22\n38a68987f1f77e1ebe2898ae612af4c75a3276aa    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-6\n829692b020d5227270d946744f63e693eada22ad    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-7\n146c7426f68c5bf45365d72285eb2badfa1e26dc    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-8\nb8ef169cbfa6a94ad63e039811a1c4429eb7628b    refs/tags/DRUPAL-6-9\nb3b0f04b541b18b47819c65b3e63a242e0819e2a    refs/tags/pressflow-6.22.105\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["git","version-control","github","git-svn"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":29,"score":0,"question_id":12706719,"title":"Create User & Access Rules Github for Windows","body":"<p>I've just installed Git using <a href=\"http://windows.github.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://windows.github.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>It seems to be installed correctly but I'm unable to create new users and access control setup to access repository.
