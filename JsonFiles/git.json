Within Project1 there is a subfolder that I want to include in Project1+ (Project2, Project3, etc.) By \"include\" I don't mean copy-and-paste. I want a reference to Project1 so that if I make changes to Project1 I can automatically integrate those changes in Projects1+.  Further, I want to place it in <em>more than one</em> location within Project1+.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Project1\n|-Subfolder1\n  |-Stuff I want...\n|-README.md\n\nProject2\n|-Subfolder1 &lt;- from Project1\n|-SomeOtherFolder\n  |-Subfolder1 &lt;- from Project1\n|-README.md\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Git submodules won't work because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The submoldule is the entire repo, not the subfolder.

I modified the Project1 master branch and was able to merge the changes into the new branch, and therefore update the submodule, but this seems unnecessarily complex (given how easy it is in SVN). Furthermore when I merged the changes in Project1 it seemed to consider the deleted files as conflicted; i.e. it was just a huge PITA to update Project1. Maybe I need a different merge strategy?</p>\n\n<p>But mainly I'm asking is this even the right path at all?</p>\n\n<p>For the record, this is trivially easy with SVN Externals. So the use-case is there. And I realize it's entirely possible no one is doing this with git. The explanations I can find online after a couple days of research all boil down to \"restructure your projects so each repo has what you want to share\"; i.e. \"Subfolder\" from Project1 becomes its own repo.

It is pointless running a fetch command without actually knowing what has been changed.</p>\n\n<p>I am as much of a git novice as they come, so perhaps I have missed a crucial step.

For this reason is it not wise to put huge amounts of content into one single repository (thanks for <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/899373/transferring-legacy-code-base-from-cvs-to-distributed-repository-e-g-git-or-mer/899428#899428\">this answer</a>). I know that this a not a bug but a feature, but I wonder whether this is a requirement for all distributed revision control systems.</p>\n\n<p>In distributed rcs the history of a file (or a chunk of content) is a directed acyclic graph, so why can't you just clone this single DAG instead of the set of all graphs in the repository? Maybe I miss something but the following use-cases are hard to do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clone only a part of a repository</li>\n<li>merge two repositories (preserving their histories!)</li>\n<li>copy some files with their history from one repository to another</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I reuse parts of other people's code from multiple projects I cannot preserve their full history. At least in git I can think of a (rather complex) workaround:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>clone a full repository</li>\n<li>delete all content that I am not interested in</li>\n<li>rewrite the history to delete everything that is not in the master</li>\n<li>merge the remaining repository into an existing repository</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is also possible with Mercurial or Bazaar but at least it is not easy at all. So is there any distributed rcs that supports partial checkout/clone by design? It should support one simple command to get a single file with its history from one repository and merge it into another. This way you would not need to think about how to structure your content into repositories and submodules but you could happily split and merge repositories as needed (the extreme would be one repository for each single file).</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","gitignore"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":102,"score":0,"question_id":13208833,"title":"How do I ignore files with a .gitignore file?","body":"<p>Always when I run <code>git status</code> some files are listed as untracked, that is how it should be.

It throws an exception at that last quoted line and states:</p>\n\n<pre><code>org.eclipse.jgit.errors.NoWorkTreeException: Bare Repository has neither a working tree, nor an index\nat org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository.getIndexFile(Repository.java:838)\nat org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository.lockDirCache(Repository.java:886)\nat org.eclipse.jgit.api.AddCommand.call(AddCommand.java:136)\nat flipa.FLIPAGame.writeToFlixel(FLIPAGame.java:77)\nat flipa.FLIPAGame.main(FLIPAGame.java:58)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I'm not saying it's unreasonable to claim that, because truth be told I am not the best friend of version control. I get that a bare repo is one with just git in and no other files, but it seems to me that now it has files in it. I've already manually added, committed and pushed to github using git from Terminal. So I can't immediately see why it won't even recognise the repo.</p>\n\n<p>Any takers?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - For clarification, killing off this repo is no big deal if someone can propose another solution. I want a git repo to use the filesystem in my dropbox, and be able to commit to github via Java.</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","dropbox"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":185,"score":0,"question_id":12773488,"title":"Git fatal: Reference has invalid format: 'refs/heads/master","body":"<p>I am using <code>Dropbox</code> to sync a <code>git</code> repository, but now when I try and <code>push</code> I am getting an error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fatal: Reference has invalid format: 'refs/heads/master (MacBook-Pro's conflicted copy 2012-10-07)'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it seems that Dropbox detected a conflict and created a copy.

The odd one out is &lt;long_filename&gt; which is listed as a merge instead of a deletion. Still, no files are visible in the directory I cloned to after the reset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can view all the wiki entries that should be present by using gitk from the cloned folder, but I am quite certain that the files are not present in a raw format anywhere on my filesystem, otherwise \"find / -name &lt;filename&gt; 2>/dev/null\" should return some useful output.</p>\n\n<p><strong>update 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apparently one of my filenames is too long for git to manage.

Running XCode 4.0.2 on a 2008 black macbook.  <strong>If anyone has insight, please share.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This was the issue.</strong>\nI create a new project, save it to the directory ~/Documents/CODE/...here-or-a-subdirectory-therein, making sure to check the \"create local git repository\" checkbox.  I make a small edit to the AppDelegate or any other file, and Source Control commits will not work from within XCode.  From the command-line, I see that .git was created in the project directory, and that the 'first commit' occurred.  I can perform git commits from the command-line.<br>\n<strong>Possibly related issue:</strong> in Organizer->repositories, all my repositories have the yellow stoplight icon (even those I've gotten to work).  </p>\n\n<p><strong>This was the Error:</strong>\nWhen I try to commit from the project window (File-->SourceControl-->Commit, type a comment, and press commit) I get the following error:\nThe Working copy of \"MyProjectName\" failed to commit files.\nfatal: '/Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/MyProjectName/MyProjectNameAppDelegate.m' is outside repository.</p>\n\n<p>Over in the Organizer, I select MyProjectName (with the drop-down arrow and icon of the repository safe).  The location is displayed as /Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/\nBut in the area where the commit comments are normally displayed, I see the message \"Unable to load revisions\".</p>\n\n<p>The likely cause was that XCode was internally identifying the Project directory as ~/Documents/Code, not ~/Documents/CODE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One way to resolve the issue</strong> was to rename ~/Documents/CODE into ~/Documents/Code, then in Organizer (select the Repositories Tab) I deleted the repository listing for MyProjectName.  NOTE - Only removes XCode's reference to the repository, the actual repository remains intact.  Now Close XCode and Reopen it.  Open the project MyProjectName.  XCode will recreate a reference to the Project with the correct Capitalization.  Note that the renaming of the directory seems to force XCode to recognize the new directory name when the repository is recreated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another way to resolve the issue is:</strong> within XCode's Organizer window (select the Repositories Tab), delete the reference to the repository.  Then, still in Organizer, select the \"Projects\" tab at top.  To the left of the project's window is a list of all the projects...select MyProjectName.  Now in the center frame is a field named \"Derived Data\" with a path to your project.  Click the little -> arrow to the right of the PATH to open up the Project's Internal Settings Directory in Finder.  Open the file called \"info.plist\" and edit the key \"WorkspacePath\" such that it's value EXACTLY MATCHES the location of your project (correct the capitalization of the directory if necessary).  Save, and return to Organizer.  Close XCode.  Reopen XCode and the repository reference will be recreated.  You can go directly into Organizer now, select the \"Repositories\" tab, then select MyProjectName's repository.  You'll see the commit messages there (even if you haven't committed yet, you'll still see the auto-generated 'first-commit' that occurred internally when your project was created).</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","githooks","pre-commit"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":122,"score":4,"question_id":7495819,"title":"How to test current commit and not the working tree?","body":"<p>I am trying to set up a pre-commit hook to test my project before any commit goes through, but I can't find how to make sure that only HEAD (with patches from the current commit) are tested and not the current working_tree (which in most cases is dirty for me).</p>\n\n<p>Solutions found:</p>\n\n<p>Found this link and ended up doing the following.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://newartisans.com/2009/02/building-a-better-pre-commit-hook-for-git/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://newartisans.com/2009/02/building-a-better-pre-commit-hook-for-git/</a></p>\n\n<pre><code># Checkout a copy of the current index into MIRROR\ngit checkout-index --prefix=$TMPDIR/ -af\n\n# Remove files from MIRROR which are no longer present in the index\ngit diff-index --cached --name-only --diff-filter=D -z HEAD | \\\n   (cd $TMPDIR &amp;&amp; xargs -0 rm -f --)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["git","continuous-integration","hudson","github","jenkins"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":9,"up_vote_count":28,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":10704,"score":28,"question_id":5212304,"title":"Authenticate Jenkins CI for Github private repository","body":"<p>I'd like for Jenkins to automagically fetch data from my private repository hosted on Github.\nBut I have no idea how to accomplish that task..

All of the tests can be run in parallel.  </p>\n\n<p>I've looked into using fork-plugin and parameterized-trigger-plugin, but it looks like they need to be statically configured.  Is there a way of dealing with this type of dynamic dependency diamond and having Jenkins merge integration into master only if everything succeeds?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["osx","git","osx-mountain-lion","gitolite"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":121,"score":0,"question_id":13058415,"title":"Stuck with Gitolite on OSX","body":"<p>I am in the process of installing the latest version of gitolite on an osx mountain lion server.

I have 2 development machines, one running Windows7, the other Mac OSX. They both are using Eclipse and EGit, and both have cloned the same project from a remote repo. That's where the similarities end, because my windows machine has a nasty habit of retaining a file mode of <strong>644</strong> (r-xr--r--) on its local repo, while the mode on the Mac defaults to a cool <strong>775</strong> (rwxrwxr--x).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem's obviously the file permissions - GIT reports there are files that have changed due to differences in file modes and not actual content. The solution seemed obvious, run the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code> git config core.filemode false\n git config --global core.filemode false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...which worked like a charm, <em>except</em> when committing and merging resolved <em>conflicts</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say files A, B and C exist on both the Windows and Mac repos. Next, let's change the file mode for these 3 files on the Mac machine so that the developer can edit them. Now change some of the contents in file A. Because we're ignoring the file modes (thanks to the commands above) only file A will be committed and pushed, ready for the Windows machine to fetch, merge and enjoy...</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's edit file A again on the Mac <em>and</em> on the Windows machines, effectively causing a potential conflict, and let the Windows machine commit and push file A first. Then, when the Mac user commits their changes to file A and fetches the latest changes from the remote repo, a conflict is obviously created.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving the conflict on the Mac machine and adding file A back to their local repo, committing that merge includes the previously ignored files B and C, and thus highlighting my problem! Why are the previously ignored files being included in this merge commit? This doesn't seem to be a Mac / Windows problem exclusively, as this problem can be recreated both ways...</p>\n\n<p>This probably wouldn't matter if there were only 3 files, but this project I'm referring to includes thousands, and all these up and down push and pulls are insane. Am I missing something really obvious? Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["git","branch"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":910,"score":1,"question_id":4826779,"title":"Git Switching branch","body":"<p>There is somthing I don't get yet with git.
