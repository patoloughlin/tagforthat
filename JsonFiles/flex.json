For example:\nIf i take a previously saved document and zip it, then i open it on an other computer. and i do the check, then it returns false while it has definitly bee saved before (on another computer).</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: what are the criteria for a document to be labeled \"saved\"?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":969,"score":1,"question_id":7250671,"title":"tlf text field align right problem","body":"<p>i have a tlf text field created with action script.\nwhen i add a </p>\n\n<pre><code>format.align = TextFormatAlign.RIGHT;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the area of tlftextfield that not have text not get selected, you have to click on the text to get foucs.</p>\n\n<p>example link: <a href=\"http://aradon.co.il/test/tlf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://aradon.co.il/test/tlf.html</a></p>\n\n<p>here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   import fl.text.TLFTextField;\n   import flash.text.TextFormat;\n   import flash.text.TextFormatAlign;\n\n   var format:TextFormat = new TextFormat(\"Tahoma\", 13, 0x0);\n   format.align = TextFormatAlign.RIGHT;\n\n   var _valueField:TLFTextField = new TLFTextField();\n   _valueField.width = 200;\n   _valueField.height = 22;\n\n   _valueField.x = 20;\n   _valueField.y = 20;\n   _valueField.wordWrap = true;\n   _valueField.multiline = false;\n   _valueField.type = TextFieldType.INPUT;\n   _valueField.defaultTextFormat = format;\n\n   _valueField.background = true;\n   _valueField.backgroundColor = 0xc6c6c6;\n\n   _valueField.setTextFormat( format );\n\n   addChild(_valueField);\n\n\n   _valueField.text = \"text\";\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html","flash","flex","flex3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13265005,"title":"Reading The Browser URL in AS3?","body":"<p>My application is integrated with the Other application as a Tab in the IFrame of Parent Application.</p>\n\n<p>I want To read the Browser Address Bar URL.</p>\n\n<p>Is it Possible to read.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe id=\"myIFrameID123\" src=\"http://192.168.1.102:8080/om/om.html?ucode=\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And trying to Access the Parent app URL</p>\n\n<pre><code>var search:String = ExternalInterface.call(\"window.location.search.toString\");\nvar vars:URLVariables = new URLVariables(search);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If its possible to Read the address Bar URL ll be Fine...\nBoth app running in Different JBOS.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","flex4.5"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1669,"score":1,"question_id":6029866,"title":"flex 4 mobile problem with ViewNavigatorApplication states and firstView","body":"<p>I'm having a crack at making my first Flex mobile application (although I'm not new to Flex), and I've tripped at the first hurdle. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot get <b>ViewNavigatorApplication</b> to display a view when trying to use <b>firstView</b> with states e.g. <b>firstView.phone</b>, <b>firstView.tablet</b>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just left with a blank action bar and content area. </p>\n\n<p>If I try setting setting <b>firstView</b> with no state (e.g. <b>firstView=\"view.HomeView\"</b>) the view loads fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:ViewNavigatorApplication\n    xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\" \n    xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n    firstView.phone=\"views.HomeView\"\n    firstView.tablet=\"views.TabletHomeView\"\n    applicationDPI=\"160\" \n    creationComplete=\"initApplication()\"&gt;\n    &lt;s:states&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"portraitPhone\" stateGroups=\"portrait, phone\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"landscapePhone\" stateGroups=\"landscape, phone\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"portraitTablet\" stateGroups=\"portrait, tablet\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"landscapeTablet\" stateGroups=\"landscape, tablet\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/s:states&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Style source=\"assets/css/application.css\"/&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n            import mx.events.ResizeEvent;\n\n            private var isPortrait:Boolean;\n            private var isTablet:Boolean;\n\n            private function initApplication():void\n            {               \n                addEventListener(ResizeEvent.RESIZE, resizeHandler);\n                addEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, resizeHandler);\n            }\n\n            private function resizeHandler(event:*):void\n            {\n                isPortrait = (stage.height &gt; stage.width);\n                isTablet = (stage.height &gt; 950 || stage.width &gt; 950);\n\n                currentState = (isPortrait ?

In a list when I did the same thing, I could access the property using listData property of item renderer, but in case of datagrid I couldn't do so.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flex4","emgucv","face-recognition"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":37,"score":0,"question_id":13227715,"title":"face detection in flex","body":"<p>I'm trying to write a simple program that will detect a face off a webcam and then trigger an event(optionally take a snapshot of the face)</p>\n\n<p>I don't need anything fancy like to compare it to other faces I just need to send out an email that someone is at the door (hopefully with attached photo)</p>\n\n<p>the problem is im very confused about how and what to use</p>\n\n<p>I see there is a very powerful \"opencv\" that has a few wrapper classes namely opencv.net and emgu.cv</p>\n\n<p>I've seen a few examples here and there but i have yet to find a working set of source code that works with flex 4</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone recommend what the best course of action for a amateur programmer like me.</p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","colors","styles","textarea","spark"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":16,"score":0,"question_id":13234688,"title":"Spark TextArea - Change part of text color","body":"<p>How can I change part of my text color in <code>spark.components.TextArea</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","maven","flexmojos","flex-mojos"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":0,"question_id":11616872,"title":"S:Application could not resolved to type","body":"<p>Hi am new to Flex and working on integration of Flex with Flexmojos (Maven plugin), i tried integrating but i had been facing a problem during compile in Main.mxml as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>s:Application could not be resolved to type</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Am using Flex SDK 4.6, i read few solutions specifying to check namespace and check my SDK version, everything is fine.

It describes the differences between Animate and AnimateFilter. AnimateFilter is transient. It applies the filter and when it's done it removes it. Animate applies the values to the target permanently.</p>\n\n<p>We also should be aware that in Flex 4 not all effects support triggers.  </p>\n\n<p>From the AnimateInstance class: </p>\n\n<pre><code>override public function startEffect():void\n{  \n    // This override removes EffectManager.effectStarted() to avoid use of\n    // mx_internal. New effects are not currently triggerable, so\n    // this should not matter\n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this means is that we cannot rely on rollOverEffect to trigger the effect bound to it. We must call effect.play() on the rollOver event. </p>\n\n<p>So that means when we use the Animate class we also need to change this:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOverEffect=\"{glowImage}\" rollOutEffect=\"{unglowImage}\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to this:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOver=\"glowImage.play()\" rollOut=\"unglowImage.play()\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note when using <strong>multiple related effects</strong> it is best practice to call end() on a playing effect before calling play() on it's related effect. </p>\n\n<p>Also, note when using a <strong>single effect</strong>, as in the answer, reverse it rather than end it like so glowAnimation.play(null, true). </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOver=\"rollOverAnimation.play()\" rollOut=\"rollOverAnimation.play(null, true)\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","module","flex4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":112,"score":0,"question_id":11807055,"title":"Error: Could not resolve to a component implementation","body":"<p>I have a module that seems to work fine with spark components in it but when I try to load my own it gives me this error. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: Could not resolve &lt;views:DisplayList&gt; to a component implementation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;s:Module xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\" \n          xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n          xmlns:mx=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx\" \n          xmlns:views=\"views.*\"\n\n          width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \n\n          &gt;\n\n    &lt;views:DisplayList width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"/&gt;\n&lt;/s:Module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript","bar-chart"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3777,"score":0,"question_id":1442719,"title":"Flex 3 Set Maximum and minimum X Axis value in bar chart","body":"<p>I want to set Maximum and minimum value for X axis in bar chart in flex action script 3 file.</p>\n\n<p>Following line in working in MXML file but I want these code in actionscript 3.\n\n \t</p>\n\n<p>    \t\t\t\n    \n\n</p>\n\n<p>can anybody change this into Actionscript 3.</p>\n\n<p>thanks..</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":27,"score":1,"question_id":13220509,"title":"The application has stopped unexpectedly: How to Debug for flash builder","body":"<p>I need to use the mobile debug mode but every time I run the debug mode.

So, my questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Has anyone else run into this issue?  If so, how did you handle\nit?</li>\n<li>If you have developed a workaround, does your solution depend on\na specific SDK version, or does it work for all SDK versions?</li>\n<li>Was the change in behavior from 4.1 to 4.5 intentional, or is\nthis a bug?  I suspect bug, but I've been unable to find anything\ndefinitive one way or the other.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note that my example above is contrived to demonstrate the problem with the least amount of code and minimal complexity.  In my actual project, I have a module that contains a <code>TitleWindow</code> with subcomponents, and I'm trying to have the subcomponents call methods in the <code>TitleWindow</code> (via <code>parentDocument</code>).  So, workarounds that involve other ways of finding the <code>Application</code> object aren't really applicable because the subcomponents are actually looking for a <code>TitleWindow</code>, not the <code>Application</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":13121271,"title":"Flex: disable hand cursor when mouse is over toggle button bar","body":"<p>How can I disable the use of hand cursor when over a toggle button bar?

If I remove that VGroup (and all it's children), the transition plays fine.  Add it back in, and everything blows up again.  I tried using a VBox instead of a VGroup, but there was no change--same error.  I also tried getting rid of horizontalAlign=\"center\", and again, no change.</p>\n\n<p>Some further experimenting reveals that if I only have one child in the VGroup, then the transition works.  As soon as I get two children in the VGroup, however, it throws the error.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if I remove the VGroup completely and simply make the Labels direct children of the GridItem, it fails (same Invalid BitmapData error).  So it seems that perhaps the real culprit is having multiple controls at the same level in the control tree?  E.g., two controls work if they are in a linear parent-child relationship inside the GridItem (GridItem->VGroup->Label), but two labels at the same level (whether their immediate parent is the VGroup or the GridItem) causes the Invalid BitmapData error.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any other control I could use to accomplish what I'm trying to do with the Grid control, which is layout things in a table, with some cells that span into other rows or columns.  TileLayout would work if I didn't need to span into other rows and columns in a few cases.</p>\n\n<p>I've thought about using absolute positioning, but that will make it difficult (impossible?) to easily add/remove other controls into the \"grid,\" which is what I want to do.  When we're running subscription promotionals, we'll add text into certain cells noting how the promotional affects (or does not affect) that particular pricing option.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Here's what the grid looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:Grid id='membershipGrid' &gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"One Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Two Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"5 Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;!-- Comment out this VGroup, and everything works fine --&gt;\n           &lt;s:VGroup horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Monthly Autorenew\"  fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Payment plan option is not available\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"for multiple year memberhips.\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n           &lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Standard Membership\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardOneYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_ONE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardTwoYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_TWO_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardFiveYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_FIVE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"monthlyAutorenew\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.MONTHLY_AUTORENEW).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"tags":["html","flex","variables"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13019552,"title":"Possible to get html form field values sent to Flex 3 app even once they're changed?","body":"<p>I have a project where a user will go to username.website.com.</p>\n\n<p>Once the page loads, there will be an HTML form that displays whatever information we have on the user in an HTML form.

But that would involve calling event.stopProp() type of calls correct not merely and at capture time rather than bubble time? Also, I heard that typing the event helps save CPU, so event:Event is slower than event:MouseEvent. I can try and find sources but until then maybe someone knows what I'm talking about.

Below is a code snippet:</p>\n\n<p>Datagrid</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:GridColumn dataField=\"datf\" headerText=\"Period From\" rendererIsEditable=\"true\"&gt;\n&lt;s:itemRenderer&gt;\n  &lt;fx:Component&gt;\n       &lt;s:GridItemRenderer dataChange=\"updateRenderer()\"&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n                 &lt;![CDATA[\n                           public function updateRenderer():void {\n                                periodFrom.text = outerDocument.dtf1.format(data.datf);\n                           }\n\n                           private function dateField_labelFunc(item:Date):String {\n                                return outerDocument.dtf1.format(item);\n                           }\n                 ]]&gt;\n            &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n                 &lt;mx:DateField horizontalCenter=\"0\" verticalCenter=\"0\" width=\"90%\" id=\"periodFrom\" labelFunction=\"dateField_labelFunc\"/&gt;\n       &lt;/s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n  &lt;/fx:Component&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Handler</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function createBillResult_resultHandler(event:ResultEvent):void\n        {\n            var dataProvider = itemsDg.dataProvider;\n            var item = null;\n\n            for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; dataProvider.length; i++){\n                item = dataProvider.getItemAt(i);\n                trace(item.datf);&lt;!--WHAT SHOULD GO HERE--&gt;\n                billItems.lnid = item.lnid;\n                billItems.days = item.days;\n                billItems.ratu = item.ratu;\n                createBillItemsResult.token = billingService.createBillItems(billItems);\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would have thought that I can access the value from the itemrenderer using the dataField property like I do with the other items although these are not itemrenderers, but trace(item.datf) just returns 'undefined'.

We package that ANE for several platforms, including Mac OS and iOS. On the Mac, all is well when we build using the legacy standard C++ library (<code>libstdc++</code>). Of course we  don't want to stay with an obsolete soon-to-be unsupported library and we switched to the current <code>libc++</code>. The library  (.a file) builds fine that way, and so do the native iOS applications that call on that library.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <code>adt</code> Adobe tool that builds ANEs now fail with no useful error message (don't start me on Adobe tools quality). Some trickery with Unix processes let us find out that <code>adt</code> calls the OS linker <code>ld</code>. Replicating the same <code>ld</code> invocation let us find out that the linker complains about a boatload of undefined symbols, all (or perhaps most) being standard C++ library symbols.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed that <code>ld</code> invocation uses as a parameter <code>-lstdc++</code> which refers to the legacy library. I suppose that using libc++ would imply the <code>lc++</code> argument. However, trying such a modified <code>ld</code> failed due to (apparently) unrelated directory issues.</p>\n\n<p>So is there a way to tell <code>adt</code> that our .a library uses the current standard C++ library and not the legacy one?

For example, I want to have a sequence of images fading in at specific times relative to audio being played.  This sequence can be accomplished easily with Adobe Flash Professional, resulting in a SWF, but I want to create Flex-based code that allows for data-driven timing and image source identification.  The technique of setting the playheadTime on the <code>Effect</code> seemed to get me what I wanted.  I can stream audio (which broadcasts time events) perfectly in synch with the animation.  I can also allows the user to seek/scrub the \"timeline\" (via a <code>Slider</code>) and the animation behaves as if it has a true timeline based on key frames.  The technique works <em>almost</em>, so I hope there is a simple solution to my problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","flex","audio","playback","game"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":57,"score":-1,"question_id":12845829,"title":"In IOS - playing audio files with various speed and rate - need advise","body":"<p>I am writing a simple app which allows the user to attach a very short (1-2 sec) sound file to pictures ( it is for teaching kids the sounds that animals make ).</p>\n\n<p>The kid will scroll thru the pictures and when the new picture emerges on the screen - the sound should be played.</p>\n\n<p>What I am looking for an advise on is how to make the sounds play faster accordingly to speed the kid scrolls.

doing up until now, is share the catalogFacadeTarget bean with Flex, and with the controllers from the jstl setup. So I can call the same methods I call from flex, now from the controllers with the model and view methods. I thought that this way I would not encounter any problems. Here is my dispatcher-servlet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- URL mapping --&gt;\n&lt;bean id=\"urlMap\"\n    class=\"org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"urlMap\"&gt;\n        &lt;props&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/welcome.htm\"&gt;welcome&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/welcome\"&gt;welcome&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/catalog.htm\"&gt;catalog&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/catalog\"&gt;catalog&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;/props&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- Controllers --&gt;\n&lt;bean name=\"welcome\"\n    class=\"com.bamboo.catW3.business.impl.Welcome\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"successView\"&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;welcome&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n     &lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"catalogFacadeTarget\"/&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n&lt;bean name=\"catalog\"\n        class=\"com.bamboo.catW3.business.impl.Catalog\"&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"successView\"&gt;\n            &lt;value&gt;catalog&lt;/value&gt;\n        &lt;/property&gt;\n         &lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"catalogFacadeTarget\"/&gt;\n &lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>&lt;bean id=\"viewResolver\" class=\"org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver\"&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"viewClass\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"prefix\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;/WEB-INF/jsp/&lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"suffix\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;.jsp&lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now this was working fine, even though my intellij ide highlights catalogFacadeTarget reference and says that I can't resolve the bean, which would be great: if anyone knows how to make him understand, or maybe make me understand:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"*catalogFacadeTarget*\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This was working fine for simple objects that do not have complicate relationships, for example I have a table USER that does not relate to anyone, and I can do this from the model and view method on the jstl controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List users = catalogFacadeImpl.getUserList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No problem, I get the list of users and print it. However if I try to make this on a more complicated object, that has relationships with itself and stuff, like with the Object CATEGORY:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List categories = catalogFacadeImpl.getCategoryList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the exceptcion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Request processing failed; nested exception is org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: com.bamboo.catW3.domain.Category.categories, no session or session was closed\norg.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:488)\norg.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.doGet(FrameworkServlet.java:431)\njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:690)\njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:803)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would usually be a problem with the hbm and the way relationships are configured, however, this can't be the case, because from flex I call this very same method and have no trouble. So what I guess is that I'm not sharing the bean as I though i was. Not that would not give me this error either.</p>\n\n<p>I'm really confused now, any suggestion on where to look would be deeply appreciated. Thank you very much, tried to post the hbm just in case it helps somehow, but was to long for this post.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","adobe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":485,"score":4,"question_id":3412244,"title":"Flex Text to Speech Program","body":"<p>I am developing a Adobe Flex Application which speeches some given text inside a text box.\nHere am supposed to use an inbuilt function or something else, because I dont want to give an outside link to convert the text to speech since Internet connection will not be available.\nSample program written in Air are also applicable\nCan any one post some sample code or link?\nThanks in Advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","matrix","line","shape"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":61,"score":0,"question_id":12828640,"title":"Drawing shapes in Actionscript","body":"<p>So I need to draw some custom shapes in Actionscript on canvas dynamically(like some spinning wheel made of lines and circles).

Does anyone have anything in mind that may be causing this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flash-builder"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":12733810,"title":"Actionscript airxmail embed base 64 encoded image","body":"<p>I'm developing in Flash builder 4.6 and I am capturing a signature which gives me a base64 encoded image, I use airxmail to send a mail to clients etc.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an example of how to embed the base64 encoded image into the body of an email?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","preventdefault"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":1,"question_id":12716874,"title":"Flex: preventDefault on spark:ListBase not working","body":"<p>The proposed UX I am trying to achieve is this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>user clicks menu item (via a listBase subclass: e.g. ButtonBar or TabBar)</li>\n<li>prevent initial selection</li>\n<li>validate if user needs to address issues (e.g. unsaved data on a form, etc.)</li>\n<li>if valid, take selection and set the listBase to that selectedIndex, otherwise present warnings to user and cancel out the selection process altogether</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This does not work as you'd expect.

An HTTPStatusEvent object does not necessarily indicate an error condition; it simply reflects the HTTP status code (if any) that is provided by the networking stack. Some Flash Player environments may be unable to detect HTTP status codes; a status code of 0 is always reported in these cases. Just wanted to add additional findings...through testing we were able to use that same certificate on another server - and despite security warnings, I was able to get data on my test Android device. This makes me think that the issue may be related to the server....It's hosted by Rackspace so we're going to reach out to them to attempt more troubleshooting.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","sqlite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12602666,"title":"Flex: Accessing SQLite entry using 'getItemAt()'","body":"<p>I have an array populated with input from an <code>SQLite</code> database.

As far as I'm aware this is not part of the standard flex popup. It then has a question mark image in the top left corner of the main window. I believe this is the stand in graphic that flex uses when it tried to load an image but can't. At the bottom of the popup is a text input box which is pre-filled with an IP address. The address is the same for both myself and the tester. Finally at the very bottom is an OK and a Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The buttons are styled because I set a global button skin for my app. Other than that I did not create this popup and cannot find any evidence of it in my scripts.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately fired up the same build that I have on my own iPad.

This works fine for URLs with no special characters (by either setting the <code>source</code> property or calling <code>load()</code> on <code>Image</code>). However, when a URL is submitted that has special characters which have already been escaped, i.e. in most cases simply copied directly from the URL bar in a browser, <code>URLRequest</code> escapes the percent signs again with '%25', which makes the URL invalid and the server returns an error. Pasting the same URL in a browser loads the image just fine though. I've tried <code>decodeURI()</code> on the URL, but that ignores a large set of characters, so I tried <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>, and that decodes everything correctly, but when <code>URLRequest</code> goes to re-encode it, it ignores the now-decoded special characters and doesn't escape them, so in this case the URL is not valid, because it still has unsafe characters in it and fails. So, how can I send <code>URLRequest</code> something with special characters in it (encoded or unencoded) and have it actually work? Really, I wish it didn't do anything with my URL and let me determine if it's valid or not, but it's embedded in the Flash Player globals swc and is therefore the closed-source piece of flash and I can't see the source code.

events for Flex objects","body":"<p>[Edit]\nThe main question here loosely translates as 'is Flex multi-threaded'? I have since found out that it is not, so I won't have data mysteriously changing half way through an operation. The code below worked, but made things awkward and confusing. I eventually fixed the problem with an architecture change, eliminating the need to suppress events. As the first commenter suggested.</p>\n\n<p>Infinite loops were eliminated by changing the way events were listened to and performing certain actions explicitly rather than via events.</p>\n\n<p>Collating events was made easier using a command pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, do not use the code below if you come across this page!\n[/Edit]</p>\n\n<p>I'm building some Flex applications using a simple, lightweight MVC pattern. Models extend or encapsulate a dispatcher and fire events when updated. I'm stuck with Flex 3.5.</p>\n\n<p>In some situations, I'll want to suppress these events to avoid infinite loops or help collate multiple actions into a single event. </p>\n\n<p>My first stab at a solution that doesn't litter the models with unnecessary and confusing code is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private var _suppressEvents:Boolean = false;\n    public function suppressEvents(callback:Function):void\n    {\n        // In case of error, ensure the suppression is turned off, then re-throw\n        var err:Error = null;\n        _suppressEvents = true;\n        try \n        {\n            callback();\n        }\n        catch(e:Error)\n        {\n            err = e;\n        }\n        _suppressEvents = false;\n        if (err)\n        {\n            throw (err);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function dispatch(type:String, data:*):void\n    {\n        // Suppress if called from a suppress callback.\n        if (!_suppressEvents)\n        {\n\n            _dispatcher.dispatchEvent(new DataEvent(type, data));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously I call 'suppressEvents' with a function containing the model code I wish to run.</p>\n\n<p>My questions:</p>\n\n<p>1: Is there a chance I could accidentally lose events using this technique?</p>\n\n<p>2: Do I need to think about any other error edge cases when it comes to ensuring I don't accidentally end up in a suppressed state after a call?</p>\n\n<p>3: Is there a cleaner way I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","xml-parsing","flex3"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":1,"question_id":12530159,"title":"Flex3 can't access value of XML with brackets","body":"<p>I have the following XML object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ns2:errorCode&gt;\n  3001\n&lt;/ns2:errorCode&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I access the value if I only have a string saying errorCode.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to do something like:</p>\n\n<p><code>xml['*::'+str]</code> \nwhere <code>xml</code> is the XML object with the above node and <code>str</code> is my string variable containing <code>\"errorCode\"</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flex3","flex2"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":41,"score":0,"question_id":12582399,"title":"Creating vertical scrollbar","body":"<p>I want to create a vertical scrollbar in such a way that we can do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Change the color of the arrow icons of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the background color of the arrow icons of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the TrackColor of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the ThumbColor of the scrollbar.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flex3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":46,"score":0,"question_id":12554433,"title":"How to prevent the flickering associated with addChild in flex?","body":"<p>I have the following application where I'm loading the labels dynamically at run-time and I need them to update every X seconds (3 here in the example).

Without actually having looked at the SDKs, my understanding would have been that AIR enables you to develop Flash (i.e. ActionScript, and apparently also JavaScript/HTML) applications that can be run by the AIR runtime without the need of a browser (such as a pure desktop or smartphone application). The Flex SDK appears to be a collection of classes and additional APIs (similar to JavaFX?) to extend the \"standard\" Flash library.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I've downloaded the most recent versions of both SDKs, and apparently, it's not that simple. So, first I looked at the AIR SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html</a>, v3.4 as of now). As far as I can tell, the \"adt\" utility is the main part of AIR that lets you package finished applications. However, I'm not sure if the AIR SDK actually includes a compiler – say you have a bunch of ActionScript .as files and want to turn them into a .swf or .air file using the AIR SDK, is that even possible?</p>\n\n<p>The Flex SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html</a>, v4.6 as of now) unfortunately didn't help with the confusion. It does include compilers and other tools, but in its \"bin\" folder, I could also find \"adt\" and \"adl\" – the AIR tools! What's more, it also has \"AIR SDK license.pdf\" and \"AIR SDK readme.txt\" files; judging from those, it appears that the Flex SDK includes some older version of the AIR SDK version 2.</p>\n\n<p>To make things even more confusing, I also found a \"combined version of the Flex and AIR® SDKs (Flex SDK 4.6.0.23201 and AIR 3.4.0.2540 SDK)\" on Adobe's site (<a href=\"http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/</a>). It seems that this wasn't merely created by copying the AIR 3.4 files to the Flex 4.6 files, adding yet another item to the list.</p>\n\n<p>So, essentially, I'd like to know the differences between these two (three?)

Therefore, the same itemClick event is dispatched when the user clicks the main button or selects the current item from the pop-up menu.

First click event will be dispatched followed by itemClick event. In the Click event handler we are writing code to open the popup so it is opening the popup and in the itemclick event handler respective page navigation code is there so it is navigating to that particular page. (These two are happening one by one so first popup is opening and within seconds it is navigating to the recently opened page because of itemclick handler code. So whenever we are clicking on main button these two actions are happening parallel hence we are getting a popup blink but not stable popup. If we modify anything in itemclick handler it is effecting the functionality of popup button because same handler for both the button clicks. Even the event target is also same in case of itemclick event irrespective of main button or popup button.)</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","flash","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":462,"score":0,"question_id":3349158,"title":"Converting a flex component w/images to bitmap","body":"<p>I am trying to take images I am placing in a flex canvas component to a bitmap.

If you double click on other products the same happens.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have made a context menue for the datagrid. In the context menue you can select \"open product in new window\". If you click that a second instance of the program will be started. And it opens the product in a new tab automatically. Now if I do that again in the first window (app instance 1) it should not open a new window. Instead it should open a new FlexTab in the app instance 2 (second window). And if search for products and use the context menue to open a product in a new window, that will only open a new FlexTab in the app instance 1 (Window 1).</p>\n\n<p>To open the new window I used navigateToUrl(baseurl + fragments, window_name). \nI heard, that you can use the window_name to open the same window (no new window). </p>\n\n<p>E.g.

With some server-side logging as well as some logging hacked into the swf, I know that the UrlLoader is successfully doing and GET'ing a crossdomain.xml file, is correctly processing it (ie: if I wreck it, I get a security error), and is also successfully completing the \"load\" request (the server sends the data).

What seems to have been happening was that the Event.COMPLETE event handler (onComplete in the stack trace) was using the global SP object.

Any pointers, documentation, etc. that anyone can give will be gratefully appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I decided not to include services-config.xml, remoting-config.xml, etc. files in this question since they are large and contain more than is relevant here, but I can supply them on request.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>After reviewing the code I released I'd made an error in this question. The login RPC method is used for unsecure login attempts, whilst logging in via a mx.messaging.ChannelSet is used for secure login. I've updated the question to reflect this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The error returned is an <code>mx.rpc.events.FaultEvent</code> which has the fields:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Fault String: Send failed\nFault Code: Client.Error.MessageSend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The logon function (Flex side) is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public function login(username:String, password:String, loginFunction:Function = null, failureFunction:Function = null):void {\n    if (_usingSecuredConnection) {\n        this.loginSuccessFunction = loginFunction;\n        this.loginFailureFunction = failureFunction;\n\n        // Make sure that the user is not already logged in.\n        if (_channelSet.authenticated == true) {\n            AlertUtil.alertError(\"You are already logged in!\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        token = _channelSet.login(username, password);\n        token.addResponder(new AsyncResponder(loginResultEvent, loginFaultEvent));\n    } else {\n        // Defer to API\n    SecurityAPI.login(username, password, [onLoginResultNonSecured, loginFunction], [onLoginFailure, failureFunction]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On an attempt to login securely, it always results in the function loginFaultEvent being invoked invoked with the FaultEvent as stated above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that this is now a crossdomain issue. Trying to access https from http is the problem. However I have put what I think is a VERY permissive crossdomain file in the ROOT webapp of my Tomcat server and it has not helped. Anyone know what I am doing wrong? Is it the wrong location for Tomcat7 or have I got a mistake in my crossdomain file? (note: 8443 is my secure port)</p>\n\n<p><strong>crossdomain.xml :</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM \"http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;\n    &lt;site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies=\"all\" /&gt;\n    &lt;allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\" to-ports=\"8443\"/&gt;\n    &lt;allow-http-request-headers-from domain=\"localhost\" headers=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Update 4</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now overcome this issue: It was a crossdomain problem and was fixed by placing a cross-domain file in the ROOT webapp directory of my tomcat server. The content of that cross-domain file is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM \"http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;\n  &lt;allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My flex application now communicates HTTP and HTTPS fine using IE9 and Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>However it still doesn't work on Firefox.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Phil</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex","actionscript"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":12389821,"title":"Camera crashs after multibel use of .setMode();","body":"<p>I'm developing a video chat application using flex. \nAfter some bandwidth check I want to resize the camera resolution based an the result of it. </p>\n\n<p>But every second time I do that the camera frame freezes and I have to kill the flash player and reastart it.

Now I'm writing some new code to retrieve data from the server, but the server has to first process this data and this takes some time (say 5 to 30 minutes depending on the request). </p>\n\n<p>My design pattern up to now has been to show the user a busy cursor and disable the main application (Flex by default blurs out the application when it's disabled). This generally lasts a second or two while the communication completes. However, now the communication takes a long time to complete, and I'd like to be able to have the user continue to use the application even though the process from the server hasn't returned yet. </p>\n\n<p>So what I'd like to do is NOT disable the main application so the user can interact with it while he/she waits for the data to return. The problem I worry about is if the user uses the application to send another process to the server during this time (e.g. before the first process comes back) -- will this cause problems? That is, is BlazeDS smart enough to know the channel is busy and therefore will queue the requests automagically? For example, will BlazeDS wait until the first request comes back before sending the second, or third, etc?</p>\n\n<p>Or do I have to manually control this communication somehow to ensure it occurs in a serial fashion? If so, are there any design patterns to handle this?</p>\n\n<p>Or, can BlazeDS send and get back a second request before the first one returns?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice much appreciated. I'm looking for ways to avoid having the user stare at a unusable application for 5 to 30 minutes waiting for data to return. A busy cursor is fine, because it shows the data has not returned yet, but a disabled main application particularly (whether it's blurred or not) is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>Here I'm talking about simultaneous calls to different methods, rather than the same method. So if I have two methods, I'd like to call the first method, and while it is waiting to come back, call a second or third method, which return safely before (finally) the first method returns.

If result is null is their anyway to figure out why it is null, meaning checking if the WSDL is available or not, and if it is a valid request?</p>\n\n<p>I am running a Net Monitor in the app to make sure it is online.</p>\n\n<p>My code is as follows for the login process</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;s:View xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n        xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\"\n        xmlns:pingdomapi=\"services.pingdomapi.*\"\n        title=\"Login\"&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n            import valueObjects.Auth_CredentialsData;\n\n\n            protected function login(event:MouseEvent):void\n            {\n                var credentials:Auth_CredentialsData = new Auth_CredentialsData;\n                credentials.username = txt_username.text;\n                credentials.password = txt_password.text;\n                Auth_loginResult.token = pingdomAPI.Auth_login('****',credentials);\n                trace(Auth_loginResult.token.result);\n            }\n        ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;\n        &lt;s:CallResponder id=\"Auth_loginResult\"/&gt;\n        &lt;pingdomapi:PingdomAPI id=\"pingdomAPI\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;\n    &lt;s:Label x=\"10\" y=\"10\" text=\"Username\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:TextInput id=\"txt_username\" x=\"10\" y=\"41\" text=\"david.long@cagedata.com\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:Label x=\"10\" y=\"104\" text=\"Password\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:TextInput id=\"txt_password\" x=\"10\" y=\"135\" displayAsPassword=\"true\" text=\"Simpsons#1\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:Button id=\"btn_login\" y=\"198\" right=\"30\" label=\"Login\" click=\"login(event)\"/&gt;\n&lt;/s:View&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":336,"score":2,"question_id":6192347,"title":"FLEX XMLDecoder WTF!","body":"<p>Could someone explain why the FLEX 4.5 XMLDecoder does this to my XML-data?</p>\n\n<pre><code>var decoder:XMLDecoder = new XMLDecoder;\nvar $object:Object = decoder.decode( &lt;xmltag&gt;08.00&lt;/xmltag&gt; );\n// object = \"08.00\"\n\nvar decoder:XMLDecoder = new XMLDecoder;\nvar $object:Object = decoder.decode( &lt;xmltag&gt;11.00&lt;/xmltag&gt; );\n// Object = \"11\" (HEY!

On Flex 3, when you set your application layout as absolute, the X and Y properties automatically lose their utility since every component of your layout will be determined automatically by default in the top left of your screen. It works similarly as the mobile layouts: You either use Canvas to set X and Y (most used by mobile game developers) or you let the device to place everything so it will avoid screen size problems and such.</p>\n\n<p>Is it still possible on Flex 4?

The thing is that in Flex 3 I could place 1 VBox, for instance, and 3 HBox inside it that each HBox would assume a position automatically one under the other, that is with X and Y properties blank. With Flex 4, when I place 1 VGroup and 3 HGroup inside without setting any X and Y propert, they'll just fill up one above the other, like if I had set X,Y = 0 to all of them. They don't assume position one under the other like it used to.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","dynamic-data","cdata","httpservice","htmltext"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":106,"score":0,"question_id":12315632,"title":"flex 4.6 parsing htmlText object with CDATA only last object displaying","body":"<p>I am trying to update multiple <code>&lt;mx:text&gt;</code> objects with a <code>htmlText</code> string.
