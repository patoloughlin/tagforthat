That means each card should have a place to store information about what file to show as its front face, and what file to show as its back face.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, create two variables in the Card component to store the file names. You might call these variables frontFile and backFile.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's think about the methods we need for our Card.\nTake another look at the application file. Notice that the app assumes it can make calls to functions named</p>\n\n<pre><code>makeCard(), passing it Strings to specify the suit and the value for this card\nturnUp()\nturnOver()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That means you'll need to define public functions for each of these calls. While you're at it, go ahead and define a function named turnDown as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the function makeCard, use the suit and value inputs to construct the filename to use for this card's front face. Set the frontFile property to this filename. You might also want to set the backFile, which is the same for all the cards.</p>\n\n<p>In the function turnUp, just set the card's source property to whatever String is stored in its frontFile property.</p>\n\n<p>In the function turnDown, set the card's source property to whatever String is stored in its backFile property.</p>\n\n<p>In turnOver, you'll want to check to see which file is showing, and change the source to show the other side of the card.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":0,"question_id":13294989,"title":"A star path finding without grid","body":"<p>Does any one knows any <a href=\"http://www.heyes-jones.com/astar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">A*</a> implementations, where the nodes are not grid?

For example:\nIf i take a previously saved document and zip it, then i open it on an other computer. and i do the check, then it returns false while it has definitly bee saved before (on another computer).</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: what are the criteria for a document to be labeled \"saved\"?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":970,"score":1,"question_id":7250671,"title":"tlf text field align right problem","body":"<p>i have a tlf text field created with action script.\nwhen i add a </p>\n\n<pre><code>format.align = TextFormatAlign.RIGHT;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the area of tlftextfield that not have text not get selected, you have to click on the text to get foucs.</p>\n\n<p>example link: <a href=\"http://aradon.co.il/test/tlf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://aradon.co.il/test/tlf.html</a></p>\n\n<p>here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   import fl.text.TLFTextField;\n   import flash.text.TextFormat;\n   import flash.text.TextFormatAlign;\n\n   var format:TextFormat = new TextFormat(\"Tahoma\", 13, 0x0);\n   format.align = TextFormatAlign.RIGHT;\n\n   var _valueField:TLFTextField = new TLFTextField();\n   _valueField.width = 200;\n   _valueField.height = 22;\n\n   _valueField.x = 20;\n   _valueField.y = 20;\n   _valueField.wordWrap = true;\n   _valueField.multiline = false;\n   _valueField.type = TextFieldType.INPUT;\n   _valueField.defaultTextFormat = format;\n\n   _valueField.background = true;\n   _valueField.backgroundColor = 0xc6c6c6;\n\n   _valueField.setTextFormat( format );\n\n   addChild(_valueField);\n\n\n   _valueField.text = \"text\";\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","html","flash","flex","flex3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":1,"question_id":13265005,"title":"Reading The Browser URL in AS3?","body":"<p>My application is integrated with the Other application as a Tab in the IFrame of Parent Application.</p>\n\n<p>I want To read the Browser Address Bar URL.</p>\n\n<p>Is it Possible to read.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe id=\"myIFrameID123\" src=\"http://192.168.1.102:8080/om/om.html?ucode=\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And trying to Access the Parent app URL</p>\n\n<pre><code>var search:String = ExternalInterface.call(\"window.location.search.toString\");\nvar vars:URLVariables = new URLVariables(search);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If its possible to Read the address Bar URL ll be Fine...\nBoth app running in Different JBOS.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","flex4.5"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1670,"score":1,"question_id":6029866,"title":"flex 4 mobile problem with ViewNavigatorApplication states and firstView","body":"<p>I'm having a crack at making my first Flex mobile application (although I'm not new to Flex), and I've tripped at the first hurdle. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot get <b>ViewNavigatorApplication</b> to display a view when trying to use <b>firstView</b> with states e.g. <b>firstView.phone</b>, <b>firstView.tablet</b>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just left with a blank action bar and content area. </p>\n\n<p>If I try setting setting <b>firstView</b> with no state (e.g. <b>firstView=\"view.HomeView\"</b>) the view loads fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:ViewNavigatorApplication\n    xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\" \n    xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n    firstView.phone=\"views.HomeView\"\n    firstView.tablet=\"views.TabletHomeView\"\n    applicationDPI=\"160\" \n    creationComplete=\"initApplication()\"&gt;\n    &lt;s:states&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"portraitPhone\" stateGroups=\"portrait, phone\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"landscapePhone\" stateGroups=\"landscape, phone\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"portraitTablet\" stateGroups=\"portrait, tablet\"/&gt;\n        &lt;s:State name=\"landscapeTablet\" stateGroups=\"landscape, tablet\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/s:states&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Style source=\"assets/css/application.css\"/&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n            import mx.events.ResizeEvent;\n\n            private var isPortrait:Boolean;\n            private var isTablet:Boolean;\n\n            private function initApplication():void\n            {               \n                addEventListener(ResizeEvent.RESIZE, resizeHandler);\n                addEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, resizeHandler);\n            }\n\n            private function resizeHandler(event:*):void\n            {\n                isPortrait = (stage.height &gt; stage.width);\n                isTablet = (stage.height &gt; 950 || stage.width &gt; 950);\n\n                currentState = (isPortrait ?

It describes the differences between Animate and AnimateFilter. AnimateFilter is transient. It applies the filter and when it's done it removes it. Animate applies the values to the target permanently.</p>\n\n<p>We also should be aware that in Flex 4 not all effects support triggers.  </p>\n\n<p>From the AnimateInstance class: </p>\n\n<pre><code>override public function startEffect():void\n{  \n    // This override removes EffectManager.effectStarted() to avoid use of\n    // mx_internal. New effects are not currently triggerable, so\n    // this should not matter\n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this means is that we cannot rely on rollOverEffect to trigger the effect bound to it. We must call effect.play() on the rollOver event. </p>\n\n<p>So that means when we use the Animate class we also need to change this:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOverEffect=\"{glowImage}\" rollOutEffect=\"{unglowImage}\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to this:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOver=\"glowImage.play()\" rollOut=\"unglowImage.play()\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note when using <strong>multiple related effects</strong> it is best practice to call end() on a playing effect before calling play() on it's related effect. </p>\n\n<p>Also, note when using a <strong>single effect</strong>, as in the answer, reverse it rather than end it like so glowAnimation.play(null, true). </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Image rollOver=\"rollOverAnimation.play()\" rollOut=\"rollOverAnimation.play(null, true)\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","module","flex4"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":115,"score":0,"question_id":11807055,"title":"Error: Could not resolve to a component implementation","body":"<p>I have a module that seems to work fine with spark components in it but when I try to load my own it gives me this error. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Error: Could not resolve &lt;views:DisplayList&gt; to a component implementation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;s:Module xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\" \n          xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n          xmlns:mx=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx\" \n          xmlns:views=\"views.*\"\n\n          width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \n\n          &gt;\n\n    &lt;views:DisplayList width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"/&gt;\n&lt;/s:Module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript","bar-chart"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":3779,"score":0,"question_id":1442719,"title":"Flex 3 Set Maximum and minimum X Axis value in bar chart","body":"<p>I want to set Maximum and minimum value for X axis in bar chart in flex action script 3 file.</p>\n\n<p>Following line in working in MXML file but I want these code in actionscript 3.\n\n \t</p>\n\n<p>    \t\t\t\n    \n\n</p>\n\n<p>can anybody change this into Actionscript 3.</p>\n\n<p>thanks..</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":1,"question_id":13220509,"title":"The application has stopped unexpectedly: How to Debug for flash builder","body":"<p>I need to use the mobile debug mode but every time I run the debug mode.

However, I'm not clear whether this change is expected behavior that I can count on being consistent going forward, or if it's a bug that will likely be fixed sometime in the future, at which point the behavior will revert to the 4.1 way of doing things.  So, my questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Has anyone else run into this issue?  If so, how did you handle\nit?</li>\n<li>If you have developed a workaround, does your solution depend on\na specific SDK version, or does it work for all SDK versions?</li>\n<li>Was the change in behavior from 4.1 to 4.5 intentional, or is\nthis a bug?  I suspect bug, but I've been unable to find anything\ndefinitive one way or the other.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note that my example above is contrived to demonstrate the problem with the least amount of code and minimal complexity.  In my actual project, I have a module that contains a <code>TitleWindow</code> with subcomponents, and I'm trying to have the subcomponents call methods in the <code>TitleWindow</code> (via <code>parentDocument</code>).  So, workarounds that involve other ways of finding the <code>Application</code> object aren't really applicable because the subcomponents are actually looking for a <code>TitleWindow</code>, not the <code>Application</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":25,"score":0,"question_id":13121271,"title":"Flex: disable hand cursor when mouse is over toggle button bar","body":"<p>How can I disable the use of hand cursor when over a toggle button bar?

If I remove that VGroup (and all it's children), the transition plays fine.  Add it back in, and everything blows up again.  I tried using a VBox instead of a VGroup, but there was no change--same error.  I also tried getting rid of horizontalAlign=\"center\", and again, no change.</p>\n\n<p>Some further experimenting reveals that if I only have one child in the VGroup, then the transition works.  As soon as I get two children in the VGroup, however, it throws the error.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if I remove the VGroup completely and simply make the Labels direct children of the GridItem, it fails (same Invalid BitmapData error).  So it seems that perhaps the real culprit is having multiple controls at the same level in the control tree?  E.g., two controls work if they are in a linear parent-child relationship inside the GridItem (GridItem->VGroup->Label), but two labels at the same level (whether their immediate parent is the VGroup or the GridItem) causes the Invalid BitmapData error.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any other control I could use to accomplish what I'm trying to do with the Grid control, which is layout things in a table, with some cells that span into other rows or columns.  TileLayout would work if I didn't need to span into other rows and columns in a few cases.</p>\n\n<p>I've thought about using absolute positioning, but that will make it difficult (impossible?) to easily add/remove other controls into the \"grid,\" which is what I want to do.  When we're running subscription promotionals, we'll add text into certain cells noting how the promotional affects (or does not affect) that particular pricing option.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Here's what the grid looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:Grid id='membershipGrid' &gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"One Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Two Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"5 Year\" fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;!-- Comment out this VGroup, and everything works fine --&gt;\n           &lt;s:VGroup horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Monthly Autorenew\"  fontWeight=\"bold\"/&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"Payment plan option is not available\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n                &lt;s:Label text=\"for multiple year memberhips.\" fontStyle=\"italic\" /&gt;\n           &lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n &lt;mx:GridRow&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:Label text=\"Standard Membership\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardOneYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_ONE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardTwoYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_TWO_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"standardFiveYear\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.STANDARD_FIVE_YEAR).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n      &lt;mx:GridItem horizontalAlign=\"center\"&gt;\n           &lt;s:RadioButton id=\"monthlyAutorenew\" group=\"{membershipTypeSelection}\"\n                             label=\"{pricing.getMembership(MembershipName.MONTHLY_AUTORENEW).currencyPrice}\" /&gt;\n\n      &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt;\n &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"tags":["html","flex","variables"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":32,"score":0,"question_id":13019552,"title":"Possible to get html form field values sent to Flex 3 app even once they're changed?","body":"<p>I have a project where a user will go to username.website.com.</p>\n\n<p>Once the page loads, there will be an HTML form that displays whatever information we have on the user in an HTML form.

Below is a code snippet:</p>\n\n<p>Datagrid</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:GridColumn dataField=\"datf\" headerText=\"Period From\" rendererIsEditable=\"true\"&gt;\n&lt;s:itemRenderer&gt;\n  &lt;fx:Component&gt;\n       &lt;s:GridItemRenderer dataChange=\"updateRenderer()\"&gt;\n            &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n                 &lt;![CDATA[\n                           public function updateRenderer():void {\n                                periodFrom.text = outerDocument.dtf1.format(data.datf);\n                           }\n\n                           private function dateField_labelFunc(item:Date):String {\n                                return outerDocument.dtf1.format(item);\n                           }\n                 ]]&gt;\n            &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n                 &lt;mx:DateField horizontalCenter=\"0\" verticalCenter=\"0\" width=\"90%\" id=\"periodFrom\" labelFunction=\"dateField_labelFunc\"/&gt;\n       &lt;/s:GridItemRenderer&gt;\n  &lt;/fx:Component&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Handler</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function createBillResult_resultHandler(event:ResultEvent):void\n        {\n            var dataProvider = itemsDg.dataProvider;\n            var item = null;\n\n            for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; dataProvider.length; i++){\n                item = dataProvider.getItemAt(i);\n                trace(item.datf);&lt;!--WHAT SHOULD GO HERE--&gt;\n                billItems.lnid = item.lnid;\n                billItems.days = item.days;\n                billItems.ratu = item.ratu;\n                createBillItemsResult.token = billingService.createBillItems(billItems);\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would have thought that I can access the value from the itemrenderer using the dataField property like I do with the other items although these are not itemrenderers, but trace(item.datf) just returns 'undefined'.

We package that ANE for several platforms, including Mac OS and iOS. On the Mac, all is well when we build using the legacy standard C++ library (<code>libstdc++</code>). Of course we  don't want to stay with an obsolete soon-to-be unsupported library and we switched to the current <code>libc++</code>. The library  (.a file) builds fine that way, and so do the native iOS applications that call on that library.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <code>adt</code> Adobe tool that builds ANEs now fail with no useful error message (don't start me on Adobe tools quality). Some trickery with Unix processes let us find out that <code>adt</code> calls the OS linker <code>ld</code>. Replicating the same <code>ld</code> invocation let us find out that the linker complains about a boatload of undefined symbols, all (or perhaps most) being standard C++ library symbols.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed that <code>ld</code> invocation uses as a parameter <code>-lstdc++</code> which refers to the legacy library. I suppose that using libc++ would imply the <code>lc++</code> argument. However, trying such a modified <code>ld</code> failed due to (apparently) unrelated directory issues.</p>\n\n<p>So is there a way to tell <code>adt</code> that our .a library uses the current standard C++ library and not the legacy one?

For example, I want to have a sequence of images fading in at specific times relative to audio being played.  This sequence can be accomplished easily with Adobe Flash Professional, resulting in a SWF, but I want to create Flex-based code that allows for data-driven timing and image source identification.  The technique of setting the playheadTime on the <code>Effect</code> seemed to get me what I wanted.  I can stream audio (which broadcasts time events) perfectly in synch with the animation.  I can also allows the user to seek/scrub the \"timeline\" (via a <code>Slider</code>) and the animation behaves as if it has a true timeline based on key frames.  The technique works <em>almost</em>, so I hope there is a simple solution to my problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ios","flex","audio","playback","game"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":58,"score":-1,"question_id":12845829,"title":"In IOS - playing audio files with various speed and rate - need advise","body":"<p>I am writing a simple app which allows the user to attach a very short (1-2 sec) sound file to pictures ( it is for teaching kids the sounds that animals make ).</p>\n\n<p>The kid will scroll thru the pictures and when the new picture emerges on the screen - the sound should be played.</p>\n\n<p>What I am looking for an advise on is how to make the sounds play faster accordingly to speed the kid scrolls.

doing up until now, is share the catalogFacadeTarget bean with Flex, and with the controllers from the jstl setup. So I can call the same methods I call from flex, now from the controllers with the model and view methods. I thought that this way I would not encounter any problems. Here is my dispatcher-servlet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- URL mapping --&gt;\n&lt;bean id=\"urlMap\"\n    class=\"org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"urlMap\"&gt;\n        &lt;props&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/welcome.htm\"&gt;welcome&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/welcome\"&gt;welcome&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/catalog.htm\"&gt;catalog&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;prop key=\"/catalog\"&gt;catalog&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;/props&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- Controllers --&gt;\n&lt;bean name=\"welcome\"\n    class=\"com.bamboo.catW3.business.impl.Welcome\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"successView\"&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;welcome&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n     &lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"catalogFacadeTarget\"/&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n&lt;bean name=\"catalog\"\n        class=\"com.bamboo.catW3.business.impl.Catalog\"&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"successView\"&gt;\n            &lt;value&gt;catalog&lt;/value&gt;\n        &lt;/property&gt;\n         &lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"catalogFacadeTarget\"/&gt;\n &lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>&lt;bean id=\"viewResolver\" class=\"org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver\"&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"viewClass\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"prefix\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;/WEB-INF/jsp/&lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"suffix\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;.jsp&lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now this was working fine, even though my intellij ide highlights catalogFacadeTarget reference and says that I can't resolve the bean, which would be great: if anyone knows how to make him understand, or maybe make me understand:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;property name=\"catalogFacadeImpl\" ref=\"*catalogFacadeTarget*\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This was working fine for simple objects that do not have complicate relationships, for example I have a table USER that does not relate to anyone, and I can do this from the model and view method on the jstl controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List users = catalogFacadeImpl.getUserList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No problem, I get the list of users and print it. However if I try to make this on a more complicated object, that has relationships with itself and stuff, like with the Object CATEGORY:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List categories = catalogFacadeImpl.getCategoryList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the exceptcion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Request processing failed; nested exception is org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: com.bamboo.catW3.domain.Category.categories, no session or session was closed\norg.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:488)\norg.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.doGet(FrameworkServlet.java:431)\njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:690)\njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:803)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would usually be a problem with the hbm and the way relationships are configured, however, this can't be the case, because from flex I call this very same method and have no trouble. So what I guess is that I'm not sharing the bean as I though i was. Not that would not give me this error either.</p>\n\n<p>I'm really confused now, any suggestion on where to look would be deeply appreciated. Thank you very much, tried to post the hbm just in case it helps somehow, but was to long for this post.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","adobe"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":487,"score":4,"question_id":3412244,"title":"Flex Text to Speech Program","body":"<p>I am developing a Adobe Flex Application which speeches some given text inside a text box.\nHere am supposed to use an inbuilt function or something else, because I dont want to give an outside link to convert the text to speech since Internet connection will not be available.\nSample program written in Air are also applicable\nCan any one post some sample code or link?\nThanks in Advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","matrix","line","shape"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":62,"score":0,"question_id":12828640,"title":"Drawing shapes in Actionscript","body":"<p>So I need to draw some custom shapes in Actionscript on canvas dynamically(like some spinning wheel made of lines and circles).

Does anyone have anything in mind that may be causing this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flash-builder"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":26,"score":0,"question_id":12733810,"title":"Actionscript airxmail embed base 64 encoded image","body":"<p>I'm developing in Flash builder 4.6 and I am capturing a signature which gives me a base64 encoded image, I use airxmail to send a mail to clients etc.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an example of how to embed the base64 encoded image into the body of an email?</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","preventdefault"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":57,"score":1,"question_id":12716874,"title":"Flex: preventDefault on spark:ListBase not working","body":"<p>The proposed UX I am trying to achieve is this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>user clicks menu item (via a listBase subclass: e.g. ButtonBar or TabBar)</li>\n<li>prevent initial selection</li>\n<li>validate if user needs to address issues (e.g. unsaved data on a form, etc.)</li>\n<li>if valid, take selection and set the listBase to that selectedIndex, otherwise present warnings to user and cancel out the selection process altogether</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This does not work as you'd expect.

An HTTPStatusEvent object does not necessarily indicate an error condition; it simply reflects the HTTP status code (if any) that is provided by the networking stack. Some Flash Player environments may be unable to detect HTTP status codes; a status code of 0 is always reported in these cases. Just wanted to add additional findings...through testing we were able to use that same certificate on another server - and despite security warnings, I was able to get data on my test Android device. This makes me think that the issue may be related to the server....It's hosted by Rackspace so we're going to reach out to them to attempt more troubleshooting.\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","sqlite"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":68,"score":0,"question_id":12602666,"title":"Flex: Accessing SQLite entry using 'getItemAt()'","body":"<p>I have an array populated with input from an <code>SQLite</code> database.

I am deep into development.</p>\n\n<p>This morning one of my testers reported seeing a flex based popup that I did not create.</p>\n\n<p>I am not able to post pictures here but to describe the popup - It has a grey header-bar with a small close button which looks more like a flex panel. As far as I'm aware this is not part of the standard flex popup. It then has a question mark image in the top left corner of the main window. I believe this is the stand in graphic that flex uses when it tried to load an image but can't. At the bottom of the popup is a text input box which is pre-filled with an IP address. The address is the same for both myself and the tester. Finally at the very bottom is an OK and a Cancel button.</p>\n\n<p>The buttons are styled because I set a global button skin for my app. Other than that I did not create this popup and cannot find any evidence of it in my scripts.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately fired up the same build that I have on my own iPad. I had tested it before sending out and had not seen any evidence of this before but when I tested it this morning, I too saw this popup. It seems to have literally occurred overnight.</p>\n\n<p>I did some more testing and have discovered that if I turn off all internet connections then the app won't even start. It hangs at the splash screen. I can't be certain about this build but I know that previous builds have most definitely worked offline.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched all through my scripts for something that might cause this. I am not using any reference libraries beyond the standard ones and I'm not using any ANE's. I have also checked other Flex apps that I am working on but they all seem fine.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else come across this before?

This works fine for URLs with no special characters (by either setting the <code>source</code> property or calling <code>load()</code> on <code>Image</code>). However, when a URL is submitted that has special characters which have already been escaped, i.e. in most cases simply copied directly from the URL bar in a browser, <code>URLRequest</code> escapes the percent signs again with '%25', which makes the URL invalid and the server returns an error. Pasting the same URL in a browser loads the image just fine though. I've tried <code>decodeURI()</code> on the URL, but that ignores a large set of characters, so I tried <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>, and that decodes everything correctly, but when <code>URLRequest</code> goes to re-encode it, it ignores the now-decoded special characters and doesn't escape them, so in this case the URL is not valid, because it still has unsafe characters in it and fails. So, how can I send <code>URLRequest</code> something with special characters in it (encoded or unencoded) and have it actually work? Really, I wish it didn't do anything with my URL and let me determine if it's valid or not, but it's embedded in the Flash Player globals swc and is therefore the closed-source piece of flash and I can't see the source code.

events for Flex objects","body":"<p>[Edit]\nThe main question here loosely translates as 'is Flex multi-threaded'? I have since found out that it is not, so I won't have data mysteriously changing half way through an operation. The code below worked, but made things awkward and confusing. I eventually fixed the problem with an architecture change, eliminating the need to suppress events. As the first commenter suggested.</p>\n\n<p>Infinite loops were eliminated by changing the way events were listened to and performing certain actions explicitly rather than via events.</p>\n\n<p>Collating events was made easier using a command pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, do not use the code below if you come across this page!\n[/Edit]</p>\n\n<p>I'm building some Flex applications using a simple, lightweight MVC pattern. Models extend or encapsulate a dispatcher and fire events when updated. I'm stuck with Flex 3.5.</p>\n\n<p>In some situations, I'll want to suppress these events to avoid infinite loops or help collate multiple actions into a single event. </p>\n\n<p>My first stab at a solution that doesn't litter the models with unnecessary and confusing code is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private var _suppressEvents:Boolean = false;\n    public function suppressEvents(callback:Function):void\n    {\n        // In case of error, ensure the suppression is turned off, then re-throw\n        var err:Error = null;\n        _suppressEvents = true;\n        try \n        {\n            callback();\n        }\n        catch(e:Error)\n        {\n            err = e;\n        }\n        _suppressEvents = false;\n        if (err)\n        {\n            throw (err);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function dispatch(type:String, data:*):void\n    {\n        // Suppress if called from a suppress callback.\n        if (!_suppressEvents)\n        {\n\n            _dispatcher.dispatchEvent(new DataEvent(type, data));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously I call 'suppressEvents' with a function containing the model code I wish to run.</p>\n\n<p>My questions:</p>\n\n<p>1: Is there a chance I could accidentally lose events using this technique?</p>\n\n<p>2: Do I need to think about any other error edge cases when it comes to ensuring I don't accidentally end up in a suppressed state after a call?</p>\n\n<p>3: Is there a cleaner way I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","xml-parsing","flex3"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":42,"score":1,"question_id":12530159,"title":"Flex3 can't access value of XML with brackets","body":"<p>I have the following XML object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ns2:errorCode&gt;\n  3001\n&lt;/ns2:errorCode&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How do I access the value if I only have a string saying errorCode.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to do something like:</p>\n\n<p><code>xml['*::'+str]</code> \nwhere <code>xml</code> is the XML object with the above node and <code>str</code> is my string variable containing <code>\"errorCode\"</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flex3","flex2"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":43,"score":0,"question_id":12582399,"title":"Creating vertical scrollbar","body":"<p>I want to create a vertical scrollbar in such a way that we can do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Change the color of the arrow icons of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the background color of the arrow icons of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the TrackColor of the scrollbar.</li>\n<li>Change the ThumbColor of the scrollbar.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","flex3"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":47,"score":0,"question_id":12554433,"title":"How to prevent the flickering associated with addChild in flex?","body":"<p>I have the following application where I'm loading the labels dynamically at run-time and I need them to update every X seconds (3 here in the example).

Without actually having looked at the SDKs, my understanding would have been that AIR enables you to develop Flash (i.e. ActionScript, and apparently also JavaScript/HTML) applications that can be run by the AIR runtime without the need of a browser (such as a pure desktop or smartphone application). The Flex SDK appears to be a collection of classes and additional APIs (similar to JavaFX?) to extend the \"standard\" Flash library.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I've downloaded the most recent versions of both SDKs, and apparently, it's not that simple. So, first I looked at the AIR SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html</a>, v3.4 as of now). As far as I can tell, the \"adt\" utility is the main part of AIR that lets you package finished applications. However, I'm not sure if the AIR SDK actually includes a compiler – say you have a bunch of ActionScript .as files and want to turn them into a .swf or .air file using the AIR SDK, is that even possible?</p>\n\n<p>The Flex SDK (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html</a>, v4.6 as of now) unfortunately didn't help with the confusion. It does include compilers and other tools, but in its \"bin\" folder, I could also find \"adt\" and \"adl\" – the AIR tools! What's more, it also has \"AIR SDK license.pdf\" and \"AIR SDK readme.txt\" files; judging from those, it appears that the Flex SDK includes some older version of the AIR SDK version 2.</p>\n\n<p>To make things even more confusing, I also found a \"combined version of the Flex and AIR® SDKs (Flex SDK 4.6.0.23201 and AIR 3.4.0.2540 SDK)\" on Adobe's site (<a href=\"http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gaming.adobe.com/getstarted/</a>). It seems that this wasn't merely created by copying the AIR 3.4 files to the Flex 4.6 files, adding yet another item to the list.</p>\n\n<p>So, essentially, I'd like to know the differences between these two (three?)

Therefore, the same itemClick event is dispatched when the user clicks the main button or selects the current item from the pop-up menu.

First click event will be dispatched followed by itemClick event. In the Click event handler we are writing code to open the popup so it is opening the popup and in the itemclick event handler respective page navigation code is there so it is navigating to that particular page. (These two are happening one by one so first popup is opening and within seconds it is navigating to the recently opened page because of itemclick handler code. So whenever we are clicking on main button these two actions are happening parallel hence we are getting a popup blink but not stable popup. If we modify anything in itemclick handler it is effecting the functionality of popup button because same handler for both the button clicks. Even the event target is also same in case of itemclick event irrespective of main button or popup button.)</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","flash","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":466,"score":0,"question_id":3349158,"title":"Converting a flex component w/images to bitmap","body":"<p>I am trying to take images I am placing in a flex canvas component to a bitmap.

If you double click on other products the same happens.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have made a context menue for the datagrid. In the context menue you can select \"open product in new window\". If you click that a second instance of the program will be started. And it opens the product in a new tab automatically. Now if I do that again in the first window (app instance 1) it should not open a new window. Instead it should open a new FlexTab in the app instance 2 (second window). And if search for products and use the context menue to open a product in a new window, that will only open a new FlexTab in the app instance 1 (Window 1).</p>\n\n<p>To open the new window I used navigateToUrl(baseurl + fragments, window_name). \nI heard, that you can use the window_name to open the same window (no new window). </p>\n\n<p>E.g.

With some server-side logging as well as some logging hacked into the swf, I know that the UrlLoader is successfully doing and GET'ing a crossdomain.xml file, is correctly processing it (ie: if I wreck it, I get a security error), and is also successfully completing the \"load\" request (the server sends the data).

What seems to have been happening was that the Event.COMPLETE event handler (onComplete in the stack trace) was using the global SP object.  Something about the release (vs debug) compilation must have been affecting the startup timing of the SP variable initialization.

Any pointers, documentation, etc. that anyone can give will be gratefully appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I decided not to include services-config.xml, remoting-config.xml, etc. files in this question since they are large and contain more than is relevant here, but I can supply them on request.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>After reviewing the code I released I'd made an error in this question. The login RPC method is used for unsecure login attempts, whilst logging in via a mx.messaging.ChannelSet is used for secure login. I've updated the question to reflect this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The error returned is an <code>mx.rpc.events.FaultEvent</code> which has the fields:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Fault String: Send failed\nFault Code: Client.Error.MessageSend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The logon function (Flex side) is: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public function login(username:String, password:String, loginFunction:Function = null, failureFunction:Function = null):void {\n    if (_usingSecuredConnection) {\n        this.loginSuccessFunction = loginFunction;\n        this.loginFailureFunction = failureFunction;\n\n        // Make sure that the user is not already logged in.\n        if (_channelSet.authenticated == true) {\n            AlertUtil.alertError(\"You are already logged in!\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        token = _channelSet.login(username, password);\n        token.addResponder(new AsyncResponder(loginResultEvent, loginFaultEvent));\n    } else {\n        // Defer to API\n    SecurityAPI.login(username, password, [onLoginResultNonSecured, loginFunction], [onLoginFailure, failureFunction]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On an attempt to login securely, it always results in the function loginFaultEvent being invoked invoked with the FaultEvent as stated above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that this is now a crossdomain issue. Trying to access https from http is the problem. However I have put what I think is a VERY permissive crossdomain file in the ROOT webapp of my Tomcat server and it has not helped. Anyone know what I am doing wrong? Is it the wrong location for Tomcat7 or have I got a mistake in my crossdomain file? (note: 8443 is my secure port)</p>\n\n<p><strong>crossdomain.xml :</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM \"http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;\n    &lt;site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies=\"all\" /&gt;\n    &lt;allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\" to-ports=\"8443\"/&gt;\n    &lt;allow-http-request-headers-from domain=\"localhost\" headers=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Update 4</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now overcome this issue: It was a crossdomain problem and was fixed by placing a cross-domain file in the ROOT webapp directory of my tomcat server. The content of that cross-domain file is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM \"http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;\n  &lt;allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/&gt;\n&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My flex application now communicates HTTP and HTTPS fine using IE9 and Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>However it still doesn't work on Firefox.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Phil</p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex","actionscript"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":60,"score":0,"question_id":12389821,"title":"Camera crashs after multibel use of .setMode();","body":"<p>I'm developing a video chat application using flex. \nAfter some bandwidth check I want to resize the camera resolution based an the result of it. </p>\n\n<p>But every second time I do that the camera frame freezes and I have to kill the flash player and reastart it.

Now I'm writing some new code to retrieve data from the server, but the server has to first process this data and this takes some time (say 5 to 30 minutes depending on the request). </p>\n\n<p>My design pattern up to now has been to show the user a busy cursor and disable the main application (Flex by default blurs out the application when it's disabled). This generally lasts a second or two while the communication completes. However, now the communication takes a long time to complete, and I'd like to be able to have the user continue to use the application even though the process from the server hasn't returned yet. </p>\n\n<p>So what I'd like to do is NOT disable the main application so the user can interact with it while he/she waits for the data to return. The problem I worry about is if the user uses the application to send another process to the server during this time (e.g. before the first process comes back) -- will this cause problems? That is, is BlazeDS smart enough to know the channel is busy and therefore will queue the requests automagically? For example, will BlazeDS wait until the first request comes back before sending the second, or third, etc?</p>\n\n<p>Or do I have to manually control this communication somehow to ensure it occurs in a serial fashion? If so, are there any design patterns to handle this?</p>\n\n<p>Or, can BlazeDS send and get back a second request before the first one returns?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice much appreciated. I'm looking for ways to avoid having the user stare at a unusable application for 5 to 30 minutes waiting for data to return. A busy cursor is fine, because it shows the data has not returned yet, but a disabled main application particularly (whether it's blurred or not) is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>Here I'm talking about simultaneous calls to different methods, rather than the same method. So if I have two methods, I'd like to call the first method, and while it is waiting to come back, call a second or third method, which return safely before (finally) the first method returns.

If result is null is their anyway to figure out why it is null, meaning checking if the WSDL is available or not, and if it is a valid request?</p>\n\n<p>I am running a Net Monitor in the app to make sure it is online.</p>\n\n<p>My code is as follows for the login process</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;s:View xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n        xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\"\n        xmlns:pingdomapi=\"services.pingdomapi.*\"\n        title=\"Login\"&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Script&gt;\n        &lt;![CDATA[\n            import valueObjects.Auth_CredentialsData;\n\n\n            protected function login(event:MouseEvent):void\n            {\n                var credentials:Auth_CredentialsData = new Auth_CredentialsData;\n                credentials.username = txt_username.text;\n                credentials.password = txt_password.text;\n                Auth_loginResult.token = pingdomAPI.Auth_login('****',credentials);\n                trace(Auth_loginResult.token.result);\n            }\n        ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Script&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;\n        &lt;s:CallResponder id=\"Auth_loginResult\"/&gt;\n        &lt;pingdomapi:PingdomAPI id=\"pingdomAPI\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;\n    &lt;s:Label x=\"10\" y=\"10\" text=\"Username\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:TextInput id=\"txt_username\" x=\"10\" y=\"41\" text=\"david.long@cagedata.com\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:Label x=\"10\" y=\"104\" text=\"Password\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:TextInput id=\"txt_password\" x=\"10\" y=\"135\" displayAsPassword=\"true\" text=\"Simpsons#1\"/&gt;\n    &lt;s:Button id=\"btn_login\" y=\"198\" right=\"30\" label=\"Login\" click=\"login(event)\"/&gt;\n&lt;/s:View&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":336,"score":2,"question_id":6192347,"title":"FLEX XMLDecoder WTF!","body":"<p>Could someone explain why the FLEX 4.5 XMLDecoder does this to my XML-data?</p>\n\n<pre><code>var decoder:XMLDecoder = new XMLDecoder;\nvar $object:Object = decoder.decode( &lt;xmltag&gt;08.00&lt;/xmltag&gt; );\n// object = \"08.00\"\n\nvar decoder:XMLDecoder = new XMLDecoder;\nvar $object:Object = decoder.decode( &lt;xmltag&gt;11.00&lt;/xmltag&gt; );\n// Object = \"11\" (HEY!

On Flex 3, when you set your application layout as absolute, the X and Y properties automatically lose their utility since every component of your layout will be determined automatically by default in the top left of your screen. It works similarly as the mobile layouts: You either use Canvas to set X and Y (most used by mobile game developers) or you let the device to place everything so it will avoid screen size problems and such.</p>\n\n<p>Is it still possible on Flex 4?

The thing is that in Flex 3 I could place 1 VBox, for instance, and 3 HBox inside it that each HBox would assume a position automatically one under the other, that is with X and Y properties blank. With Flex 4, when I place 1 VGroup and 3 HGroup inside without setting any X and Y propert, they'll just fill up one above the other, like if I had set X,Y = 0 to all of them. They don't assume position one under the other like it used to.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","dynamic-data","cdata","httpservice","htmltext"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":108,"score":0,"question_id":12315632,"title":"flex 4.6 parsing htmlText object with CDATA only last object displaying","body":"<p>I am trying to update multiple <code>&lt;mx:text&gt;</code> objects with a <code>htmlText</code> string.

The same scenario works perfectly fine on Android 4.0. The problem is happening only on Android 2.x devices. We haven't been able to test honeycomb yet.</p>\n\n<p>After reading the Android documents, I understand that onDestroy is either called when someone calls finish on the activity or if the device is running low on space.

This would return true if activity has been destroyed by calling finish. </p>\n\n<p>In our case, in the scenario described above, activity's finish function is <strong>not</strong> called. <strong>onDestroy</strong> is called when the app resumes but isFinishing() still returns <strong>true</strong>. This suggests that the app is not low on memory.

BUT if I put the textArea (note) in both states then it works correctly (ie incluedIn=\"note,list\" works)! </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Group id=\"noteGroup\" includeIn=\"note\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:TextArea id=\"normalTextArea\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;/s:Group&gt;\n\n\n&lt;s:transitions&gt;\n    &lt;s:Transition fromState=\"note\" toState=\"list\"\n                  autoReverse=\"false\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:Sequence target=\"{this}\"\n                    duration=\"{duration}\" &gt;\n            &lt;s:Rotate3D angleYFrom=\"0\" angleYTo=\"90\" \n                        autoCenterTransform=\"true\" \n                        applyChangesPostLayout=\"true\"\n                        /&gt;\n            &lt;s:SetAction target=\"{noteGroup}\" property=\"visible\" /&gt;\n            &lt;s:RemoveAction target=\"{noteGroup}\" /&gt;\n            &lt;s:AddAction target=\"{listGroup}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;s:Rotate3D angleYFrom=\"-90\" angleYTo=\"0\" \n                        autoCenterTransform=\"true\" \n                        applyChangesPostLayout=\"true\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:Sequence&gt;\n    &lt;/s:Transition&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:Transition fromState=\"list\" toState=\"note\"\n                  autoReverse=\"false\"\n                  &gt;\n        &lt;s:Sequence target=\"{this}\" duration=\"{duration}\" &gt;\n\n            &lt;s:Rotate3D angleYFrom=\"0\" angleYTo=\"-90\" \n                        effectStart=\"trace('rotateStart')\"\n                        duration=\"250\" \n                        autoCenterTransform=\"true\"\n                        applyChangesPostLayout=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n            &lt;s:AddAction target=\"{noteGroup}\"\n                        effectStart=\"trace('add notes action')\"/&gt;\n            &lt;s:SetAction target=\"{noteGroup}\" property=\"visible\" /&gt;\n            &lt;s:RemoveAction target=\"{listGroup}\" \n                        effectStart=\"trace('remove lists action')\"/&gt;\n\n            &lt;s:Rotate3D angleYFrom=\"90\" angleYTo=\"0\" \n                        effectStart=\"trace('rotateStart 2')\"\n                        duration=\"250\" \n                        autoCenterTransform=\"true\"\n                        applyChangesPostLayout=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;/s:Sequence&gt;\n    &lt;/s:Transition&gt;\n\n&lt;/s:transitions&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>~~ <strong>UPDATE</strong> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n\n<p>A work around I mentioned is to include the textarea in both states and then set the visible to false in the state that it was not originally included in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Group id=\"noteGroup\" \n         includeIn=\"note,list\"\n         visible.list=\"false\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:TextArea id=\"normalTextArea\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;/s:Group&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>~~ <strong>UPDATE</strong> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\nSetting the value later (after the transition) works (thanks Flextras) but the text is not visible until I place the cursor in the textarea. </p>\n\n<p>List change handler code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function list1_changeHandler(event:IndexChangeEvent):void {\n    content = (list.selectedItem as Note).content;\n    currentState = \"note\";\n\n    setTimeout(setText,1000);\n}\n\nprivate function setText():void {\n    normalTextArea.text = content; // works but only on clicking into the textarea\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>THIS DOES NOT WORK:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        protected function list1_changeHandler(event:IndexChangeEvent):void {\n            content = (list.selectedItem as Note).content;\n            normalTextArea.text = content;\n            trace('1 text ='+normalTextArea.text); // contains content\n            currentState = \"note\";\n            normalTextArea.text = content;\n            trace('2 text ='+normalTextArea.text); // contains content\n\n            setTimeout(setText,1000);\n        }\n\n        // scenario 1\n        private function setText():void {\n            normalTextArea.text = content; // clicking into textarea it is empty\n        }\n\n        // scenario 2\n        private function setText():void {\n            normalTextArea.text = \"\"; // this does work but\n            normalTextArea.text = content; // you have to click into textarea\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex","oop","events","actionscript"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":114,"score":0,"question_id":12220935,"title":"Actionscript OOP multiple method call architecture issue","body":"<p>I have a class: DatabaseService.as This class creates a local sqlite connection and creates tables if they do not exist.

I cannot believe this to be such a confusing topic as every software program we create must be able to save user input, right.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the problem:\nNovel writing software program Main window has tabnavigator with four navigatorcontent pages 1. characters, 2. worlds, 3. objects, 4. Editor</p>\n\n<p>Each navigatorcontent page has user input fields in the form of textinput component, textarea component, richtexteditor component, etc. </p>\n\n<p>problem 1:\nThe user needs to be able to open a new project and give it a name and state where it must be saved. All user input in the Novel writing software program must be attached to the file name the user specified - cannot give sample code cause I don't even know where to start looking anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 2:\nIf the user has now defined a new project name, all his input from the different input components has to be compiled into a single file that can be saved. (Dan Pichelman gave me a satisfactory answer on using the file.borwseforsave funtion.) That makes sense, but I first need to get all the user input into that single file. I was convinced that it must be an xml file and that there would be a guide on how to do this but...</p>\n\n<p>Problem 3:\nThis brings me to another problem. All the pages I've researched so  far tell me how to load data from an xml file into a component, but not how to write the text from the component into the xml file. And this xml file cannot be the prefs file in the storage directory, it has to be named by the user and then after filling in all his text in the different tabs of the software, must be saved in this xml file and saved where the user chooses.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 4:\nnow that the user put in his text and it is written to an xml file that he has named and set the path to, he goes on vacation and in two weeks opens his saved file to work on his project again. All the data that was stored in the xml must now be written back into the different user input components so he can continue working on his project, truth be told, there are some samles and tutorials on this subject, but again from only a single page perspective not a multiple tab perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 5:\nNow the user has deleted and/or changed some text he put in when he started, he wrote some more text in the textareas and texteditor and he clicks the file - save button. The xml file or whatever needs to be used must be updated and saved with all the changes overwriting the old file. </p>\n\n<p>Problem 6:\nThe data entered by the user will end up being a book of say 400 pages. This data will obviously be mostly in the richtexteditor component, so whatever method of saving is used, database or xml or whatever, needs to be able to contain all this data.</p>\n\n<p>Thought, if you are working with for instance, microsoft powerpoint, it has multiple pages all containing different user inputs and when you click flie - save, it saves all that input into one file. When I as a user opens that saved file it loads all that content back into its place and I can change and manipulate the input and save it again. I would have thought this would be one of the first things adobe or any other software would teach as this is what sofware programs are all about. But alas, the tutorials on this subject for adobe air for Desktop application is extreeeeemely rare. </p>\n\n<p>My promise is, if someone can help me with this or there is a tutorial out there that covers this properly I  will write a tutorial on this for other newbies as I progress step by step.   </p>\n\n<p>Pleeeeeeease help this ignorant novice\nRegards </p>\n"},{"tags":["flex"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":24,"score":0,"question_id":12226905,"title":"How to add the muliple link and play the videos in flex?","body":"<p>Hai i have application to play the single video,,i need to add the muliple video.how to do this ,,very urgent requirement.kindly reply me..</p>\n\n<p>Now i have one link like <a href=\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/cuepoints.flv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/cuepoints.flv</a>\"\nSuppose i have multiple link</p>\n\n<pre><code>import mx.utils.ObjectUtil;\n\n            private var nc:NetConnection;\n            private var ns:NetStream;\n            private var video:Video;\n            private var meta:Object;\n\n            private function init():void {\n                var nsClient:Object = {};\n                nsClient.onMetaData = ns_onMetaData;\n\n\n                nc = new NetConnection();\n                nc.connect(null);\n\n                ns = new NetStream(nc);\n                play();\n\n                ns.client = nsClient;\n\n                video = new Video();\n                video.attachNetStream(ns);\n                uic.addChild(video);\n            }\n            private function play():void{\n                ns.play(\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/cuepoints.flv\" \");\n            }\n            private function ns_onMetaData(item:Object):void {\n                trace(\"meta\");\n                meta = item;\n                // Resize Video object to same size as meta data.\n                video.width = item.width;\n                video.height = item.height;\n                // Resize UIComponent to same size as Video object.\n                uic.width = video.width;\n                uic.height = video.height;\n\n            }\n\n\n        ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/mx:Script&gt;\n\n    &lt;mx:Panel id=\"panel\" visible=\"false\"&gt;\n        &lt;mx:UIComponent id=\"uic\" /&gt;\n        &lt;mx:ControlBar&gt;\n            &lt;mx:Button label=\"Play/Pause\" click=\"ns.togglePause();\" /&gt;\n            &lt;mx:Button label=\"Rewind\" click=\"ns.seek(0); ns.pause();\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/mx:ControlBar&gt;\n    &lt;/mx:Panel&gt;\n\n&lt;/mx:Application&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["flex","url","href","navigatetourl"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":94,"score":0,"question_id":12214897,"title":"flex 4.6 set browser url like window.location for pages within same base url","body":"<p>flex 4.6</p>\n\n<p>seems like a noob Q. but I would like to change the browser url page not domain, from <code>http://myUrl.com/page1</code> to <code>http://myUrl.com/page2</code>.

However I need to know whether this is true before I tell my boss that we need more memory.  If there is a chance this is just configurable or something, I need to try that first.  If it's basically of a computer resources issue due to not meeting the minimum requirements, I need a way to explain that that's exactly what the problem is.

Using the include directive brings the code from the external file into the original file at compile time placing it in the same scope. </p>\n\n<p>For example,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Application.mxml:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Application&gt;\n\n    &lt;source=\"external.mxml\"/&gt;\n\n&lt;/Application&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>External.mxml:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Styles/&gt;\n\n&lt;Declarations&gt;\n    &lt;Object id=\"test\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Declarations&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need to keep this code/mxml/xml in the external file in scope with the original. Do not ask me why I want to do this. </p>\n\n<p>Another example.

So I create a MXML file, MyGroup.mxml or MyGroup.as and that extends Group that contains the clickHandler code. </p>\n\n<p>The problem with this method is that I am then locked to the class type I'm extending, hardcoding the view. So for example I would have to extend Group if the MXML class I want to split into separate files is a Group. </p>\n\n<p>I've worked on projects where this was done and it is not good. People start setting styles and visual aspects or group / view specific properties in the code behind class and later if or when we need to change it or the layout it we have end up with all these dependencies to the container. It becomes a mess. Plus, using Code Behind you can't reuse it (reuse in the way include styles.as is reused).

Can I just run it on one server, and default the host like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Security.loadPolicyFile(\"xmlsocket://oneDBserver:2000\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or do I need to run the script on every DB server?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":311,"score":0,"question_id":2490851,"title":"Asynchronous file upload in flex","body":"<p>Looking for a sample for asynchronous file upload using flex filereference object</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript-3"],"answer_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":5177,"score":7,"question_id":2435116,"title":"Actionscript flex: Converting # colors to uint","body":"<p>I'm working with several components that take color as a uint, but the colors I have are in the format of \"#161616\".

However, in one tab, I switch between two views - a list view and a detail view.</p>\n\n<p>The main view:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:TabNavigator id=\"tabNavigator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" change=\"MainViewModel.getInstance().onTabClick(event);\" resizeToContent=\"true\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:NavigatorContent label=\"Welcome\" minWidth=\"950\" width=\"100%\" minHeight=\"300\" height=\"100%\"&gt;\n            &lt;startview:StartView width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/s:NavigatorContent&gt;\n        &lt;s:NavigatorContent id=\"documentTab\" minWidth=\"950\" width=\"100%\" minHeight=\"300\" height=\"100%\" label=\"Document\"&gt;\n            &lt;documentview:DocumentView width=\"100%\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" visible=\"{model.documentList}\" /&gt;\n            &lt;documentdetailview:DocumentDetailView width=\"100%\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" visible=\"{model.documentDetail} \"/&gt;\n        &lt;/s:NavigatorContent&gt;\n&lt;/mx:TabNavigator&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the list, I have a column with a \"detail\" link calling function setDocumentDetailView():</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function setDocumentDetailView() : void {\n    documentList = false; // the list is not displayed\n    documentDetail = true; // the detail is displayed\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the detail view, I have a button to return back to the list calling function setDocumentListView():</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function setDocumentListView() : void {\n    documentList = true; // tje\n    documentDetail = false;\n    setDocumentDetailViewHeight(300);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So far, it works fine.</p>\n\n<p>First problems arrise because of different minimal height of the list and the detail. To show the vertical scrollbar and to display all the content of the particular view, minimal height of the NavigatorContent id=\"documentTab\" must be set. This is done in the functions above.</p>\n\n<p>More problems appear because the detail is dependent on the document displayed. It consists of several panels with conditional visibility. Therefore, the minimal height is different for various documents (according to its type as well as the length of the text of the document). Therefore I need to determine the minHeight according to the content and set the minHeight of the \"documentTab\" accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>I found the \"updateComplete\" event that is called after the view is rendered. If I get the value of the height of the VGroup containing all the conditional panels, I have the correct height needed to be set for the outer NavigatorContent \"documentTab\". I pass this height to a function in MainModel that sets the minHeight of the tab. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public function onUpdateComplete(): void {\n        if (MainViewModel.getInstance().documentDetail) {\n            height = view.documentDetail.height;\n            MainViewModel.getInstance().setDocumentDetailViewHeight(height);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seemed to work correctly as well. Until ...</p>\n\n<p>I recently found out, that if I follow the following scenario it fails:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Display list of documents.</li>\n<li>Display detail of a document A.</li>\n<li>Go back to the list.</li>\n<li>Display the same document A.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this case, the detail view is not rerendered, because the objects displayed are the same with the same height and width. Therefore, the updateComplete event is not triggered and the minHeight remain set to 300 (because of the list minHeight set in the previous step). The panels in the detail go over the outer \"documentTab\" and scrollbar does not appear. The same situation appears when I go to another document with similar content (same panels visible and same proportions).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a working solution for this situation?</p>\n\n<p>I have already tried even the \"show\" event to set the height to the value stored in the attribute. But it did not work. Worse, it started to behave really odd, because the value of \"height\" variable was set only to a bigger value than before, but never to smaller. When the view could be smaller, the variable kept the value from the previous size. And when the view needed bigger height, the variable took the new higher value. This resulted in resizing the view permanently to the maximal discovered size while visiting details of various documents and keeping this big height - have a lot of empty space and scrollbars for all document details.</p>\n\n<p>I am getting really tired of this unpredictable behaviour of Flex :( So, if anyone have an idea what I should try to make this work, I would be really happy.</p>\n"},{"tags":[".net","flex","styles"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":12061320,"title":"How to get default style flex in css","body":"<p>We have a requirement to create a few web pages in .NET that will be hosted in an existing flex site.

To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects.  I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page.  I've taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering.  </p>\n\n<p>In regards to paging I'm using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page.  This way whenever a user comes back to a page that I've saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice.  Basically, I'm caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data.</p>\n\n<p>There are several things that can expire my cache.  Filtering and sorting are the main reason.  However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor.  The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale.  I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve.</p>\n\n<p>So let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing.  In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record (the editor handles saving its data).</p>\n\n<p>Since I'm using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML (this is handled already for other portions of our software).  All data is handled through XML in e4x.  The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList.</p>\n\n<p>Now let me show you my code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>var idOfReplacee:String = this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0].@Id;\nvar xmlToReplace:XMLList = this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee);\n\nif(xmlToReplace.length() &gt; 0)\n{\n    delete (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]);\n    this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, I get the id of the node I want to replace.  Then I find it in the cache's Data property (XMLList).  I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the XMLList.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I have is with the delete line.  I cannot make that line delete that node from the list.  The line following the delete line works.  I've added the node to the list.</p>\n\n<p>How do I replace or delete that node (meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cache)???</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the underscores for all of my variables do not stay escaped when this is posted! otherwise this.&amp;#95 == this._</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","actionscript-3","air"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":341,"score":0,"question_id":6606564,"title":"Does anyone know how to capture the mouse in Flex/Flash Air application?","body":"<p>Does someone know how to capture the mouse in an air application.

Why the GPU mode is making the Flash movie so painful?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for advance!</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","file-download"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"question_id":11895077,"title":"File is damaged when Flex is writing stream","body":"<p>I'm get file content on my host and save the file via this functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function fileDownload(fileName:String):void\n{\n    var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n    loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onCompleteFileDownload);\n    loader.load(new URLRequest(\"http://samed.us/\"+fileName));\n}\nprivate function onCompleteFileDownload(e:Event):void\n{\n    saveFile(\"test.jpg\",URLLoader(e.target).data);\n}\nprivate var Depo:File = File.documentsDirectory.resolvePath(\"testFiles\");\nprivate function saveFile(fileName:String, content:String):void\n{\n    var file:* = Depo.resolvePath(fileName);\n    var stream:FileStream = new FileStream()\n    stream.open(file, FileMode.WRITE);\n    stream.writeUTFBytes(content);\n    stream.close();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://samed.us/bg2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this image</a> can be displayed.

For example: this tab bar is just missing buttons</p>\n\n<p>Before (The working 4.5 version)\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DmdXL.png\" alt=\"Working, Flex 4.5 version of TabBar\"></p>\n\n<p>After (The broken 4.6 version)\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CcvZo.png\" alt=\"Broken, Flex 4.6 version of TabBar\"></p>\n\n<p>In trying to establish what's going on here I've been playing around with the app as best I can (with the welcome UI gone this is rather hard) and I've found that minimizing the application then restoring it will cause the app to hang to the point where Windows adds the \"(Not Responding)\" bit to the app title bar then resume normally with the UI kinda-sorta-mostly working. Some sample images:</p>\n\n<p>Welcome View after restore (Note the horizontal rule that is going far off to the right)\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pmxA7.png\" alt=\"Welcome view after restore\"></p>\n\n<p>TabBar after restore (This content is completely disregarding layout rules. Further it's actually scrolling to the left -- that's right, it somehow grew legs and is just moving off the screen all on it's own. There was never any tweening/animation code attached to this view)\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KPE3v.png\" alt=\"TabBar after restoring, misaligned content\"></p>\n\n<p>All of this is happening on Windows 7 x64 with Flash Builder 4.6.</p>\n\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n\n<p>What the heck is going on here? Why would my UI just disappear like this?</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I'm missing something fundamental like \"oh, just add this compiler option\" and BAM! things will be fixed. I certainly don't feel that my app should be so completely broken with this upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone experienced a similar issue in upgrading to Flex 4.6/AIR 3.x from previous versions of Flex/AIR? How did you solve your problem?</p>\n\n<p>Could it be my custom skins causing this problem? Why would that happen? On the topic of skins this seems like a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8502204/spark-lifecycle-changes-between-flex-4-5-and-4-6\">similar question</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Update</h1>\n\n<p>I was hoping to avoid this but I wasn't really getting anywhere with this so I decided to start pulling out the theme and external SWCs until I could get the app to some sane level of functionality and work back from there. I started with the theme and, while the problem wasn't with the theme is pointed me in the correct direction.</p>\n\n<p>In my app there is a class called <code>HRule</code>. It's the horizontal rule between the \"Open from Dealers\" and \"Logout\" buttons in some of the above screen shots. This class is simply a Spark <code>Group</code> with two <code>Line</code>s inside that draw the rule.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the complete class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;s:Group \n    xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\" \n    xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n    xmlns:mx=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx\"&gt;\n    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here --&gt;\n\n    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:layout&gt;\n        &lt;s:VerticalLayout\n            gap=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;/s:VerticalLayout&gt;\n    &lt;/s:layout&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:Line\n        xTo=\"{width}\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:stroke&gt;\n            &lt;s:SolidColorStroke\n                color=\"#000000\"\n                alpha=\"0.4\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/s:stroke&gt;\n    &lt;/s:Line&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:Line\n        xTo=\"{width}\"&gt;\n        &lt;s:stroke&gt;\n            &lt;s:SolidColorStroke\n                color=\"#ffffff\"\n                alpha=\"0.15\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/s:stroke&gt;\n    &lt;/s:Line&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/s:Group&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then use this class like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:VGroup\n    width=\"300\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:Button \n        label=\"Button 1\"\n        percenthWidth=\"100\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;mycomps:HRule \n        percenthWidth=\"100\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;s:Button \n        label=\"Button 2\"\n        percenthWidth=\"100\"/&gt;\n\n&lt;/s:VGroup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can fix all my problems simply by changing the base class from <code>Group</code> to <code>SkinnableContainer</code>. I downloaded <a href=\"http://winmerge.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WinMerge</a> to do a diff on the 4.5 version of Spark <code>Group</code> and the 4.6 version and the files are identical.</p>\n\n<p>So this brings up a new question: <strong>why would the behavior of <code>Group</code> change between 4.5 and 4.6?</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":["flash","flex","list","spinner","builder"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":112,"score":0,"question_id":11868221,"title":"is there a spinner for flash builder like this","body":"<p>Is there a spark component that acts like this?</p>\n\n<p>I've tried a spinner list and a combo box they both didn't look good in the app. </p>\n\n<p>Please post sample code.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13476805/23l06dy.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13476805/spinner.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","flex","flash-builder","fms"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":0,"question_id":11874908,"title":"How to send variables to serverside (main.asc) from the client swf using Flex, AS3 and Flash Builder","body":"<p>I've searched through Google, FMS Guru and a ton of Adobe developer tutorials.

Though I have a problem, I don't get autocompletion for the metadata.</p>\n\n<p>I'll tell you what I did, maybe you find an error. I want to create my own Style metadata tag named e.g. MyStyle. I want to create my own because it's easier for me to determine at runtime if the metadata was added by me or by the flex framework (therefore I will not use the predefined Style metadata tag).</p>\n\n<p>To add metadata is pretty simple, I just wrote this code to get it work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;s:Group xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n         xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n         width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"&gt;\n\n     &lt;fx:Metadata&gt;\n         [MyStyle(required=\"true\")]\n     &lt;/fx:Metadata&gt;\n&lt;/s:Group&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On my WindowedApplication component I added an added to stage listener to the stage. So all elements that are added to the application will fire that Event.ADDED when they are added to the stage. In that eventHandler I scan added elements for my metadata tag.</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected function addedToStageListener(event:Event):void\n{\n    var classInfo:XML = describeType(event.target);\n    for each (var x:XML in classInfo..metadata)\n    {\n        if (x.@name == \"MyStyle\")\n            trace(x);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also added a flex-config.xml file (in the toplevel of my src folder) to add the compiler options, so that I can read my custom metadata tag on runtime. The file looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;flex-config&gt;\n    &lt;compiler&gt;\n        &lt;keep-as3-metadata&gt;\n            &lt;name&gt;MyStyle&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;/keep-as3-metadata&gt;\n    &lt;/compiler&gt;\n&lt;/flex-config&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run this, I get the result I expect </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;metadata name=\"MyStyle\"&gt;\n  &lt;arg key=\"required\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n&lt;/metadata&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this works. My next step was to add autocompletion when adding the metadata tag to the code. To do this you should create a metadata.xml which specifies the metadata tags right?\nSo I did this and I ended up with this simple metadata.xml</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;annotations version=\"2.1.1\"&gt;\n    &lt;metadata name=\"MyStyle\" description=\"Adds style.\"&gt;\n        &lt;context name=\"class\" /&gt;\n        &lt;attribute name=\"required\" type=\"Boolean\" required=\"true\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/metadata&gt;\n&lt;/annotations&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add the metadata.xml correctly to the project I followed <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flashbuilder/using/WSe4e4b720da9dedb5344c6f711358acdda1d-7fff.html#WSe4e4b720da9dedb56fd3caca12e6bb494bb-7ff0\" rel=\"nofollow\">that tutorial by Adobe</a>, but it doesn't work.

The first one is via snmp traps, a thread is started and wait for any trap, as one is received an alarm will be sent. The second method is via a polling mechanism, at the beginning of the web application a thread is started and will poll after a constant amount of time the alarms and send them to the client.

It is a prototype video player using an ANE (Native Extension). The video player will be used later on in a much larger project.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the issue I am having is sizing and positioning, and I believe the issue is because I am setting an applicationDPI of 160 for the project.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what is happening. The ANE is, essentially, a glorified StageWebView that has a ton of extra features built into it and offers no GUI (the main draw over using StageWebView). This item is positioned in the global space like StageWebView and no matter what I try, I cannot get it to position and size correctly. This is, essentially, what is responsible for the sizing and placement of the player</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.height = 50% of stage\nthis.width = 50% of stage\nthis.globalPoint:Point = this.localToGlobal(new Point(0,0));\n\nthis.viewPort = new Rectangle (this.globalPoint.x,this.globalPoint.y,this.width,this.height - 35); //35 = height of controls\nthis.videoPlayer = new VideoPlayer(this.stage,this.viewPort); //VideoPlayer(stage:Stage,viewPort:Rectangle)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, in my head, this looked to be perfect. It's not in the display list, but to the end user, it would appear like it was. It would stay glued to 0,0 of the parent class (along with the help of a Resize function, of course) and the video would be the size of the appropriate area.</p>\n\n<p>I was wrong. It was positioned way off and sized far larger on my Retina iPad. After collecting a ton of data and doing the math, I found a constant of 4/3 that everything seemed to be off by. The DPI change for the iPad is 3/2 (160 -> 240) so I don't think that is the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I also came up with this simple equation for compensating for the DPI shift.</p>\n\n<pre><code>newValue = (oldValue / (DeviceManager.applicationDPI / FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication.applicationDPI) ); //DeviceManager.applicationDPI is a static getter that returns either 160, 240, or 320 based on Adobe's predefined ranges\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have not tested this on an iPad 1/2 or iPhone yet, but I'm worried that my magic constant is, in reality, just the aspect ratio being factored in to things.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any idea why the positioning is all messed up? It's not the localToGlobal, because even manually entering values that should have worked led to disaster.</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","textinput"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":1112,"score":0,"question_id":971201,"title":"Adobe Flex - Textinput messing up with commas","body":"<p>In Adobe Flex, I'm trying to restrict the input to allow the user to type only a list of IP addresses, separated by a space or a comma.

This is telling me something isn't right, but is it the persistencemanager not saving the data properly? Do I need to check if pm.save() returns true, and if it does, should I dispatch an event and only THEN run the trace statement to get the proper length? That seems overly complicated just to save some data, so I'm not entirely sure whats going on or how to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, what I'm asking is if my current setup is correct, and if its not, does anyone have a simple example, or could create a simple example based on my code for how to properly use persistencemanager?</p>\n\n<p>Once I get this technique down I can create several other apps as well, so Im really hoping to get this nailed down.

The thing is we have very little knowledge about them and we have only 3 months to do it (it doesn't have to be super complicated). So my question is: what, in your opinion, would be the fastest way to learn them both? I guess we need to know some JSP, Serlvets, JPA (??), Flex, maybe JavaScript+CSS? Anything else like EJB? Should we also learn Spring (or Struts)?

The scenario is simple, we have an visible object and we want a border around it. I built a graphics component that draws a <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/spark/primitives/Rect.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rect</a>. That Rect was defined as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>object; // the object which should get the border, defined somewhere outside, \n        // just fyi\n\n\nvar borderThickness:Number = 10;    \nrect.x = object.x - borderThickness;\nrect.y = object.y - borderThickness;\nrect.width = object.width + (borderThickness * 2);\nrect.height = object.height + (borderThickness * 2);\nrectStroke.weight = borderThickness;\n\n//the MXML code\n&lt;s:Rect id=\"rect\"&gt;\n  &lt;s:stroke&gt;\n    &lt;s:SolidColorStroke id=\"rectStroke\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/s:stroke&gt;\n&lt;/s:Rect&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I thought it should like this (just for illustration, not an exact image of what it should be, the border in this illustration is exactly around the object)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oLtWT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>But I was wrong because the border did cover some parts of the objects on the right and on the bottom. My next thought was, that the stroke of the border doesn't grow inside the component, but on each side of the border in equally parts. What I mean by that is that when it grows inside the component and you place it at the location x = 0, y = 0 the width in my example of the left side of the border would be from 0 to 10. The thicker the border gets, the more it grows to the inside until there is just one big rectangle. </p>\n\n<p>When I say it grows equally to each part of the border I mean that if you place the rect on x = 0, y = 0 and your border is 10px thick, the left side of the border goes from -5 to 5.\nI hope it's clear what I mean.</p>\n\n<p>So, as I said before I thought the border grows equally to both parts of the stroke. So I changed the calculations of the width and height to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>rect.width = object.width + borderThickness;\nrect.height = object.height + borderThickness;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the width and height of the object is just increase the borderThickness (half of the borderThickness on every side). I thought now the border should fit exactly the object (as I expected it with my first version too...). </p>\n\n<p>It look better than the first version but still some parts on the right and the left of the object are covered. </p>\n\n<p>After a long time of thinking why it doesn't work as I expect I found a solution that worked for me. It seems that the stroke doesn't grow to equal parts on both sides, it seems that it grows by 75% to the inside and 25% to the outside. The following illustration shows what I mean by that.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bctCm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The yellow line inside the border shows the actual border (when the stroke would be 1px). You can see that it is now exactly in the middle of the stroke but 75% from the inside and 25% from the outside. </p>\n\n<p>My Question is, does anybody experience a similar behavior? Does anyone know why that works the way it does. Am I using it correct? Or what am I doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p>The documentation of Adobe doesn't really tell you that the SolidColorStroke works this way. If you need more code, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>kind regards<br />\nMarkus</p>\n"},{"tags":["android","actionscript-3","flex","mobile-application","swfloader"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":260,"score":0,"question_id":9598504,"title":"load flex application in flex mobile application","body":"<p>I want to load a flex application in mobile flex application and also i want it to interact with the parent application.\nRight now I am trying to load the swf with swfLoader in mobile app, but it gives me security error.\nAnd also should I want the parent application to be generic in terms of child application...as in down the line if someone wants he can have another child application with same name run.</p>\n\n<p>This is in the main application:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    private function connectHandler(event:Event):void {\n      NativeApplication.nativeApplication.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, handleKeys, false, 0, true);\n      mySWFLoader.source=\"file:///sdcard/Galaxy/Teacher/Shell.swf\";\n      mySWFLoader.visible = true; \n      mySWFLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,swfLoaderHandler);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flex"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":138,"score":1,"question_id":11751096,"title":"Flex/AS3: removing item from ListCollectionView","body":"<p>I used a temporary array to populate a ListCollectionView.

Adobe Flex","body":"<p>I have a DataGrid with RadioButtons in one column using itemRenderer. The DataGrid resides on a TitleWindow which is created and popped-up everytime the user clicks a button. The dataProvider for the DataGrid is an ArrayCollection, and the RadioButtons are selected or not based on a boolean value in each ArrayCollection item when the window and DataGrid is displayed. If the user clicks a different RadioButton in the DataGrid, then the ArrayCollection items are updated with the new boolean values.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is with the RadioButton in the first row keeping its selected value. With the RadioButtons in the all other rows, when the TitleWindow and DataGrid are displayed, the correct RadioButton is selected based on the boolean value from the item in the ArrayCollection. But if the first row's RadioButton is the one that needs to be selected, it isn't. I set up a listener for the valueCommit event on the RadioButtons, and the results are interesting: valueCommit for the RadioButtons in all rows besides the first is fired just once, with the selected value being true. But if the RadioButton in the first row is the one that should be selected, valueCommit is fired <strong>5 times</strong>, the first 3 times reporting the selected value as true and last 2 times reporting it as false.</p>\n\n<p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

So 4 times reporting the first RadioButton, with the last time being false, and fifth time reporting index 2 as false.

Basically, this is what I want to happen: 1) Get list of the users friends 2) Display them in any kind of container.  I go to look at the  graph API documentation, but that doesn't really help me given the fact that I am a visual learner.  To get that basic functions of the Mobile Application, I followed tutorials that left me at a cliff hanger as far as implementing other more complex features into the Application.  I will list the links to the Mobile a Application here: <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/flexdoc/2011/10/create-a-mobile-facebook-flex-application-in-flash-builder-4-5-part-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/flexdoc/2011/10/create-a-mobile-facebook-flex-application-in-flash-builder-4-5-part-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Part 2</a>. Those tutorials helped me a lot.  But when they were over and I had to start implementing features my self, I was kind of left at a standstill.  I've been searching and searching for how to do this, but could not really find anything that helped since they were all for Desktop Applications.  I've also looked at the sample code that the Facebook API supplies for reference.  But none is for flex Mobile, and it also seems that you'd have to write your code exactly like theirs to get those features to work properly.  Alright. So once again, I just want to be able to have a list of friends to show up.  I will worry about getting details of the friends later. I think I might be able to manage that.  Also, I am going to post all of my code because I am in no way protective of it right now. I will state one thing though. In NO way am I asking for someone to write the code for me.  I am just a very visual dependent learner.  But I think if I can get the process of implementing features explained in a more simpler manor, I would be able to take care of my own.  Which also brings up another question.  Since I am a Visual Person.  Would using flash instead of Flash Builder be more suitable for me?\nAnyways.  You don't have to answer that. Just popped up as I was writing this question.  If you have any constructive criticism on my code I'm all open.

When my application is run, <code>A</code> loads <code>B</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <code>Class</code>, <code>MyLoader</code>, in <code>MyExternalLibrary</code> that <code>B</code> uses extensively.  <code>MyExternalLibrary.MyLoader</code> loads <code>.swf</code>s that are present on our server (we don't embed them because they are loaded dynamically per user-request).  </p>\n\n<p>Note that our server contains <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and all of the <code>.swf</code>s we are going to download.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <code>A</code> must also load some of the <code>.swf</code>s on our server.  Consequentially, <code>A</code> must also use <code>MyLoader</code> in <code>MyExternalLibrary</code>.  So, In <code>A</code>, I add a reference to <code>MyLoader</code>, so that its binary is included during compilation.  I only add a reference to <code>MyLoader</code> -- I don't actually instantiate or modify it.  That is, somewhere in <code>A</code>'s code (before <code>B</code> is loaded), I have:</p>\n\n<p><code>MyLoader;</code></p>\n\n<p>I (obviously) import the <code>Class</code> as well. This ensures that <code>MyLoader</code>'s binary will be included in <code>A</code>'s <code>.swf</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Just referencing <code>MyExternalLibary.MyLoader</code> in <code>A</code> breaks <code>B</code>'s functionality with <code>MyLoader</code> -- all of the <code>.swf</code>s that <code>B</code> loads will not <code>cast</code> to its associated <code>Class</code>, despite being a <code>MovieClip</code> and having all of the proper fields.  Furthermore, in the debugger, the loaded <code>MovieClip</code>s show that they are of the correct <code>Class</code>.  For example, if I load a <code>.swf</code>, it will be a <code>MovieClip</code>; moreover, the debugger states it is of type <code>B.mySwfs.MyClass</code>, but I cannot <code>cast</code> it to <code>B.mySwfs.MyClass</code>.  I believe the culprit is <code>ApplicationDomain</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that commenting out that line of code makes everything in <code>B</code> <code>cast</code> properly.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has any idea about what's going on, I'd love some advice. I think that this issue deals with <code>ApplicationDomain</code> since <code>A</code> <em>owns</em> <code>MyExternalLibrary.MyLoader</code>, and I'm trying to <code>cast</code> a <code>MovieClip</code> loaded by <code>A</code> into a <code>Class</code> that is in <code>B</code>.  When I comment out all references to <code>MyExternalLibrary.MyLoader</code> in <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> now <em>owns</em> <code>MyExternalLibrary.MyLoader</code>, so it is able to cast to classes in <code>B</code>.

However, when I swap over the skins to the regular spark TextInputSkin, clicking on a TextInput field will work almost as expected, field does keeps focus, and the softKeyboardDeactivate does fires only when keyboard closes (usually trigger that by pressing back button), but the softKeyboardActivate event still fires twice. Why is this happening?????? I would prefer to use the StageTextInputSkin because it is better enhanced for mobile, especially for the password field I have, which only shows asterisks with the regular skin, but the mobile optimized skin shows small bitmap circles for each character and shows the last types character for a split second before converting over to small bitmap circle.

Does this code look like it would actually do the job or is it overkill?</p>\n\n<pre><code>// This is code on FMS to call a function in the applet.\n\nvar networkRetryMax = 30;\nif (something == true) doSomethingInApplet(client, 0);\n\n\nfunction doSomethingInApplet (client, retryCount) {\n    if (retryCount &lt; networkRetryMax) {\n        retryCount++;\n        client.call(\"funcNameInApplet\", new doSomethingInAppletResponder(client, retryCount), \"foobar\");\n    }\n    return;\n}\n\n\nfunction doSomethingInAppletResponder (client, retryCount) {\n    this.onResult = function() {...}\n    this.onStatus = function() {doSomethingInApplet(client, retryCount);}\n    return;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And...</p>\n\n<pre><code>// This is code in the applet.\n// I return true to give it something to onResult or onStatus.\n\npublic static function funcNameInApplet(result:String):Boolean {\n    trace(\"Result: \" + result);\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So would this ensure the function is called over UDP / RTMFP?</p>\n\n<p>Or is .call() reliability handled internally and this is unnecessary?</p>\n"},{"tags":["flex","session"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":11618713,"title":"how to continue the session from the client side using FLEX","body":"<p>I'm using FLEX for front side of my web application.
