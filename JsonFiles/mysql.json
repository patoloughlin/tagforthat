When a customer visits one of my client's websites, they do so in the form </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>www.site.com?userid=12345</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the landing page, we do a mysql lookup for information about client with userid 12345 along with a list of products he/she can sell. We only offer a suite of ~30 products and we define them so we know what they look like but not all clients can offer at the same price. The mysql table for this information looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>userid | category | itemid | price\n=================================\n12345  |    1     |  1     | 1.00\n12345  |    1     |  2     | 2.00\n12345  |    1     |  3     | 3.00\n12345  |    2     |  4     | 4.00\n12345  |    2     |  5     | 5.00\n67890  |    1     |  1     | 2.25\n67890  |    2     |  4     | 8.00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the customer visits www.site.com?userid=12345, a lookup is done with the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT category, itemid, price FROM tablename WHERE userid = 12345\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>*Note - yes I prevent sql injection.</p>\n\n<p>The issue I run into is how to build the subsequent array in PHP. My initial thought is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n...\n\nwhile ($row = $stmt-&gt;fetch()) {\n  $products[]['category'] = $row['category'];\n  $products[]['itemid'] = $row['itemid'];\n  $products[]['price'] = $row['price'];\n}\n\n\n//the array will end up looking like this:\nArray\n(\n    [0] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [category] =&gt; 1\n            [itemid] =&gt; 1\n            [price] =&gt; 1\n        )\n    [1] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [category] =&gt; 1\n            [itemid] =&gt; 2\n            [price] =&gt; 2\n        )\n    [2] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [category] =&gt; 1\n            [itemid] =&gt; 3\n            [price] =&gt; 3\n        )\n    [3] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [category] =&gt; 2\n            [itemid] =&gt; 4\n            [price] =&gt; 4\n        )\n    [4] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [category] =&gt; 2\n            [itemid] =&gt; 5\n            [price] =&gt; 5\n        )\n)\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason I need to capture information like this: On the actual site itself, there are two main categories (Food and Drinks). If a client has any products in $products with category 1, show the Food html section on the page. If a client has any products in $products with category 2, show the Drinks html section on the page.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is a predefined set of itemids available to all categories. In the case of food, there are 4:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>pepperoni</li>\n<li>sausage</li>\n<li>cheese</li>\n<li>vegetable</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If a user does not have one of these itemids, he/she cannot sell that product and that product does not appear within the Food html section. If they are able to sell that product, I want to be able to reference that section/item's price and display it next to the actual item.</p>\n\n<p>I know my $products array will contain all of the information I need but I am not sure if the way I am structuring it is best or how to really reference it when building out the page as described.</p>\n\n<p>For example (I know this code is not right but saying what I am trying to accomplish):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"If value of 1 exists in the $products category array, show the Food section.\"</li>\n<li>\"If value of 1 exists in the $products itemid category array, show Pepperoni pizza as an option on the page and display the price associated with that specific category/itemid combination.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any guidance is appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","database-design","foreign-keys","primary-key"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":55,"score":1,"question_id":13292050,"title":"Composite primary key in identifying relationship: why?","body":"<p>OK, I hope this is an appropriate question for stackoverflow as I'm trying to understand a concept rather than fixing a piece of code that won't work.</p>\n\n<p>I'll take a general example of a <strong>form</strong> (parent table) and a <strong>form field</strong> (child table). <strong>Logically</strong>, this would be an identifying relationship, since a form field cannot exist without a form.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CaC1h.png\" alt=\"form and form_field tables\"></p>\n\n<p>This would make me think that in order to translate the <strong>logical</strong> relationship into the <strong>technical</strong> relationship, a simple <code>NOT NULL</code> for the form_id field in the form_field table would suffice.

Something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/kKYEP.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>What is crucial and important here is the passing of the first <code>eta</code> to the next <code>etd</code> and the computation. How can I get it done when I'm required to loop through the exploded values? Please help me. I'm sorry for the long explanation but I want all of you to understand what I am trying to achieve.

The issue is to do with the schema so I can still order nicely in player/clan ladders but if we want to add a stat later it won't lock our table changing every row due to one stat per column. </p>\n\n<p>I see two options for how to do this but both don't seem to be right. One is one stat per column. There would be 4 tables, user_stat_summary (for basic stats shown on ladders), user_stat_beast (teams are human vs beast), user_stat_human and user_stat_overall. Stats are shown everywhere from the last 30 days. A cron job will take any dated stats by getting a query on matches that happened after the 30 days and taking away those stats from the 3 main tables and putting them into the overall one. Matches will have blobs for the stats each player got for that match. The issue I see here is when we have a lot of rows that we can't easily add more stats when say the game changes a little. What I was thinking was a extra_stats blob column on each table and if we add new stats they simply aren't going to be sortable on the ladders. </p>\n\n<p>The other option is an EAV model which is what I have been playing around with but can't seem to get it right. I would be getting many more rows per query and then grouping them into users and the order would work for the most part but I couldn't get limits right for pagination since there was generally an unknown number of rows selected. </p>\n\n<p>What I was thinking is the EAV model with a table that stores ranks per stats which could be used for ordering. So the EAV tables are currently as follows...</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `user_stat` (\n    `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n    `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n    `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n    PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n    CONSTRAINT `user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_human_stat` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n     `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `human_user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_beast_stat` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `stat_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n     `value` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`stat_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `beast_user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n\nCREATE TABLE `user_stat_overall` (\n     `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n     `human` blob NOT NULL,\n     `beast` blob NOT NULL,\n     `total` blob NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`),\n     CONSTRAINT `user_overall` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `xf_user` (`user_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I was thinking I could add a user_stat_rank table which would be user_id, stat_id, rank. Then say I want to get the first page of the ladder ordered by the 'kills' stat I could get all the user_ids order by rank where stat_id is kills. Then make a second query to populate all the users stats. </p>\n\n<p>After writing all this out it seems like it would work fine but I might not be seeing something.

I access the server from my laptop with SSH, and I can call family members to mess with router settings and such.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to use a MySQL database on a Ubuntu Server machine that I access remotely from a Windows 7 laptop. I have installed MySQL Connector C++ from the MySQL website (the msi installer). NOTE: I have not done anything with the Connector install except run the exe I downloaded. Didn't think I needed to compile anything, but I'm wrong a lot. I have created a database, a user who has privileges to the database, and this user can (in theory) connect from any ip, because it is declared as 'username@'%'. I also changed the my.cnf file so that the bind-address line is commented out. I used 'mysqladmin ping -h serveraddress -u username -p' and that gave me 'mysqld is alive', so I'm assuming the database is accessible from any ip remotely. So, I opened up VS 2010 Pro, made a new project, went to tools, and then 'Connect To Database'. I selected Microsoft MySQL Server and put in the information exactly as I did for mysqladmin. I clicked Test Connection and I get an error box that ends with 'provider: Named Pipes Provider, error 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server'. Sorry for the block of text, just want to give all the details I can.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully I'm close to making this work, I'm not pressed for time but I'm really tired of not being able to work on anything else in the project, since it all branches from this database connection.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks you all! I'll reply with whatever you need me to during the day, I'm not much of a night owl anymore =)</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nI have the sample code from the mysql site compiling correctly, it was just a matter of finally getting a few hours to sit down and fix linker/library errors one at a time, downloaded the boost libraries, and changed include directories to direct paths when I could get them to work correctly.

I've bought a book to teach myself PHP / MySQL - and not one which is universally praised, unfortunately - so my progress is a bit erratic. </p>\n\n<p>I have two tables which I want to link. I want to display all of the information held in table 1 (let's call it Records), but ONLY once.

Any suggestions on what I could put there to get a count of all of the existing customers vs the new customers?</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT\n  YEAR(so.date_entered),\n  so.technical_address_country,\n  so.technical_address_state,\n  COUNT(so.id) as all_sales,\n  COUNT(mf.id) as all_jobs,\n  SUM(so.total_value) as all_value,\n    COUNT(IF(so.check_if_new_customer=1,so.id,0)) as sales_order_new,\n  SUM(IF(so.check_if_new_customer = 1,so.total_value,0)) as total_value_new,\n    COUNT(IF(so.check_if_new_customer=1,mf.id,0)) as jobs_new,\n    COUNT(IF(so.check_if_new_customer=0,so.id,0)) as sales_order_existing,\n  SUM(IF(so.check_if_new_customer = 0,so.total_value,0)) as total_value_existing,\n    COUNT(IF(so.check_if_new_customer=0,mf.id,0)) as jobs_existing,\n    SUM(IF(so.check_if_new_customer=0,mf.id,0)) as jobs_existing_t\nFROM \n  sugarcrm2.so_order so \nLEFT JOIN \n  sugarcrm2.mf_job mf on so.id = mf.sales_order_id \nWHERE \n  so.date_entered &gt; \"2011-10-30\" AND \n    so.technical_address_country IS NOT NULL AND  \n  so.technical_address_state IS NOT NULL AND \n  so.deleted = 0 AND \n  so.has_been_promoted = 1 \nGROUP BY \n    YEAR(so.date_entered),\n  so.technical_address_country, \n  so.technical_address_state\nORDER BY \n  so.technical_address_country, so.technical_address_state \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","mysql-error-1005"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":180,"score":1,"question_id":9986287,"title":"Cannot create table with underscore in table name MySQL v5.5.14","body":"<p>I'm using Mysql v5.5.14 and when I try to execute:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LONGBOW_products.universal_partname (\n    -&gt;    part_id SMALLINT(5) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\n    -&gt;    PRIMARY KEY (part_id)\n    -&gt; );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is returning me an error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can't create table 'LONGBOW_products.universal_partname' (errno: -1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I tried removing the underscore from the table name, it returns true:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LONGBOW_products.universal (\n    -&gt;    part_id SMALLINT(5) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\n    -&gt;    PRIMARY KEY (`part_id`)\n    -&gt; );\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wonder if you cannot use underscores anymore in table name on newer versions of Mysql?</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","forms","date","select"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":35,"score":0,"question_id":13277980,"title":"Match MySQL Time in PHP","body":"<p>This seems like a simple task, and I've seen others ask the same question, but I still can't return any results from my SQL query.

Shouldn't it be thrown as soon as the recursive function is called? And not entering the recursive function and calling <strong>updateIfNecessary()</strong>. I mean to say that if there was no memory, the recursive function itself should not have been called. \n<br><br>\n<strong>EDIT#2</strong><br>\nAs per @prajeeshkumar's suggestion, I set the stack size to -<code>Xss128m</code>(1024, 512 and 256 were giving a fatal error) for stack size in run configurations. <br>\nCurrently the recursion number or the depth is <strong><code>7,500,000</code> and counting</strong>(value of <code>System.out.println(k++);</code>).\n<br> The total number of combinations possible is \n<br></p>\n\n<pre><code>16!/(16-5)! = 524160\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br>\nBut the depth has already reached 7,500,000. This is because of generation of duplicate states. Currently the number of entries in the database is <strong>513423</strong>. You might think that there only 10,000 entries to fill up now. But now the rate at which entries are made has decreased drastically about <strong>1 entry every 30 min</strong>.

I looked through other topics since there are some topics here involving custom session handler but no one of them answered my question. \nI use a custom session handler in a class called \"sessions\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>require_once \"mySQL.php\";\n\nclass sessions {\nprivate $db;\npublic function __construct(){\n    $this-&gt;db=new mySQL('localhost', user, pw, database);\n    session_set_save_handler(array(&amp;$this,\"open\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"close\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"read\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"write\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"destroy\"),\n                     array(&amp;$this,\"gc\"));\n    register_shutdown_function('session_write_close');\n    session_start();\n} \npublic function read($sessionID){\n    $abfrage=\"SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE id='\".$sessionID.\"'\";\n    $result= $this-&gt;db-&gt;query($abfrage);\n    if ($result == false){\n        return '';\n    }\n    if (count($result) &gt; 0){\n        return $result[0][\"value\"];\n    }\n    else{ \n    return '';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In \"mySQL.php\" there is just a class \"mySQL\" written which creates a mysqli connection to the database. This is working and not the problem. I would like to draw the focus to the \"read\" routine because this seems to be the primary problem. If i now create a session via</p>\n\n<pre><code>require_once \"classes/sessions.php\";\n$SESSION=new sessions();\n$token=hash(\"sha256\",session_id().time());\n$_SESSION['token']=$token;\n$_SESSION['running']=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and write values into the session the right database value is created:</p>\n\n<pre><code>id (varchar 64) = 54ul84nhc3aimqc55efcs49js4\nlastUpdated (int 11) = 1352226239\nstart (int 11) = 1352226233\nvalue (varchar 20000) =     token|s:64:\"2b92aa848a86741ef11d800c3dce527fdcee264f50de10381941241c3d9cc9ee\";running|i:1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and even the garbage collector works fine but when i reload the page and try to echo </p>\n\n<pre><code>$_SESSION['running']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i get the error \"Notice:Undefined index: running\". A debugger run informed that the above posted read routine returns 1 (which would be equal to the boolean \"true\"?!) instead of the value. I checked that the \"sessionID\" in the read routine for that case was the one in the session table, so i'm basically lost. It would be very nice if you can help me, because so far i'm already impressed of the possibilities offered by such custom session handler.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it's possible to pose also a side question here. Is it right that when i reload the page the constructor of sessions is called by \"$SESSION=new sessions();\" even when there is already a session running (however this behaviour does not change the session_id)? Or is this due to my broken session read routine?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your help.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I'm using PHP/5.4.4 and MySQL 5.5.25a in a xampp distribution along with phpmyAdmin 3.5.2 to set up the database.

It's a classic one and we know the naive approach (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/580639/how-to-randomly-select-rows-in-sql\">also on SO</a>) is usually something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>\n\n<p>We also know a query like that is utterly inefficient and actually usable only with very few rows. There are some approaches that could be taken to attain better efficiency, like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/211329/quick-selection-of-a-random-row-from-a-large-table-in-mysql\">these ones</a> still on SO, but they won't work with arbitrary primary keys and the <em>randomness</em> will be skewed as soon as you have holes in your numeric primary keys. An answer to the last cited question links to <a href=\"http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/mysql/order-by-rand/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> which has a good explanation and some bright solutions involving an additional \"equal distribution\" table that must be maintained whenever the \"master data\" table changes. But then again if you have frequent DELETEs on a big table you'll probably be screwed up by the constant updating of the added table. Also note that many solutions rely on <code>COUNT(*)</code> which is ridiculously fast on MyISAM but \"just fast\" on InnoDB (I don't know how it performs on other platforms but I suspect the InnoDB case could be representative of other transactional database systems).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that, even the best solutions I was able to find are fast but not <em>Ludicrous Speed</em> fast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE IDEA</strong></p>\n\n<p>A separate service could be responsible to generate, buffer and distribute random row ids or even entire random rows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it could choose the best method to extract random row ids depending on how the original PKs are structured. An ordered list of keys could be maintained in ram by the service (shouldn't take too many bytes per row in addition to the actual size of the PK, it's probably ok up to 100~1000M rows with standard PCs and up to 1~10 billion rows with a beefy server)</li>\n<li>once the keys are in memory you have an implicit \"row number\" for each key and no holes in it so it's just a matter of choosing a random number and directly fetch the corresponding key</li>\n<li>a buffer of random keys ready to be consumed could be maintained to quickly respond to spikes in the incoming requests</li>\n<li>consumers of the service will connect and request N random rows from the buffer</li>\n<li>rows are returned as simple keys <em>or</em> the service could maintain a (pool of) db connection(s) to fetch entire rows</li>\n<li>if the buffer is empty the request could block or return EOF-like</li>\n<li>if data is added to the master table the service must be signaled to add the same data to its copy too, flush the buffer of random picks and go on from that</li>\n<li>if data is deleted from the master table the service must be signaled to remove that data too from both the \"all keys\" list and \"random picks\" buffer</li>\n<li>if data is updated in the master table the service must be signaled to update corresponding rows in the key list and in the random picks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>WHY WE THINK IT'S COOL</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>does not touch disks other than the initial load of keys at startup or when signaled to do so</li>\n<li>works with any kind of primary key, numerical or not</li>\n<li>if you know you're going to update a large batch of data you can just signal it when you're done (i.e. not at every single insert/update/delete on the original data), it's basically like having a fine grained lock that only blocks requests for random rows</li>\n<li>really fast on updates of any kind in the original data</li>\n<li>offloads some work from the relational db to another, memory only process: helps scalability</li>\n<li>responds really fast from its buffers without waiting for any querying, scanning, sorting</li>\n<li>could easily be extended to similar use cases beyond the SQL one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>WHY WE THINK IT COULD BE A STUPID IDEA</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>because <em>we</em> had the idea without help from any third party</li>\n<li>because nobody (we heard of) has ever bothered to do something similar</li>\n<li>because it adds complexity in the mix to keep it updated whenever original data changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>AND THE QUESTION IS...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Does anything similar already exists?

I'm currently evaluating the possibilty to transparently add multitenancy functionality to the data layer (mysql). The Problem now is, that I want to separate some tables/entities and to share some. Because my tenants would like to share some information and to use features like global user management for example. I'm leaning towards to a solution where I have a master database with all tables and a database for each tenanat which contains the same data, but in form of either a table or a view. A table represents private data and a view to the master database represents shared data. During development I can make the decision to wheter make the data shared or private by creating a view or a table. The tenants application always connects to it's own database, because the database is always complete (consisting of tables and views).</p>\n\n<p>I want the dbms to do the heavy lifting of <strong>ACID</strong> and abstraction.

Is there any easy way I can get this system to use MySQL instead, or will I have to create my own authentication? </p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":45,"score":0,"question_id":13247257,"title":"storing time to a db and comparing with current time","body":"<p>i have a simple question, that just needs verification, it's about how time is stored in mysql, here is how i store it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  if(isset($_SESSION['user']))\n{\n$u_id=$_SESSION['user'];\n//insert current time to db, i set the type of time to TIME \n$query=\"INSERT INTO time(id,u_id,time) VALUES('NULL','\".$u_id.\"',CURTIME())\";\nmysql_query($query);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that is how i store it, now i would also need to compare it to a value, later on:</p>\n\n<pre><code> //set current time\n$curr_time=time();\n//set maximum time to 5min\n$max=300; \n//get previous time from db\n$query=\"SELECT * FROM time\";\n$result=mysql_query($query);\n$row=mysql_fetch_array($result); \n$prev_time=$row['time'];\n//get difference in time\n$diff=$curr_time-$prev_time;\n//if max time is surpassed\nif($diff&gt;$max)\n{\n  echo \"maximum time surpassed!\";\n\n    }  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that's the simple code, first of all, is the syntax for inserting the time to the table okay(the CURTIME() thing), also is the comparison fine, will the result stored in $diff yield seconds?thank you, and sorry if you think this question is a waste of time.  </p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","triggers"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":22,"score":0,"question_id":13134871,"title":"Fetching data from another table not working mysql trigger","body":"<p>I have a trigger like this</p>\n\n<pre><code> CREATE\n TRIGGER `hrm_to_odm_user` AFTER INSERT\n ON `ohrm_user`\n FOR EACH ROW BEGIN\n  DECLARE _dep_id INTEGER;\n        SELECT eeo_cat_code INTO _dep_id FROM hs_hr_employee WHERE emp_number = NEW.id;\n  INSERT INTO zodm_user (id, username, password, department) VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.user_name, NEW.user_password, _dep_id);\n    END\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After inserting data to ohrm_user i fire the trigger to insert values to zodm_user</p>\n\n<p>It works fine for everything else other than this field _dep_id which i select from another table named hs_hr_employee</p>\n\n<p>I have gone thru this post </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6048549/mysql-trigger-update-with-select-from-another-table\">MySQL Trigger Update with select from another table</a></p>\n\n<p>but it is not working for me</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","blob","tcl"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":33,"score":0,"question_id":13245589,"title":"BLOB with TCL SCRIPTING","body":"<p>I want to upload the data in BLOB datatype in MySQL database by the help of TCL SCRIPTING \n What are the ways to do that ...I have been trying hard from last 4-5 days by converting text data into binary format by using <code>binary format formatString ?arg arg ...?</code> of TCL,but still it does not getting reflected on mysql database.... ,database fields have been keep coming blank.Please Correct me if I am wrong....&amp; tell me the correct procedure.</p>\n\n<p>I am using INNODB engine of mysql</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":0,"question_id":13246326,"title":"sql query in where condition","body":"<p>Is it good if i write query like this:- (see query in where condition)</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT distinct(id) \"idea_id\" \nFROM ideas \nWHERE deleted_by_user = 0 AND moderation_flag = 1 AND \nuser_id in (select id \n            from users \n            where confirm like \"yes\") \nORDER BY time_of_creation DESC\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>let me know if there is some issue in this query :\nthanx in advance..</p>\n"}]}

I am sure there is quite a large difference between working with these two databases, so any point of reference – suggestions of tutorials to follow or documentation to read – would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","phpmyadmin","joomla1.5"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":45,"score":-2,"question_id":13220351,"title":"Mysql Query to fetch records","body":"<p>I have a table structure which looks like as follows<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xmt3U.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In the above table I need the <code>team_id</code> for which <code>win+runs_scored</code> is <em>maximum</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I know that task can be accomplished by PHP code but if there is any query possible for this then it would be easier for me and also main thing is that in real table contains more then <em>15000 rows</em> so please if some can can provide me a better solution then it would be great</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","ios"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":19,"score":1,"question_id":13244247,"title":"Static cells with an array","body":"<p>I'm using xml to export mysql information to ios, and that saves it in an array.

As I understand and can see, MySQL can use an index both for range scan and order by only, if it is the last part in a compound index.

When I searched for fast indexing, I came across Sphinx, solr, lucene... but also as far as I understood they are all not exactly easy to implement and use and secondly are mostly mentioned for fulltext search, which is nice, but not such a high priority right now...</p>\n\n<p>Can anybody address that specific issue with MySQL using index on range, multiple range, range and order by? And secondly, whether sphinx etc could help in that case or not? A big disadvantage that I found is the re-indexing necessary with sphinx, is that correct?

How can I migrate?\"</a> does not in fact answer why it is discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>This is a problem for developers using libraries that still rely on the old mysql extension.

I've made a small test-case project with different model-names to find a proper solution for my problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Don't mix the <strong>databases</strong> up with <strong>tables</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: I separated the user-data into multiple <strong>databases</strong> for legal &amp; performance issues.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm working on a <strong>CakePHP</strong> project that has multiple <code>User</code>'s and each <code>User</code> has it's own <strong>database</strong> with multiple <strong>tables</strong> (<code>cars</code> is one of the <strong>tables</strong>). Now, I need to explain something first:</p>\n\n<p>Every <code>User</code> has his own <strong>database</strong> (not a table, a <strong>database</strong>), so the database names are as follows.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[DATABASE] <code>app</code> (This is the app's main database)\n<ul>\n<li>[TABLE] <code>users</code> </li>\n<li>[TABLE] <code>permissions</code> (<em>Not relevant for this question</em>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>[DATABASE] <code>app_user1</code> (<code>User.id</code> 1 owns this entire <strong>database</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>[TABLE] <code>cars</code> (a <strong>table</strong> entirely owned by <code>User.id</code> 1)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>[DATABASE] <code>app_user2</code> (<code>User.id</code> 2 owns this entire <strong>database</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>[TABLE] <code>cars</code> (a <strong>table</strong> entirely owned by <code>User.id</code> 2)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>etc...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I made a small drawing which might clarify the <strong>database</strong> / <strong>table</strong> -definitions and their relations to the models:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zU6Db.png\" alt=\"How to use multiple databases dynamically for one model in CakePHP\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't know which <strong>database</strong> to connect to until the <code>User</code> logs in. <code>User</code>'s and their <strong>databases</strong> are created dynamically, so I cant use <code>app/Config/database.php</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm currently writing an extension on the <code>Model</code> and <code>ConnectionManager</code> classes to bypass CakePHP's basic database behaviors. So the <code>Car</code> model knows which <strong>database</strong> to use.

For me it says nothing of providing a zip code - it says \"Please choose a country below to calculate your delivery costs\" (as it should) then there is a dropdown with no options in it to select.

That is known. But How can I make sure that <code>SELECT</code> returns the row containing a specific IP, in case this IP exists in this group?

Therefore I use Count().</p>\n\n<p><strong>WORKAROUND:</strong> Since it seems to be pretty complicated to do what I need (if possible at all), I'm now working with a workaround. I'm using the GROUP_CONCAT() aggregate function. This delivers me all IPs of that group separated by \",\". So I can search whether the one I'm searching for already exists there. The only drawback of this is, that the (default) maximum lenght of this returned string is 1024. That means that I can't handle a big amount of users, but for now it should be fine.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","phpmyadmin"],"answer_count":6,"favorite_count":2,"up_vote_count":21,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":36508,"score":21,"question_id":459312,"title":"Setting up foreign keys in phpMyAdmin?","body":"<p>I'm setting up a database using phpMyAdmin.

My first goal is to integrate the <a href=\"http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/obauth-simple-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow\">obAuth component</a> (or any other secure authentification plugin for CakePHP) with an ExtJS 3 login interface. I am searching for the best method of combining these too so that I can easily restrict functions based on the usergroup access. I am thinking of a setup where the logged in user makes one post from Ext regarding the execution of a function and the CakePHP response made present as errors or notifiers through Ext alert boxes.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think this is possible ? Any thoughts of an ideal config for this ?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","postgresql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":35,"score":-1,"question_id":13206691,"title":"SQL Update latest column in master table from transaction table","body":"<p>I have two tables </p>\n\n<pre><code>customer_master\n&gt; cname\n&gt; lastreceiptdate\n&gt; lastreceiptamt\n\naccounts\n&gt; cname\n&gt; date\n&gt; amount\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I need help in constructing a single update query. where the <code>customer_master</code> table is updated with the latest receipt date and receipt amount for a single customer code (cname like \"FRUITXXXXX\") from accounts table.</p>\n\n<p>It should work in mysql 5.0 and postgresql 9.0</p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n\n<p>so far we are using a select command to retrieve a record with max(Date) and then using another update command to update using results from the select query.</p>\n\n<pre><code>update customer_master \nset receiptdate = @_da, receiptamt=@_amt \nwhere cname = @_cn and (receiptdate &lt; @_da or receiptdate='null') \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["php","mysql","get"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"view_count":36,"score":0,"question_id":13207184,"title":"How to dynamically generate a webpage with PHP MySQL according to link clicked","body":"<p>I previously asked this question but need more help. Read this, then I will provide exact details at the end.</p>\n\n<p>I have successfully transformed the static website I built for my podcast (www.noformatpodcast.com) into a dynamic website in Dreamweaver (on a testing server for now). I have done this without having to learn PHP or MySQL really at all by using the \"Database\", \"Bindings\" and \"Server Behaviors\" tabs in Dreamweaver. THE ONLY THING I AM NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT is how to get a page to generate dynamically when some one clicks a link using information about that link to create the page. For example, I have a grid of dynamically generated episodes on the index.php page. When someone clicks the link for, say, episode 55, I want it to load the episode page (which I have already created) and fill in the information from episode 55 such as date, title, blurb etc. If someone clicks the link for episode 43, I want THE SAME page to load and dynamically populate the the page with the info from episode 43. Is this possible to do with Dreamweaver's GUI, or do I need to grow up and learn to actually code?</p>\n\n<p>The answers I got both told me I need to learn how to use $_GET. I've reviewed the basics of it at w3schools.com but still need a lot of help. Here is my dynamic repeating block of code that makes the grid of episodes on my index.php page</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"post_container\"&gt;\n    &lt;?php do { ?&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"post\"&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"episode.php\" onmouseout=\"this.style.opacity=1;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.opacity=0.7;\"&gt;\n                &lt;h2&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=\"darkblock\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['post_id']; ?&gt; | &lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['ep_title']; ?&gt;\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/h2&gt;\n                &lt;img src=\"ep_artwork/ep_&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['post_id']; ?&gt;.jpg\"  width=\"260\" height=\"260\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;?php } while ($row_Episodes = mysql_fetch_assoc($Episodes)); ?&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So basically I have a bunch of big square images that are links to the episode.php page. I have coded the episode.php page to display data dynamically as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"summary\"&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"artwork\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"ep_&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['post_id']; ?&gt;.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"ep_title\"&gt;Ep. &lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['post_id']; ?&gt; | &lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['ep_title']; ?&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"episode_date\"&gt;&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['ep_date']; ?&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['ep_blurb']; ?&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"ep_media/ep_&lt;?php echo $row_Episodes['post_id']; ?&gt;.m4a\" controls=\"controls\"&gt;\n&lt;/audio&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I lack is the code to glue these two things together. I mean, as it stands now, if you click on any episode, it just takes you to the episode.php page and displays the info of the first episode (cause it's the first in the database). I need to make it show the info OF THE EPISODE CLICKED. And I guess that involves using $_GET. Could someone show me EXACTLY what code I need to include, and where to include it? Is what I've posted here enough? Or do you need to know more info about my MySQL database as well?</p>\n"},{"tags":["c#","mysql","sql-server","ado.net"],"answer_count":3,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":9573,"score":2,"question_id":1631054,"title":"Using SqlDataAdapter to insert a row","body":"<p>I want to insert a row into the Database using SqlDataAdapter.

In C#, I write a query like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var culverCustomers = from cs in db.CustomerSummaries where cs.Street == \"Culver\";\n// later...\nvar sortedCustomers = culverCustomers.OrderBy(cs =&gt; cs.Name).ToList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of generating simple a query like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT cust.id FROM customer_summary cust WHERE cust.street = \"Culver\" ORDER BY cust.name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The entity framework generates a query with a derived table like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT Project1.id FROM (\n    SELECT cust.id, cust.name, cust.street FROM customer_summary cust\n    WHERE Project1.street = \"Culver\"\n) AS Project1 -- here is where the EF generates a pointless derived table\nORDER BY Project1.name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I explain both queries I get this for the first query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>id, select_type, table, type, possible_keys, rows\n1,  PRIMARY,     addr,  ALL,  PRIMARY,       9\n1,  PRIMARY,     cust,  ref,  PRIMARY,       4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and something awful like this for the entity framework query</p>\n\n<pre><code>id, select_type, table,      type, possible_keys, rows\n1,  PRIMARY,     &lt;derived2&gt;, ALL,                 9639 *** WTF!!!\n2,  DERIVED,     addr,       ALL,  PRIMARY,       9\n2,  DERIVED,     cust,       ref,  PRIMARY,       4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the first row, where MySQL explains that it's scanning <strong>9000+ records</strong>.

We could have multiple products of the same type (eg. For different plans of a given product type). For example, we have the following products:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shared WebHosting Plan One</li>\n<li>Shared WebHosting Plan Two</li>\n<li>Shared WebHosting Plan Three</li>\n<li>Dedicated Server Plan</li>\n<li>Virtual Dedicated Server Plan One</li>\n<li>Virtual Dedicated Server Plan Two</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Right now the issue I have is that, we have a number of fields which are common to any given service, but we also have a number of fields which change, depending on the \"type\" of service being tracked. Depending on the type of the service, I will display the base form for all services, but also the appropriate form for adding/editing etc... </p>\n\n<p>For example, we have the following service types, and each product (as shown above) would relate to one of these core service types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shared Web Hosting</li>\n<li>Dedicated Hosting</li>\n<li>Virtual Dedicated Hosting</li>\n<li>ADSL</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>My Possible Solutions</h1>\n\n<h2>Current Solution - Multiple Tables</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, in my database, I have:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ServiceTypes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceTypeID INT PK</li>\n<li>Type VARCHAR(40)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Product</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ProductID INT PK</li>\n<li>Name VARCHAR(40)</li>\n<li>Description TEXT</li>\n<li>Price DECIMAL</li>\n<li>BillingDuration INT</li>\n<li>TypeID INT (FK ServiceTypes.ServiceTypeID)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Service</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceID INT PK</li>\n<li>ProductID INT (FK: Product.ProductID)</li>\n<li>Name VARCHAR(40)</li>\n<li>Description TEXT</li>\n<li>Price DECIMAL</li>\n<li>BillingDuration INT</li>\n<li>Active BIT</li>\n<li>StartDate DATETIME</li>\n<li>EndDate DATETIME</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those are the main tables for any service, then I've got additional tables for the extended properties:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ServiceADSLInfo</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceADSLInfoID INT PK</li>\n<li>ServiceID INT (FK: Service.ServiceID)</li>\n<li>FNN VARCHAR(10)</li>\n<li>Username VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>Password VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>LocationID INT (FK: Locations.LocationID)</li>\n<li>ModemAssetID INT (FK: Assets.AssetID)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>ServiceVirtualServerInfo</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceVirtualServerInfo INT PK</li>\n<li>ServiceID INT (FK: Service.ServiceID)</li>\n<li>ServerName VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>IPAddress INT (FK: IPAddresses.AddressID)</li>\n<li>HostServer INT (FK: Assets.AssetID)</li>\n<li>Username VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>Password VARCHAR(20)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>ServiceSharedHostingInfo</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceSharedHostingInfoID INT PK</li>\n<li>ServiceID INT (FK: Service.ServiceID)</li>\n<li>Hostname VARCHAR(50)</li>\n<li>HostServer INT (FK: Assets.AssetID)</li>\n<li>DiskSpaceQuota INT</li>\n<li>BandwidthQuota INT</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Other Solution - Single Table</h2>\n\n<p>I'm thinking of storing all service related information in a single table, regardless of the type of service, and just have the values be NULL if they're not needed for that particular service.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ServiceID INT PK</li>\n<li>ProductID INT (FK: Product.ProductID)</li>\n<li>Name VARCHAR(40)</li>\n<li>Description TEXT</li>\n<li>Price DECIMAL</li>\n<li>BillingDuration INT</li>\n<li>Active BIT</li>\n<li>StartDate DATETIME</li>\n<li>EndDate DATETIME</li>\n<li>Username VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>Password VARCHAR(20)</li>\n<li>FNN VARCHAR(10)</li>\n<li>LocationID INT (FK: Locations.LocationID)</li>\n<li>AssetID INT (FK: Assets.AssetID)</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I feel like this might be an easier solution to work with in terms of searching as well, since in order to service any service related data, I can just use a full text search on the single table, and not worry about joining records together.</p>\n\n<p>My main concern here would be that I end up with a table that has 30+ columns, which seems like it could get pretty messy. The other thing is that it doesn't solve both my concerns, because I would still need to have the core serviceTypes table to figure out which fields I need to use for any given search - and hence still have some overlap with my products table.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if some degree of overlap with the products table is impossible to avoid?</p>\n\n<h2>Entity-Attribute-Value model</h2>\n\n<p>I've considered this design as well. Overall, I feel like this is overkill for me as I don't need things to be <em>that</em> flexible and dynamic. We will need a set group of fields depending on the service type, but the data we need to collect on each core service type I can't see changing any time soon, so this can be static.</p>\n\n<p>It also seems to me that the application logic needed to implement this level of flexibility would be far too complicated for the benefits it brings.</p>\n\n<p>Having to determine the type of HTML form field to display depending on the type of the field queried from the database etc... Just sounds painful.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if there are any further details I can provide! I hope everything is clear.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","sql"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":53,"score":3,"question_id":13191878,"title":"Why recursive query faster than join and group by?","body":"<p>I am using MySQL server 5.5 and have next db structure</p>\n\n<pre><code>    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    -- Table `mydb`.`User`\n    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mydb`.`User` (\n      `id` INT NOT NULL ,\n      `Name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL ,\n      PRIMARY KEY (`id`) )\n    ENGINE = InnoDB;\n\n\n    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    -- Table `mydb`.`Payments`\n    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mydb`.`Payments` (\n      `id` INT NOT NULL ,\n      `Amount` DOUBLE NOT NULL ,\n      `User` INT NOT NULL ,\n      PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ,\n      INDEX `fk_Payments_User` (`User` ASC) ,\n      CONSTRAINT `fk_Payments_User`\n        FOREIGN KEY (`User` )\n        REFERENCES `mydb`.`User` (`id` )\n        ON DELETE NO ACTION\n        ON UPDATE NO ACTION)\n    ENGINE = InnoDB;\n\n\n    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    -- Table `mydb`.`Extras`\n    -- -----------------------------------------------------\n    CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mydb`.`Extras` (\n      `id` INT NOT NULL ,\n      `ExtraAmount` DOUBLE NOT NULL ,\n      PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ,\n      INDEX `fk_Extras_Payments1` (`id` ASC) ,\n      CONSTRAINT `fk_Extras_Payments1`\n        FOREIGN KEY (`id` )\n        REFERENCES `mydb`.`Payments` (`id` )\n        ON DELETE NO ACTION\n        ON UPDATE NO ACTION)\n    ENGINE = InnoDB;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And question is: Why this query </p>\n\n<pre><code>    SELECT u.*, sum(`amount`),sum(`ExtraAmount`)\n    FROM `user` AS `u`\n    LEFT JOIN payments AS p ON u.id = p.`user`\n    INNER JOIN extras AS e ON p.id = e.id\n    WHERE `Name` = 'abc'\n    GROUP BY `Name`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>works slower than this one</p>\n\n<pre><code>    SELECT *, IFNULL((SELECT sum(`amount`)\n                      FROM payments AS p\n                      WHERE u.id = p.`user`),0) AS `TotalAmount`,\n              IFNULL((SELECT sum(`ExtraAmount`)\n                      FROM payments AS p\n                      INNER JOIN extras AS e ON p.id = e.id\n                      WHERE p.`User` = u.id),0) AS `sum2`\n    FROM `user` AS `u`\n    WHERE `Name` = 'abc'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is difference even on empty DB(0.0001-0002s, not much, but still).

I'm trying to make the system scalable from the start so I'm considering the fairly new idea of storing each user's data (essentially lists of files they have stored) in separate SQLite databases stored in a user-specific directory, rather than one huge table in MySQL with user IDs. The file list will store other metadata related to the file so just using the filesystem isn't an option.</p>\n\n<p>My thought there is that when users are logged in and viewing their files it will be faster to just show all data in a single SQLite database rather than have MySQL go over all records in the \"file\" table to pull out one user's file by ID. Each user will easily have 10,000+ entries and there will initially be at least 400 users. So 400 individual SQLite databases with 10,000 rows, or a single MySQL table with 4 million? Keeping in mind that all 400 users will rarely (if ever) be logged in at the same time it seems inefficient to have the database have to deal with data for users that aren't there, even if it is indexed.</p>\n\n<p>The single biggest restriction of SQLite is the locking but luckily in this case there will only ever be a single process writing to the database so that shouldn't be a problem here. The added administration of backing up the individual SQLite databases is trivial since they're all going to be part of the incremental filesystem backup anyway. </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? Opinions?

Can anyone guide me?</p>\n"}]}

(Just in case that's not your cup of tea).</p>\n\n<p>A site I'm developing (PHP/MySQL) will contain an element which is essentially user created forms. One user creates a form, specifying field info (maximum of 10 fields) and others can submit the forms. So one table will be a \"key\" for the form containing fields such as: </p>\n\n<pre><code>form_id\nfield_1_name\nfield_1_description\nfield_1_weight\nfield_2_name\nfield_2_description .... etc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The other table will contain rows of entries/submissions to the form. </p>\n\n<pre><code>user_id\nform_id\nfield_1\nfield_2 .... etc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, I need to incorporate a functionality for the user (form creator) to modify the form and delete a field. Note that field order IS important, and absent fields (if the form has less than 10) are always stored at the end of the table (e.g. field_10). So, in order to do this, if a field in the key table gets deleted, all the existing entries for that form will need to have the subsequent fields shifted left. </p>\n\n<p>Such that... if the first form field gets deleted, field_2_name becomes field_1_name, field_3_name becomes field_2_name .... field_10_name becomes NULL. Then the same needs to happen for EVERY form submission. </p>\n\n<p>The only way I can think to do this is one at a time. But if a form entry collection ever makes it to the 5 or 6 digit category... I can see this process causing a noticeable delay/problems. I'm still fairly new to SQL, but the only way I can think to do this is to return the entire record set (by form_id) to the application layer, perform the shifts, and update the rows one at a time. More problematic since the action is user-initiated and that delay will be reflected to the user performing the action.</p>\n\n<p>Is this going to be a big problem or can anyone tell me approximately how long it will take MySQL to update 10 fields (floats) in say.. 50,000 records?

There is a function that checks if an instance of the cron is running to disallow parallel running of the script.

I don’t understand why there is such a performance-difference between the same query! I checked the mysql-processlist while the cron-copy-statement was running – there are no other queries which lock tables or something. There’s just the single copy-query in the processlist – and a “sending data” with more than 2.500 seconds. There is no other cron or any other tasks which influence the performance of the server running.

I think that's going to cause massive problems further down the line, plus it seems like a very roundabout way of doing things? (correct me if that's in fact the simplest way! But I would like to find another, preferably only using sql not updating any values in the db)</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if it would be possible to somehow manipulate the output of the sql depending on the <code>force_to_top</code> property?</p>\n\n<p>For example if we have the following structure</p>\n\n<pre><code>        Cars\n        |\n-----------------\n|       |       |\nAudi    Ford    VW\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which would have the following lft/rgt/force_to_top values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>node    lft    rgt  force_to_top\nCars    1      8    false\nAudi    2      3    false\nFord    4      5    false\nVW      6      7    false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When we output the child nodes of 'Cars', we'd be given:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Audi\nFord\nVW\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But lets say the node 'VW' has its <code>force_to_top</code> property set to <code>true</code>, what I would really need is the output of the child nodes of 'Cars' to now be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>VW\nAudi\nFord\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I mentioned I've thought about storing the original <code>lft</code> and <code>rgt</code> values and resetting them after the <code>force_to_top</code> property is removed. The plus side of not doing it this way is the speed of turning off the <code>force_to_top</code> property, it would mean no data manipulation other than actually setting the <code>force_to_top</code> value to <code>false</code> again and the node would immediately drop back to its original position. And would also mean I don't need to create a storage area / extra tables / extra fields for the original <code>lft</code> and <code>rgt</code> values of each node.</p>\n\n<p>I've also thought about doing this in the php after I've fetched the results, but for large data sets that could really slow things down.</p>\n\n<p>I originally had to set the <code>force_to_top</code> nodes to the top of everything, which was very easy, simply <code>ORDER BY force_to_top, lft</code>, however now only forcing to the top of its siblings is a lot more complicated, as the node may be in the centre of a massive hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions or a point in the right direction would be much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","prepared-statement"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":28,"score":0,"question_id":13175623,"title":"How to convert a list object to bigdecimal in prepared statement?","body":"<p>I am using prepared statement for bulk insertion of records.

This uses the 'chef_gem' provider to install the 'mysql' rubygem.  As this is a native extension it needs to be compiled and, to do this, the development files for MySQL need to be installed.</p>\n\n<p>If I use the normal MySQL binaries everything works well as MySQL is already in the Centos repositories.  However, so that I can install the Percona packages, I need to ensure that the repo is in '/etc/yum.repos.d'.  The problem I am having is that I cannot get chef to do that work before attempting to install the mysql gem.</p>\n\n<p>So, what ends up happening is the system attempts to compile the mysql gem without the development header files for MySQL (Percona) being installed and, even if they are referenced correctly, they are not found as the repository has not been setup.</p>\n\n<p>I created a 'percona-repo' recipe that does this work using the 'yum' provider but it does not run before the 'chef_gem' does.  I know that chef has two phases for running and I am assuming that 'chef_gem' is gathering all gems up in the compile phase, regardless of where they are in the overall run list, and then installing all items requested at the beginning.  The repository recipe would then be run afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to play around with the Ruby recipe to do things like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>include_recipe \"mysql::percona_repo\"\n\nnode['mysql']['client']['packages'].each do |mysql_pack|\n    package mysql_pack do\n        action :nothing\n    end.run_action(:install)\nend\n\nchef_gem \"mysql\" do\n   action :nothing\nend.run_action(:install)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this does not work.  The chef_gem always runs before my \"precona_repo\" recipe, so the the package installs fail which, if it got that far, would mean that the ruby gem installation would also fail.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has any bright ideas on how I can solve this please let me know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the suggestion from Mark, I have now update the 'ruby' recipe so that I call the resources to add the new key and repo to the server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>resources(:yum_key =&gt; \"RPM-GPG-KEY-percona\").run_action(:add)\nresources(:yum_repository =&gt; \"Percona\").run_action(:add)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now I can see these being activated in the chef run.  However when I look at the filesystem the files are not there so the installation of the mysql client packages fails.</p>\n\n<p>I have done some digging around in the yum cookbook and have found that the provider for the yum_key attempts to run 'remote_file' to download the key as you would expect.  However this 'remote_file' is not running.  So then I tried to run this as a resource like the above but it has a variable in the name so I cannot call it effectively, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>remote_file \"/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/#{new_resource.key}\" do\n    ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think I am beginning to go down a bit of a rabbit warren here.  I will keep attempting to get the thing to work but any more ideas are most welcome.  I am trying not to go down the route of directly coding in the repo in this recipe as I prefer to reuse things that I know work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["mysql","query","count","group-by"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":49,"score":2,"question_id":13171133,"title":"Select maximum date with group by another columns","body":"<p>I have a table like:</p>\n\n<p><strong>gold_2012</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>gold_city | gold_type | gold_cost | gold_selltime\n--------------------------------------------------\ncity1     | type 1    | 41.23     | 2012-01-01   \ncity1     | type 1    | 42.23     | 2012-02-02   \ncity1     | type 1    | 40.23     | 2012-03-03   \ncity2     | type 2    | 43.23     | 2012-01-01   \ncity2     | type 2    | 45.23     | 2012-02-02   \ncity2     | type 2    | 47.23     | 2012-03-03   \ncity3     | type 3    | 48.23     | 2012-01-01   \ncity3     | type 3    | 49.23     | 2012-02-02   \ncity3     | type 3    | 44.23     | 2012-03-03   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I get 1 last result order by <code>gold_selltime</code> desc each group by <code>gold_city</code> and <code>gold_type</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I used this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT * , COUNT( * ) \nFROM  gold_2012\nGROUP BY  gold_type ,  gold_city\nORDER BY gold_selltime DESC\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it didn't work.<br>\nI only have result like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gold_city | gold_type | gold_cost | gold_selltime\n--------------------------------------------------\ncity1     | type 1    | 41.23     | 2012-01-01   \ncity2     | type 2    | 43.23     | 2012-01-01   \ncity3     | type 3    | 48.23     | 2012-01-01   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but I need it like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gold_city | gold_type | gold_cost | gold_selltime\n--------------------------------------------------\ncity1     | type 1    | 40.23     | 2012-03-03   \ncity2     | type 2    | 47.23     | 2012-03-03   \ncity3     | type 3    | 44.23     | 2012-03-03   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sorry!

So i added it manually with this content:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;Context&gt;\n     &lt;Resource name=\"jdbc/mkyongdb\" auth=\"Container\" type=\"javax.sql.DataSource\"\n           maxActive=\"50\" maxIdle=\"30\" maxWait=\"10000\"\n           username=\"root\" password=\"password\" \n           driverClassName=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\n           url=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mkyongdb\"/&gt;\n\n&lt;/Context&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then in web.xml, located in tomcat/conf i added:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;resource-ref&gt;\n&lt;description&gt;MySQL Datasource example&lt;/description&gt;\n&lt;res-ref-name&gt;jdbc/mkyongdb&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;\n&lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;\n&lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;\n&lt;/resource-ref&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed the same content in src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml and in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</p>\n\n<p>With all these configuration, the error mentioned above doesn't appears. But if i try to use hibernate adding </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;bean id=\"dataSource\" \n     class=\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"driverClassName\" value=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\" /&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"url\" value=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mkyongdb\" /&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"username\" value=\"root\" /&gt;\n&lt;property name=\"password\" value=\"password\" /&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n&lt;bean\n    id=\"sessionFactory\"\n    class=\"org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.annotation.AnnotationSessionFactoryBean\" &gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"dataSource\" &gt;\n        &lt;ref bean=\"dataSource\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"hibernateProperties\" &gt;\n        &lt;props&gt;\n            &lt;prop key=\"hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto\" &gt;create-drop&lt;/prop&gt;\n            &lt;prop key=\"hibernate.dialect\" &gt;org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect&lt;/prop&gt;\n            &lt;prop key=\"hibernate.show_sql\" &gt;true&lt;/prop&gt;\n        &lt;/props&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"annotatedClasses\" &gt;\n        &lt;list&gt;\n            &lt;value&gt;org.mose.grouporganizer.entity.AccelerometerFeatures&lt;/value&gt;\n        &lt;/list&gt;\n    &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then i get the comunication link failure.
