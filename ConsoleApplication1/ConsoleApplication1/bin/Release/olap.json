The moving average seems to be correct over the first 9 days, because their tuples all have the same hour ID, but when I get to the final day, instead of using the values from the previous 9 tuples, it performs the average over the previous 9 days with the 12 Hour ID.</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong here, is there a better way that I can filter my time dimension down to eliminate unwanted rows from my calculations?</p>\n"},{"tags":["scala","data-structures","olap"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":158,"score":5,"question_id":12980043,"title":"Is there a data structure / library to do in memory olap / pivot tables in Java / Scala?","body":"<h2>Relevant questions</h2>\n\n<p>This question is quite relevant, but is 2 years old: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4510343/in-memory-olap-engine-in-java\">In memory OLAP engine in Java</a> </p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>I would like to create a pivot-table like matrix from a given tabular dataset, in memory</p>\n\n<p>e.g. an age by marital status count (rows are age, columns are marital status).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The input</strong>: List of People, with age and some Boolean property (e.g. married), </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The desired output</strong>: count of People, by age (row) and isMarried (column)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What I've tried (Scala)</h2>\n\n<pre><code>case class Person(val age:Int, val isMarried:Boolean)\n\n...\nval people:List[Person] = ... //\n\nval peopleByAge = people.groupBy(_.age)  //only by age\nval peopleByMaritalStatus = people.groupBy(_.isMarried) //only by marital status\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I managed to do it the naive way, first grouping by age, then <code>map</code> which is doing a  <code>count</code> by marital status, and outputs the result, then I <code>foldRight</code> to aggregate</p>\n\n<pre><code>TreeMap(peopleByAge.toSeq: _*).map(x =&gt; {\n    val age = x._1\n    val rows = x._2\n    val numMarried = rows.count(_.isMarried())\n    val numNotMarried = rows.length - numMarried\n    (age, numMarried, numNotMarried)\n}).foldRight(List[FinalResult]())(row,list) =&gt; {\n     val cumMarried = row._2+ \n        (if (list.isEmpty) 0 else list.last.cumMarried) \n     val cumNotMarried = row._3 + \n        (if (list.isEmpty) 0 else l.last.cumNotMarried) \n     list :+ new FinalResult(row._1, row._2, row._3, cumMarried,cumNotMarried) \n}.reverse\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't like the above code, it's not efficient, hard to read, and I'm sure there is a better way.</p>\n\n<h2>The question(s)</h2>\n\n<p>How do I groupBy \"both\"? and how do I do a count for each subgroup, e.g. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How many people are exactly 30 years old and married?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another question, is how do I do a running total, to answer the question: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How many people above 30 are married?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all the great answers.</p>\n\n<p>just to clarify, I would like the output to include a \"table\" with the following columns </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Age (ascending)</li>\n<li>Num Married </li>\n<li>Num Not Married </li>\n<li>Running Total Married </li>\n<li>Running Total Not Married </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not only answering those specific queries, but to produce a report that will allow answering all such type of questions.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","ssas","mdx","olap"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":56,"score":0,"question_id":12975973,"title":"How Exactly Is NONEMPTY Working Here?","body":"<p>I have a cube with two measure groups, one in MOLAP format and the other in ROLAP format.

Basically users want to analyze the current state of their sale reps and territories, tweak territory boundaries and assignments in a \"what if\" scenario, then commit the changes if they like the way that scenario looks.  Each user can have a number of different scenarios to show his/her boss and when a scenario is approved then that becomes the new current state of the sales organization.  I'll be making heavy use of some combination of ROLAP and HOLAP to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>My boss and I are at odds on how to implement the scenario feature.  He has the executive level summary of how SSAS works and is leveraging his years of experience building database applications while I have been experimenting with SSAS for weeks and read the Kimball bible but I'm still relatively new to multidimensional modeling.  I just need some one who knows what their doing to approve, reject or tweak my idea which is as follows.</p>\n\n<p>I have a number of Type 2 SCD tables that look roughly like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Create Table SlowlyChangingDimension\n(\n    SurrogateId Int Identity(1,1) Not Null,\n    NaturalId NVarChar(50) Not Null,\n    BeginDate DateTime Not Null,\n    EndDate DateTime Not Null,\n    IsCurrent Bit Not Null,\n    IsCommitted Bit Not Null,\n    -- Data columns\n    Constraint PK_SlowlyChangingDimension Primary Key Clustered (SurrogateId),\n    Constraint Ck_SlowlyChangingDimension_DateRange Check (EndDate &gt; BeginDate)\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I maintain historical data through appropriate use of the BeginDate, EndDate and IsCurrent columns.  When new data comes in, I end the current version of the object and create a new current version.</p>\n\n<p>Now to handle scenarios, I want to add a scenario table that I will use to tag specific versions of objects in the SCD.  When a new scenario is created, I will tag the committed versions of each object in the SCD with the scenario.  Since the committed version can exist in multiple scenarios in this way, the M2M link will be facilitated by a bridge table.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the scenario has been created and it's initial state is identical to the committed state, the user can start making changes.  Changes will be stored in the SCD table as additional current rows where IsCommitted = False.  When a change is made, the scenario bridge table will be updated such that it drops the link to the committed version of the object and is now linked to the new alternate version of the object.  When a scenario is committed, the old committed version is ended, the alternate current version is committed and the scenario and all it's links to rows in the SCD table are deleted.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this sounds reasonable.  My boss however, wants to create additional schema elements at runtime when a new scenario is created such that scenario data is stored in separate tables and viewed through a separate cube.  This rubs me the wrong way because I'm pretty sure altering schema at runtime is an anti-pattern.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ssas","mdx","olap","cube"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":183,"score":0,"question_id":11249734,"title":"Add Dimension Attributes Using MDX script","body":"<p>Hello I want to know if is possible to modify a cube dimension in order to Add a New attribute through a MDX script.

(Tangentially, this seems to be the approach taken by <a href=\"http://jpivot.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jpivot</a>; e.g. I just clicked to drill down into a table in a jpivot example, and what got sent to the server wasn't MDX but simply the x-www-form-urlencoded string \"wcf65768426.x=3&amp;wcf65768426.y=3\".)</p></li>\n<li><p>In contrast, the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/xmla4js/\" rel=\"nofollow\">xmla4js</a> project seems premised on opening up a firewall port and exposing your OLAP server to the world (or at least to your particular customers) via XML/A, writing MDX queries in client-side javascript, and having the browser directly hit the OLAP server.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My gut reaction is to be quite suspicious of the second approach. It seems to presume that nothing bad can happen if someone were to execute arbitrary MDX statements against my OLAP server. I'm not yet a student of particularly advanced MDX, but it's not immediately obvious to me that this is a risk-free proposition. At very least someone could kick off some very expensive queries, or download a larger chunk of your dataset than you were hoping to easily make available to people.

But I find myself also wanting to try joining (in particular \"non-empty joining\") sets that have thousands or tens of thousands of items each, and it's not working well so far. I'm wondering if this could be made to work, or if I perhaps need to consider using something other than Mondrian/OLAP.</p>\n\n<p>To be concrete, I have a cube that records interactions between Firms (n=7000) and Clients (n=27000). Currently both Firm and Client are completely flat hierarchies; there's the All level and the individual-company level, with no other levels in between. There is a central fact table, and separate dimension tables for Firms and for Clients.</p>\n\n<p>My users at least appear to want to get summary reports along these lines, aggregating all the non-empty interactions between Firms and Clients:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n  [Measures].[Amount] on columns,\n  NonEmptyCrossJoin([Firm].Children,\n                      [Client].Children) on rows\nfrom MyCube\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this query and variations on it don't work in my test Mondrian setup. Either I get an OutOfMemoryException (on a 2GB Java heap), or Java seems to spend impossibly long time in mondrian.rolap.RolapResult$AxisMember.mergeTuple(TupleCursor). (I can provide a more complete stack trace if it would help.) By \"impossibly long\" I mean Java will stay slaving away at the query for hours and hours before I give up.</p>\n\n<p>I initially expected the above query to perform ok, because conceptually it could be done <em>somewhat</em> efficiently by just doing a SQL query along these lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select Firm, Client, Sum(Amount) as n\nfrom fact, firm, client\nwhere fact.firmid = firm.firmid and fact.clientid = client.clientid\ngroup by Firm, Client\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(In fact, if I execute something like this directly in MySql it doesn't take more than 15sec to execute.)</p>\n\n<p>But from the debug logs Mondrian doesn't seem to attempt this optimization.  Instead it appears to be doing the join internally, and in a way that ends up being particularly slow. I've set mondrian.native.crossjoin.enable=true in my mondrian.properties, but this doesn't seem like one of the join types that Mondrian is able to \"make native\".  (If I turn on mondrian.native.unsupported.alert=ERROR then I get the corresponding exception.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm left wondering whether I need to prevent my users from attempting joins on such large dimensions/sets, or whether Mondrian is maybe not the tool I'm looking for here.

I'm wondering if any of the major OLAP servers let you make measures that are <em>sets</em> of numbers, or <em>sets</em> of strings. (\"Set\" here is in the mathematical sense, not the OLAP jargon sense of \"a list of tuples\".) Whereas OLAP typically aggregates measures via numeric functions, my hypothetical \"set measures\" would be aggregated via set operations, e.g. set union or set intersection.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested both theoretically and practically. Theoretically/abstractly/mathematically, there's a nice parallel between addition-over-integers and union-over-sets, and it seems like someone could have considered this parallel in writing an OLAP server. (One potential implementation, if all the possible set members were known in advance, is to represent each set as a (potentially large) integer, and then to aggregate/union by performing bitwise OR.)</p>\n\n<p>As for practice, I'll attempt to provide a concrete case where this might seem at least marginally useful: Suppose you had a dataset where each fact was the metadata associated with an academic paper. Each paper might have a date, a topic, and a set of one or more authors, like so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fact1: {\"Year\": 1997, \"Topic\" : \"AI\", \"AuthorSet\": [\"Bill Jones\", \"Martha X\"]}</li>\n<li>fact2: {\"Year\": 1997, \"Topic\" : \"Linguistics\", \"AuthorSet\": [\"John Q\", \"Sam S\"]}</li>\n<li>fact3: {\"Year\": 1997, \"Topic\" : \"Linguistics\", \"AuthorSet\": [\"John Q\", \"Jack X\"]}</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(I'm using quasi-JSON here only because it helps make it obvious what's multi-valued.)</p>\n\n<p>If you created an OLAP cube around this data, it would seem very natural to be able to make a report showing how the set of authors writing on a given topic changed from year to year. In MDX, it might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n[Measures].[AuthorSet] on columns,\n[Year].[Year].All on rows\nwhere ([Topic].[Topic].[AI])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For each year, this query would roll up the list of authors via set union.</p>\n\n<p>To get the very most out of this feature you'd probably need custom OLAP client tools that knew about set measures in particular. But for existing clients you could probably just fall back to some string representation of a set. (e.g. the above query could return cells containing, e.g., the string \"Bill Jones; Martha X; John Q; Sam S; Jack X\")</p>\n\n<p>I'm most familiar with SSAS, and SSAS doesn't seem to support anything like this out of the box. It seems like there might be a way to hack it together using measures of string type, maybe plus custom CLR functions, but I haven't figured it out yet.</p>\n\n<p>This particular case you might also be able to solve in MDX only, maybe using custom members, Generate and SetToStr? (Solutions welcome!) But my intuition is that as things get more complicated it'd be more natural to have the set aggregation happen more naturally behind the scenes, with this \"set member\" functionality.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ssas","olap","olap-cube"],"answer_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":84,"score":0,"question_id":9076362,"title":"How to limit number of dimension combinations?","body":"<p>Lets say I have got a cube with 3 dimensions.

(I'm also curious to learn a little more about how OLAP engines handle strings.) The particular use case I have in mind is that I have a unique, pre-existing \"record description\" for each of my OLAP facts, and I want to put those descriptions in the cube so that I have the option to get them back when I do a DRILLTHROUGH operation. In contrast, I don't need the record descriptions to appear when doing normal pivot table / aggregate type operations. (The descriptions are too long to display sensibly in a pivot table, plus each fact has a unique description, meaning it doesn't make sense to aggregate over descriptions.) My current dataset has around 700,000 facts, though I'm also curious if the answer would change for larger datasets.</p>\n\n<p>My hope was that an OLAP server could do something sensible if I put these long strings in a cube. In the Sql Server / SSAS case in particular, I thought perhaps I'd put them in a dimension marked as ROLAP, to save memory usage, and use a degenerate dimension (aka a \"fact dimension\", in SSAS terminology), to avoid needless ETL complexities. But I'm curious if this would be regarded as a horrible practice for some reason, or if there are any hidden gotchas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: My example use case is where you have a string associated with each OLAP fact. But it might also be instructive to consider the case where the strings are instead associated with each particular value of a particular dimension.

I'm wondering if Mondrian can do the same.</p>\n\n<h1>Background: Bridge Table Pattern</h1>\n\n<p>I've been learning about modeling multi-valued dimensions in OLAP, and in particular have been exploring the Bridge Pattern approach. (See, e.g., Kimball Group's <a href=\"http://www.kimballgroup.com/html/10dt/DT124AlternativesMulti-valuedDimensions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Design Tip #124 Alternatives for Multi-valued Dimensions</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>To review, the basic idea with bridge tables is rather than have</p>\n\n<p>fact_table -> dimension table</p>\n\n<p>you have</p>\n\n<p>fact_table -> bridge table -> dimension table</p>\n\n<p>Bridge table is n:m, which means that each fact is ultimately associated with multiple values of a given dimension (say, multiple customers), rather than just a single value.</p>\n\n<p>This approach has some nice properties, but it raises the possibility of messing up your aggregates if you're not careful. For example, if you had a transaction fact table row with SalesAmount=$3.30, then once your OLAP stack joins the fact_table and the bridge_table, there will now be <em>k</em> rows with SalesAmount=$3.30. If things get summed naively, you risk effectively proceeding as if that one transaction brought in k * $3.30, rather than just $3.30.</p>\n\n<h1>Background: What Sql Server / SSAS can apparently do</h1>\n\n<p>As I gathered <a href=\"http://sqlcat.com/sqlcat/b/technicalnotes/archive/2008/02/11/analysis-services-should-you-use-many-to-many-dimensions.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, some OLAP tools can use some cleverness to avoid this sort of \"double counting\". For instance, apparently if you tell SQL Server/SSAS that you're dealing with a many-to-many relationship (e.g. where each Sale can be associated with n \"Sales Reasons\"), then a straightforward MDX query like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n  [Measures].[Internet Sales Amount]\non columns,\n  [Sales Reason].[Sales Reason].members\non rows\nfrom [Adventure Works]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>treats things as sanely as possible as both at the individual sales reason level (e.g. \"On Promotion\") and at the aggregate \"All Sales Reasons\" level. In particular, the resulting row for \"On Promotion\" will sum across all the sales facts for which \"On Promotion\" was one of the reasons recorded. And the row for \"All Sales Reasons\" will include the sum of all sales, period, regardless of reason. In particular, the \"All\" aggregate will not double-count sales facts in cases where multiple sales reasons -- e.g. \"On Promotion\" and \"Price\" -- were both recorded.</p>\n\n<h1>Can Mondrian do this too?</h1>\n\n<p>So far Mondrian, unlike SSAS, doesn't seem to provide a way to indicate that a relationship is \"multi-valued\" or \"many-to-many\". Am I right about this?</p>\n\n<p>If Mondrian won't give me any extra help, then if I want to use the Bridge Table pattern I seem to need to jump through some hoops to get aggregates to work right both at the particular-value level and at the \"All\" level of a multi-valued dimension.. The Design Tip #124 document (above), for example, recommends making use of a \"weighting factor\" in the bridge table. That can help to make sure the \"All\" values come out right, but I suspect it has the side-effect of making measures come out wrong/arbitrarily if I drill down to the particular-value level. There might be a way around it by crafting more clever MDX expressions, but I'm not sure yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":["ssas","relationship","olap","dimension","fact-table"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":353,"score":0,"question_id":8054293,"title":"Analysis Services OLAP - Dimension Usage Relationship Type","body":"<p>I was hoping someone could explain the appropriate use of the 'FACT Relationship Type' under the  Dimension Usage tab.

If i create a country dimension, and specify those 15 properties as dimensional attributes, every time i process my cube, it will do a \"select distinct continent from country\" x15 (once per each attribute) in order to get that distinct list of continents. if Country table is huge (which in my case it is a view comprised of many big tables), it will take a very long time just to get that list of distinct values per dimension. </p>\n\n<p>my attempt above is just a way to work around this problem, and have separate table per dimension that i could easily manage. my only problem is that i have sub views which need to be aggregated on those properties, while the properties do not exist on sub tables and need to be looked up from \"country\" view etc.. </p>\n"},{"tags":["oracle","olap","xmla"],"answer_count":2,"favorite_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":371,"score":0,"question_id":6125830,"title":"Opensource or free online Oracle OLAP Server or Offline Oracle Cube file","body":"<p>Is there any free online Oracle OLAP servers available for testing? or Is there any offline cube available for Oracle like (.cub) in SSAS.</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","synchronization","ssas","olap","data-synchronization"],"answer_count":1,"favorite_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":237,"score":0,"question_id":7410207,"title":"SQL Server 2005 Analysis Service (SSAS) Partial Synchronization","body":"<p>I'm new to SSAS (this is my first project that involves ssas).</p>\n\n<p>I have a regular a SQL Server 2005 server (say Blah) that run database instance and sql server analysis service.

The database tracks events: when they occur, what type are, where they occurred.  The fact table is a precalculated summary of events for each 10 minute interval. </p>\n\n<p>So I set up my cube and I use the browser to view all my attributes at once: total counts per area per type over time, with drill down from Year down to the 10 Minute Interval.  Reports are similar in performance to the browse.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, it's snappy enough.  But as I get deeper into the drill-tree, it takes longer to view each level.  Finally at the minute level it seems to take 20 minutes or so before it displays the mere 6 records.

I would expect that going to Quarters or Years would take longest, since it has to aggregate all the data up.  Going to the lowest metric, filtered down heavily to around 180 cells (6 intervals, 10 types, 3 areas), seems like it should be fastest.

So most hierarchies are natural anyway but the most commonly requested hierarchy is 3 or more levels with a middle level as a slowly changing attribute.</p>\n\n<p>The scenario is tracking jobs.  The job has many attributes which are all static but the Debtor attribute (i.e. who's paying the invoice) can change over the course of the job.  So the hierarchies look like this</p>\n\n<pre><code> - Manager -&gt; Debtor -&gt; Job Name\n - Director -&gt; Debtor -&gt; Job Name \n - Office -&gt; Debtor -&gt; Job Name \n - Office -&gt; Manager -&gt; Debtor -&gt; Job Name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So within the dimension there are many hierarchies that start with static attribute(s) of the job followed by the debtor (wich slowly changes) with the job name (dimension key) at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>So what we do at the moment to \"naturalize\" these hierarchies is create \"fake\" attributes for each debtor that appears in a hierarchy that is a combination of the attributes above it.  e.g. for the first example above the Debtor level attribute would have a key of Manager and Debtor id's.  And for the last example the Manager level would have a key of Manager and Office and the Debtor level attribute would have a key of Office, Manager &amp; Debtor.  We then hide all these attributes so they are only used in the hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>So this makes our dimensions a lot more complicated but we do get the benefit of extra performance on our queries.  Often this is a noticeable improvement.  Apart from complexity we constantly hit problems because we now have multiple versions of a \"Debtor\" and the key of the attribute is not the id of the debtor.  So this affects Drillthrough and Reporting actions as well as making certain types of calculation more difficult if we want to change behaviour for certain levels.</p>\n\n<p>The clients we use are Reporting Services, Excel and Office Web Components.</p>\n\n<p>I've been told that on early versions of SQL 2005 complex queries involving unnatural hierarchies could result in the server getting completely tied in knots which is another reason we've gone to great lengths to avoid unnatural hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the exclamation mark design warning is so dramatic in Visual Studio that it seems like a really bad thing to have unnatural hierachies.</p>\n\n<p>What do other designers do in these situations?

So I would already know what the numbers were for a year, a given month, a given week, and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range I use the various scales to quickly add up something that gives the right results but I don't have to necessarily reprocess the full data set, I just retrieve four or five records and add or subtract them.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a real pattern?

I have a feeling that, if I could get rid of the subqueries, the result would be much more efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than show you my actual schema (which is much more complicated), I'll show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and data model.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that I have a database of concert information, with artists and venues.

In this model, the 'artist_tag' and 'venue_tag' tables function as fact tables, and everything else is a dimension.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note, in this example, that the queries are much simpler to write if I only allow the user to constrain against a single artist_tag or venue_tag value. It only gets really tricky when I allow the queries to include AND logic, requiring multiple distinct tags.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: what are the best techniques that you know of for writing efficient queries against multiple fact tables?</p>\n"},{"tags":["sql-server","sql-server-2005","ssas","olap","business-intelligence"],"answer_count":4,"favorite_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":2125,"score":2,"question_id":332535,"title":"What is the best way to use SQL Server Analysis Services data in a line of business application?","body":"<p>We'd like to see if we can get some improved performance for analysis and reporting by moving some of our key data into Analysis Services cubes.
